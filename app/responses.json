    "0": "Struggles and victories with self-care:\n\nThank you for sharing your experiences. Based on what you’ve written, you’ve been having difficulties with everyday tasks and self-care. Brushing your teeth, eating regularly or staying in touch with others might feel overwhelming, or perhaps you’ve felt empty and lacking in the motivation to do these things.\nStruggles with seemingly small routines might be connected to a deeper, persistent low mood or lack of positive feeling. These are the kinds of experience that a lot of people use the word “depression” to describe.\nIn time, you might explore how to create structure and routines in ways that feel manageable for you, allowing you to do them in the way that works for you. If a car has completely stalled and we try to move it, it will be a short while before there is any observable motion. Persistent effort is often more important than big gains. In CBT for depression, the first step is often making these small nudges to our activity levels and routines.\nIf you were to speak to a therapist, you might also want to address any feelings of shame or inadequacy, particularly if they are related to your body. Some people who have experienced neglect from others, emotional wounds related to their body, or lack of clear guidance growing up can later struggle with the daily work of self-care and motivation. Parts of you made need nurturance, reassurance or to have their efforts witnessed. You could enlist your therapist’s help in observing habitual ways of talking to yourself, particularly if they are discouraging or critical. With time, new ways of talking to ourselves can be reinforced.\nEach small step towards caring for yourself might be more significant than it initially seems. It might be important to acknowledge these efforts, however modest. You might also consider reaching out for support, connecting with others who share similar experiences (e.g., in low mood support groups), or simply noticing and gently challenging unhelpful beliefs. These little actions could start making a genuine difference over time.",
    "1": "Self-harm and strong emotions:\nThank you for sharing your experiences. Your response aligns most with feeling intense emotions that are overwhelming or uncontrollable, sometimes leading to thoughts of self-harm as a way to cope or regain a sense of control. \nSome people who self-harm find themselves caught between fragile moments of hope that are then followed by deep crisis. Self-harm can become a way to interrupt feelings or prevent being emotionally flooded. Many people who have self-harmed or thought about self-harm struggle with feelings of shame, secrecy, or isolation, making it difficult to share these experiences openly or seek support. \nOf course, the first step is to ensure your basic physical safety. If you do harm yourself, try and do it in as safe a way as possible. Searching “harm minimisation” can help you find tips from people with similar experiences, and alternative strategies for managing strong emotions. \nIt could be helpful to explore ways of managing these intense feelings differently. This might be through a therapy that helps you navigate emotional overwhelm safely, without including an absolute prohibition on self-harm if you still need to be allowed it. Therapeutic conversations might guide you towards your 'Wise Mind,' where emotional insights meet rational understanding. Gradually practicing how to express difficult emotions openly to other people, even in very small or tentative ways, could become a significant step toward feeling less isolated and more supported. \nNoticing and celebrating the moments when you manage to cope differently might be important, even if you are doubtful about where it’s taking you. If it feels possible, you might experiment with building connections—whether with trusted individuals, supportive communities, or professionals who understand these feelings. Small acts of reaching out or sharing your experiences, as intimidating as they might initially seem, could gradually ease the weight of secrecy and isolation over time.",
    "2": "Struggles with medication:\nThanks for sharing your experiences. It sounds like you have been particularly concerned by medications. Your writing indicates that there has been uncertainty or distress for you around medication options, perhaps dealing with challenging side effects, rapid changes in prescriptions, or not being heard by professionals. \nGetting and taking medications for a mental health issue can be a difficult process. It can raise conflicts about how you define the struggles you’re going through, how they fit with your identity, and what agency you have. Some people face stigma from family, friends or employers if they admit to using psychiatric medication. Experiences like being dismissed, misunderstood, or invalidated by professionals can add layers of mistrust or exhaustion. \nTherapy could offer you an opportunity to explore these feelings of uncertainty and frustration in a supportive space, gently shifting the conversation from "What medication should I take?" towards deeper questions like "How do I want to live?" This process might help you reconnect with your sense of choice and agency, considering medication as just one tool among many available to support your mental health. Engaging in open, reflective dialogue might allow you to regain a clearer sense of control over decisions that affect your well-being. \nIf it feels helpful, you might consider reaching out to peer communities for additional validation or reassurance, particularly if clinical experiences have left you feeling isolated or disempowered. There are plenty online. Sharing experiences with others who understand can sometimes reduce the burden of existential fatigue. You might find ways to clarify what feels right for you—moving toward a path that aligns more closely with your own values and desired quality of life, or confidence about exercising your own judgements rather than relying on others for guidance.",
    "3": "Experiences of anxiety:\nThank you for sharing your experience. It relates particularly to anxiety, including the physical sensations of anxiety such as a racing heart, dizziness, chest tightness, or tingling sensations. It's possible you're wrestling with uncertainty around whether these sensations reflect genuine physical health issues, anxiety, or both, making it difficult to trust your own body or find a reliable sense of safety. It’s also simply unpleasant to go through the day feeling afraid. \nYou might use a therapy to disentangle the relationship between your emotions, behaviours and thoughts, to see how cycles of anxiety are set in motion. Therapies like CBT usually take a decidedly active approach, encouraging you to challenge your beliefs through experimentation: Can I survive this situation? You might learn strategies that promote a sense of grounding, reassurance, and emotional clarity to help you get through the most intense episodes. \nIf it feels manageable, seeking validation from others who have had similar experiences might help alleviate feelings of isolation or doubt. Sharing these experiences could gently reassure you that you're not alone in experiencing anxiety and may provide practical insights into managing these intense sensations. You can visit many forums online where people share their experience of anxiety. Over time, by carefully experimenting with different coping strategies or therapeutic practices, you might find new ways of navigating these difficult experiences and reconnecting with a sense of security in your body.",
    "4": "Anxieties about being seen or judged:\nThanks for sharing your experiences. Your writing suggests that you struggle with social anxieties, or anxieties about how others perceive, judge, or respond to you. \nYou might find yourself worrying about being misunderstood or disliked. You might find yourself carefully analysing conversations before and afterwards or feeling embarrassed or ashamed about how you've come across, sometimes replaying interactions repeatedly in your mind. In conversation with others, you might feel acutely self-conscious and be watching your every move closely. \nSomewhere, you might want to be understood and noticed by other people, but it’s frightening to risk being rejected, or dismissed by others, especially if you were to share your feelings or expressing vulnerability. \nYou might identify with elements of what people call “social phobia”. This is a formal diagnosis that people sometimes use to describe the disabling impact of this kind of anxiety. \nTherapy might give you space to explore these anxieties more openly. Lots of people take many years to seek help for social anxieties. Therapy might help you examine patterns such as people-pleasing, conflict avoidance, or freezing when confronted with criticism or authority. It could be helpful to explore ways of gradually expressing your needs and feelings to people that you trust, and dealing with people that you don’t or whose reactions are dispiriting. Building this understanding might help you develop a more balanced perspective on your interactions and experiences, so that you can interact with people in ways that suit you, not just how you think you’re told you should be. \nTherapies like CBT for social phobia contain many specific techniques that have been shown to help people experiment with and adjust to social situations. \nIf it feels manageable, considering connections with supportive individuals or communities who share similar anxieties could be valuable. You can do that by visiting forums online if interacting in person feels too intense. Recognizing that you're not alone in these feelings might gently reduce your sense of isolation or shame. Over time, and with gentle practice, you might find it easier to experience relationships with less anxiety and more authenticity, gradually increasing your comfort in being seen and understood.",
    "5": "Frustrations with being invalidated, misrepresented or misunderstood:\nThank you for sharing your experiences. They speak to a profound frustration or anger at having your emotions invalidated, misrepresented, or treated superficially by others. It may be that you've felt dismissed, pathologized, or misunderstood by those meant to support you. It can be frustrating to see this misunderstanding reflected in broader societal attitudes, or to have experiences of discrimination, systemic neglect or harmful portrayals of mental health issues. Perhaps this has applied across several relationships or times in your life.\nYou may need to take your time to choosing a therapist, looking for someone who you think who has the willingness to listen carefully. Sometimes it is more useful to find a therapist who can work through misunderstandings with you, rather than someone who understands you well straight away. Tolerating being misunderstood might be an important part of the work. Exploring these feelings in therapy could offer you a space not only to process your individual experiences but also to articulate and clarify your reactions to broader injustices. You might need to explore advocating for yourself effectively and navigate relationships or systems that contribute to your sense of invalidation. This approach could gradually help you reclaim your voice, identity, and sense of dignity. If you belong to a group that has been discriminated against – a race, sexuality, gender, faith or other protected characteristic – you may want to check whether your therapist understands the context sufficiently.\nIf it feels helpful, you might consider connecting with communities or voices who share your critical reflection or moral outrage about how mental illness is frequently portrayed or handled. Engaging with these perspectives might provide validation and a sense of solidarity, helping reduce feelings of isolation or invisibility. Over time, this shared understanding could contribute to your ability to assert your experiences authentically, challenge harmful narratives, and participate in meaningful change.",
    "6": "System fatigue and loss of hope:\nThanks for sharing your experiences. It sounds like you are exhausted from repeated attempts to seek effective support—perhaps after trying multiple therapies, medications, or treatments without lasting improvement. You might find yourself going between brief flickers of hope followed by painful experiences of disappointment or abandonment. This cycle could leave you feeling burnt out, isolated, and unsure whether meaningful support is truly possible.\nYou might be coming to therapy feeling quite deflated or sceptical, even if you do your best to be friendly and tolerant. It might be helpful to discuss these doubts openly with your therapist, to see whether they can be tolerated between you. \nTherapy might need to acknowledge not only your personal suffering but also the ways the mental health system may have let you down. Therapeutic support might focus less on trying to 'fix' you and more on carefully rebuilding your trust, dignity, and sense of agency. Such an approach could help you gradually reconnect with meaningful and consistent care, without the exhausting burden of repeatedly retelling your trauma or navigating impersonal systems.\nIf it feels manageable, you might consider connecting with low-barrier, high-trust services or communities that genuinely reflect and validate your experiences. Sharing your story in a space where you feel heard might ease feelings of isolation and despair. Over time, engaging with care that respects your experiences and understands your journey might gradually rekindle your sense of hope and possibility.",
    "7": "Night drift: Sleep as escape, day as burden:\nThank you for sharing your experiences. Your writing speaks to a complicated relationship with nighttime and sleep. Perhaps you find yourself deliberately staying awake late into the night, not necessarily due to insomnia, but because the arrival of sleep feels like surrendering to the pressures and pains of the next day. Nighttime might have become a sanctuary—a quiet, expectation-free zone where you can briefly escape emotional exhaustion or find moments of fragile peace. Dreams might feel like a comforting refuge, while daylight hours can seem relentlessly demanding or overwhelming.\nIf you haven’t already, you might want to Google “sleep hygiene”. This is a basic set of tips that can help you rest. You may already have tried most of them: It’s just a first step to make sure that the ground is prepared.\nIf you’re seeking a therapy, it might be important to discuss these rhythms and acknowledge your nighttime needs without forcing rigid routines on it too soon. Approaches like journaling, dream work, or calming nighttime practices might help you map out your relationship to night and day. You might explore ways of reclaiming agency over your experience of time, addressing underlying emotional fatigue, dissociation, or the psychological pressures that comes with daytime.\nIf you have marked issues with settling your mind, or coping with change and sensory stimuli, you might want to read about “neurodiversity”. This doesn’t necessarily mean getting a label, but to benefit from discussions that are helping us recognise the diversity of our cognition and how differently different people see things.\nConnecting with others who experience similar struggles could provide comfort and validation, helping you feel less alone in navigating this complex emotional relationship with sleep and wakefulness. Over time, understanding and accepting your personal needs might gradually help rebalance your days and nights in ways that feel more tolerable and meaningful.",
    "8": "Cognitive fog and self-erosion:\nOne of the main struggles you might be experiencing could involve a sense of gradual cognitive decline—perhaps noticing difficulties with memory, concentration, or mental clarity. You might find yourself feeling detached, foggy, or as though you're not as sharp or capable as you once were. The experience might go beyond simply feeling low or sad; it could feel as though your very sense of self, your abilities, and your personality are slowly eroding or becoming unfamiliar. Perhaps you've even found yourself grieving the person you used to be—a curious thinker, a creative spirit, or someone who easily navigated life's complexities.\nTherapeutic support could gently acknowledge this deeply unsettling feeling of cognitive fog or self-loss as a genuine and common aspect of depression, one that many people experience. You might benefit from exploring small, structured ways to rebuild routines or engage in activities that gently reconnect you with your sense of competence and self-worth. Techniques like metaphor-based journaling could also offer supportive pathways, helping you express and reframe your experiences without shame, allowing room for the possibility of rediscovering and redefining your identity.\nIf it feels manageable, connecting with others who share similar struggles might also help reduce feelings of isolation or fear about these cognitive changes. Understanding that these experiences can be common in depression—and that they don't reflect permanent loss—could gradually ease the emotional burden. Over time, the path to recovery might become less about reclaiming exactly who you once were, and more about discovering new ways to rebuild a self that feels authentic, capable, and worth embracing.",
    "9": "Disordered thoughts and dissociation:\nOne of the main struggles you might be experiencing could involve intense feelings of dissociation, reality distortion, or overwhelming mental chaos. You might feel as though reality has become distant, unreal, or dreamlike, perhaps even questioning whether you exist as yourself or as a character within a simulation. Thoughts might become intrusive, overwhelming, or fragmented, not necessarily linked to sadness but arising from an intense mental pressure that feels frighteningly out of control.\nTherapy might provide you with careful support that acknowledges the genuine terror and confusion associated with these experiences, rather than dismissing or trivializing them. You might find it helpful to explore grounding techniques or gentle strategies to manage intrusive thoughts or sensory overload, without feeling invalidated or misunderstood. Therapeutic conversations could also offer compassionate reframing of obsessive thought spirals, providing relief from mental loops that currently feel relentless or terrifying.\nIf it feels manageable, you might consider connecting with supportive communities or resources specifically geared toward understanding dissociation, trauma, or neurodivergent experiences. Recognizing that you’re not alone in navigating this chaotic internal landscape could gradually lessen feelings of isolation or helplessness. Over time, by gently building skills and understanding, you might find it possible to reclaim moments of stability and self-awareness—even amidst the storm.",
    "10": "Cycles of emotional instability and identity confusion:\nOne of the main struggles you might be facing could involve intense, unpredictable shifts in mood or identity—moments where you find yourself rapidly moving between extremes like euphoria and despair, energy and paralysis, or joy and deep fear. These aren't just ordinary mood swings; they can feel explosive, confusing, and sometimes frighteningly out of control. You might also experience mixed states, feeling simultaneously energized yet deeply depressed, which can be particularly distressing and difficult to understand.\nTherapeutic support might gently help you manage these volatile experiences by providing simple, repeatable grounding techniques or coping strategies to handle intense mood spirals or urges toward self-harm. You could benefit from conversations that carefully validate your experiences without romanticizing their intensity, helping you navigate feelings of anger, shame, or confusion around your shifting sense of self or unstable identity. It might also help to gently explore your concerns about diagnosis or accessing care, reassuring you that uncertainty doesn’t mean your struggles are imagined or invalid.\nIf it feels manageable, connecting with peers who experience similar states of instability or identity confusion could provide genuine reassurance that you’re not alone. Recognizing these experiences as shared by others can gently ease feelings of isolation or shame. Over time, this approach might help you become more comfortable seeking longer-term support, gradually finding stability within what currently feels chaotic and uncertain.",
    "11": "Existential confusion and obsessive fears:\nOne of the main struggles you might be experiencing could involve deeply unsettling, intrusive thoughts or obsessive fears—perhaps even thoughts that contradict your values or sense of identity. You might find yourself caught in relentless cycles of worry about becoming psychotic or having a serious, undiagnosed illness, despite reassurance from doctors or others. It can feel exhausting and isolating to constantly doubt your perceptions, your health, or even your moral worth, leaving you trapped in a loop of anxiety, shame, and obsessive checking.\nTherapeutic support could gently help you explore these distressing thoughts and fears in ways that carefully acknowledge their intensity without reinforcing their power over you. Strategies such as mindfulness or cognitive reframing might gradually allow you to gain some distance from obsessive cycles, easing your reliance on constant reassurance-seeking or symptom-checking behaviors. Over time, therapy could help you rebuild trust in your perceptions and regain a sense of inner safety, gently addressing the deeper existential confusion beneath these fears.\nIf it feels manageable, connecting with others experiencing similar struggles might help you feel less alone or ashamed about your experiences. Recognizing that these obsessive fears and existential confusions are shared by many could offer meaningful validation, reducing your sense of isolation. Gradually, you might discover that despite these frightening thoughts, your true self remains intact—and deserving of support and compassion.",
    "12": "Still walking but emotionally exhausted:\nOne of the main struggles you might be experiencing could involve feeling emotionally empty or deeply disconnected, even as you maintain a seemingly functional life. Perhaps you're managing daily responsibilities—going to work, caring for yourself externally—but internally, there's a profound absence of joy, excitement, or even sadness. Activities you once enjoyed, like hobbies, creative pursuits, or social interactions, might now feel hollow or meaningless, leaving you grieving the person you used to be.\nTherapeutic support might gently acknowledge the exhausting contradiction of appearing outwardly capable while inwardly feeling emotionally depleted or numb. Therapy could offer you space to safely express this hidden pain without the pressure of needing to appear more visibly broken to justify your suffering. You might benefit from exploring gentle, manageable steps toward reconnecting with small moments of genuine enjoyment or meaning, slowly rebuilding your relationship with the parts of life that currently feel unreachable or overwhelming.\nIf it feels manageable, connecting with others who share similar experiences might help validate your quiet struggle and ease feelings of guilt or shame about not seeming "ill enough" to deserve help. Understanding that many people quietly endure similar emotional exhaustion might gently lessen your isolation. Over time, through patient and compassionate exploration, you might gradually rediscover moments of authentic connection and meaning, easing the relentless weight of daily existence.",
    "13": "Push and pull in relationships and coping by destroying:\nOne of the main struggles you might be experiencing could involve a deep sense of confusion, self-blame, or emotional turmoil in your relationships. You might yearn for meaningful connections, yet frequently find yourself feeling undeserving or fearing that you unintentionally sabotage closeness. Your emotional experiences may swing rapidly from hope to despair, sometimes manifesting as intense dependency or a profound fear of abandonment. The resulting shame, impulsivity, or emotional numbness can feel overwhelming, leaving your sense of self uncertain and fragile.\nIf you've recently experienced sudden relational loss or rejection (Subcluster A), you might find yourself grappling with intense panic, grief, or even thoughts of self-harm. The sudden absence of someone important can feel like a profound rupture, shaking your self-worth and identity deeply.\nIf your distress arises from academic or work pressures (Subcluster B), the fear of failing to meet expectations might be driving intense anxiety, self-criticism, or feelings of hopelessness. Your identity might feel entangled with productivity, making setbacks feel catastrophic and deeply personal.\nYou might also carry the profound, heavy impact of lifelong familial neglect or complex trauma (Subcluster C). Chronic feelings of invalidation or being a burden might leave you persistently contemplating suicidality, yearning deeply to be understood while also feeling resigned to isolation.\nAlternatively, your coping strategy might involve isolating yourself to avoid burdening others (Subcluster D). You might withdraw from friends or relationships during periods of distress, experiencing guilt and loneliness despite desperately wanting connection.\nIf you're observing someone else's emotional turmoil and feeling confused or helpless (Subcluster E), you might struggle to make sense of their behavior, navigating complex boundaries and your own role in their emotional landscape.\nThe societal pressure to mask your struggles or function despite deep distress might weigh heavily on you (Subcluster F). Shame around needing accommodations or fear of invalidation from others might compel you to hide your pain, intensifying feelings of isolation.\nFinally, perhaps you cope by using humor or detachment to manage your emotional pain (Subcluster G). Dark or self-deprecating humor might help you navigate intrusive thoughts or emotional overwhelm, offering brief moments of relief and insight amidst the chaos.\nTherapeutic support might gently help you explore these complex emotional patterns, carefully addressing self-destructive impulses and relational difficulties while offering compassionate understanding. Gradually, therapy might help rebuild your self-worth, establish clearer relational boundaries, and cultivate coping strategies that support genuine emotional connection and stability. Connecting with others who share similar experiences could further ease feelings of isolation, providing reassurance that your pain, however complex, is genuinely understood.",
    "14": "Suicidal feelings and wishing not to exist:\nOne of the main struggles you might be experiencing could involve persistent, often deeply private thoughts about not existing or a quiet wish to escape life itself. These feelings might not always come from an active desire to die; rather, you might feel caught between not wanting to live and not wanting to hurt or burden others. Perhaps you find yourself using imaginative coping strategies—fantasies of disappearing, becoming a ghost, or even accidental death—as a way to endure these relentless feelings without alarming others.\nTherapy could provide a carefully supportive space where these profound, existential feelings can be acknowledged without fear of judgment, shock, or repeated, tiring risk assessments. You might benefit from exploring the philosophical or societal dimensions of your pain—whether related to personal alienation, exhaustion from societal expectations, or frustration with insensitive mental health responses. Therapy could gently help you articulate these experiences and find ways to hold onto small, meaningful anchors—like a beloved pet or a single supportive connection—that quietly sustain you.\nIf it feels manageable, cautiously engaging with communities or professionals who sensitively understand the complex, nuanced nature of chronic suicidality might also provide comfort and validation. Knowing you aren't alone in experiencing this persistent existential pain—and feeling genuinely understood rather than pathologized—could gradually ease your sense of isolation. Over time, this supportive exploration could help you reconnect with moments of genuine meaning, gently fostering resilience not as hollow positivity, but as an authentic response to your lived experience.",
    "15": "Moments that saved you:\nOne of the main experiences you might recognize is having faced moments of intense emotional vulnerability or despair—moments when things felt so overwhelming that continuing seemed nearly impossible. Yet somehow, in those crucial instances, something small and unexpected might have reached you—perhaps a kind word from a stranger, a meaningful conversation, or even the simple pleasure of tasting something sweet—and subtly shifted your perspective. These moments may not have solved everything, but they gave you just enough connection, hope, or relief to carry on.\nTherapeutic support could offer you a space to explore these powerful turning points more deeply, gently helping you recognize the strength and resilience these moments represent. In therapy, you might also safely revisit what these experiences mean to you, understanding more clearly how small acts of compassion or serendipity can make a genuine difference even at the hardest times. This exploration could help you identify what feels authentically meaningful and supportive, gradually building on these unexpected lifelines.\nIf it feels manageable, sharing or hearing similar stories from others who've faced these vulnerable moments might offer additional comfort or reassurance. Recognizing these shared experiences could deepen your sense of connection and community, highlighting the profound impact even the smallest gestures of empathy can have. Over time, acknowledging and celebrating these small but pivotal moments could help you foster genuine hope, rooted not in superficial positivity, but in the powerful and authentic reality of human connection.",
    "20": "What is wrong with me?:\nOne of the main struggles you might be experiencing could involve uncertainty or confusion about your mental health—perhaps you've recently received a diagnosis, or maybe you're still wondering what exactly feels wrong or uncomfortable. You might be wrestling with questions about whether your experiences fit neatly into a label or diagnosis, or feeling unsure about medications, side effects, or long-term outcomes. It's completely understandable if you're finding it difficult to clearly describe what's happening internally or why you're unhappy.\nTherapeutic support could gently help you explore this uncertainty, giving you space to experiment with describing your feelings and experiences without pressure to immediately find the "right" diagnosis or explanation. Therapy might offer a supportive environment to safely express doubts, fears, or curiosity about mental health, medication, or your identity. It could help you carefully examine your thoughts and feelings, encouraging you to keep exploring, even if you're not yet sure how to put everything into words.\nIf it feels manageable, you could consider continuing to experiment with describing your experiences—perhaps submitting another prompt here or exploring your thoughts further in therapy or supportive conversations. Over time, by gently allowing yourself space for exploration and uncertainty, you might gradually find clarity and understanding about what genuinely resonates with your experiences and needs."
