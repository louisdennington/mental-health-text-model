Please help I don\u2019t know what to do.", "1jh178o": "I don't know what to do anymore. (Using a throwaway as my friends+mom know and follow my main account.) I've never had it diagnosed but I know I have *some* kind of anxiety problem. I have been absolutely TERRIFIED of losing my teeth/having them rot out for as long as I can remember. I distinctly remember losing my first baby tooth and I had what I can only describe as an anxiety attack and not telling my parents because I was so scared. I'm 16 now and I've only been to the dentist once in my life, at 7. Another problem is that, and I'm not sure why, but my parents had never really done very much to make sure me or my siblings really took care of our dental health, which I think has made it just become worse with time. So there was no 'brush your teeth before bed, brush your teeth in the morning' sort of thing, or going to the dentist, and I'm imagining most parents *make* their kids do it. And that's not really to say that this is entirely their fault because I love my parents so much and I honestly do think most of this is probably my fault. Only saying that it let me get away with never brushing my teeth as a kid, even if I knew I should have been. I didn't brush my teeth because I was too scared to do it (I started doing it every day right after I turned 13 though, so that was pretty big for me). So it eventually became all I thought about every day. My parents knew about this since I was pretty young, I've told them on several occasions about just how truly bad it is, and I don't know why but it just never came up to do anything about the underlying mental issue. My teeth have never looked great. They're not rotted black or anything quite as extreme as that but they don't look nice and I keep getting afraid that they will eventually get to that point. I can't laugh or smile without thinking about how awful I must look. Last year I spent my entire summer rotting in my room from the anxiety because I *thought* I saw something black on a molar (It doesn't look like that anymore, I believe it was in my head or something to that effect). It took months of building up courage but I finally told my mom that I wanted to go to the dentist again, she said she'd look into it, and it's been 8 months, she hasn't done anything. In the last month or so the anxiety has gotten worse and I feel a little resentful that she hadn't done anything when I asked, because I keep telling her I have a problem and I keep getting anxiety attacks. I don't want to resent her, I love her, but sometimes I can't help feeling the urge to blame her for everything. She's a forgetful person and I know I should ask again but it took me two and a half months to even find the courage to talk about it the first time and I still get so anxious just thinking about it that I just have so much doubt that I'll even do it at this point. I don't even know how I'd get through a dentist visit, I feel like I'd actually have to be put unconscious or something. I feel like I should have done things different and then none of this would be happening. I almost feel like it's ruined my life because I don't know if there's ever been a single day that has gone by where I don't think about this and just feel hopeless. It gets hard to keep telling them I need help and they do nothing. All this to say that I'd appreciate any kind of encouragement or whatever positivity/advice anybody has to throw my way because I don't really have friends to talk to about this and I really need it right now.

I stopped because my parents found out and I couldn\u2019t bare to see them see more fresh scars so I stopped out of fear and then I\u2019ve not touched a blade in that way, minus the brief period of relapse shortly after without visible scars on my leg. I\u2019m scared, because usually when I\u2019ve had thoughts of c//tting myself they\u2019ve been momentary, I know they\u2019ll pass, just the urge gets strong. Except the urge isn\u2019t strong right now in this period of time, it\u2019s come up a few times right before panic attacks but the planning, the made up scenarios of what would happen if I do do it have happened. Like intrusive thoughts except\u2026 I lean into them. It\u2019s like I\u2019m mentally preparing myself to get worse and need this tool again. Because the truth is, my mental health is shit again, the shittiest it has been since school, I opened up something inside of me and suddenly all this repressed anxiety has just made its way to the top and I don\u2019t know what to do except actually deal with it because I can\u2019t suppress it again, I want to get better. I\u2019m receiving therapy so I CAN get better. People at my work know about my anxiety right now, I\u2019ve been trying to tell as many people as I can about my mental health so that they can support me so that it\u2019s easier to look after myself. Even the store manager knows right now (she\u2019s been super supportive and I really trust her). But fuck can they find out about these thoughts. There\u2019s only one person I\u2019d potentially trust with this information because she\u2019s young but old enough that she\u2019s more recovered from her anxiety, but I don\u2019t want to worry her with this information and she is a supervisor despite the fact she\u2019s very friendly with me and I worry that even mentioning something like this to her she\u2019d have the duty to report it. I worry people will think I\u2019m a danger to myself but right now I\u2019m not, that\u2019s the thing, I\u2019m just growing increasingly worried that it\u2019ll only be a matter of time until I will be. How much anxiety and pain and suffering do I have to endure again to feel like I need to relapse to cope? Because everything is getting more serious, what was just more panic attacks and more anxiety has mentally drained me over the past few weeks and made me more actively process the trauma I\u2019ve been through because ultimately, that is the root reason as to why I\u2019m doing this shit right now. I\u2019m scared though. I keep saying these are just thoughts and it doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019ll do anything but I have a blade in my bag. It\u2019s from my past job, a box cutter, I need to get rid of it but idk how and where. And this is so stupid of me but I just picked it up and looked at it and I pressed my finger on the blade part and then really pressed down just to see how easily it COULD cut, and yes it\u2019s very blunt but I figured with enough force and pressure it could do harm. I don\u2019t know why I did it, I didn\u2019t draw blood on my finger cause it wasn\u2019t the attempt of self harm it was just seeing how easy or hard it would be to use and now I feel like an idiot and more of a danger to myself than I was because why would I absent mindedly do something like that? If I do that with barely any thought then what\u2019s stopping me from making the first mark again? Then what? My partner doesn\u2019t even know I\u2019ve had these thoughts and considerations, they\u2019ve heard when I\u2019ve had urges but nothing this serious because they know about my anxiety and if they know I\u2019ve had these thoughts it\u2019ll break them. I\u2019m seeing them tomorrow and staying over theirs for a few nights and I don\u2019t know what to do because what if I have these thoughts there?

I've been on a 'cocktail' of medications for around 13 years that seems to work great with my specific treatment. Over the years, under my Drs supervision, I've played around with the times I take them - AM/PM - obviously, I am not talking about medications with time related specifications. I take Lithium, Lamictal, and Seroquel XR to address Bipolar and Vyvanse for ADHD. The dosage has been tweaked over the years as needed. Initially, I took the Lithium and Lamictal in the AM and the Seroquel XR in the PM which, for me, was obvious since its sedating effects were the only thing allowing me to sleep. Along with the obvious Vyvanse in the AM. In the past few years I've made some adjustments: I started taking the Lithium in the PM with my Seroquel XR and keeping the Lamictal in the AM. My reasoning was two-fold: 1) the Lithium - while extremely effective - seemed to cause mild 'brain fog' and lethargy. 2) Due to the fact that Lithium is hard on the kidneys my Dr suggested taking it in the PM to lesson the strain put on them by also having to work through the digestion of the other stuff your consuming during the day. Which would also potentially address issue #1 - and it seemed to do so. In the last year I also switched to taking the Lamictal in the PM - which, from what I've read and have heard from other people on it, is common and the 'typical' suggested time anyhow. For me, I think the main reason for transitioning to PM was pure practicality - take them all at one time. I have been EXTREMELY fortuante and, even though I've been on these meds for years, have experienced little to no negative side effects. What times do you take your meds?

I had some minor dissosciative hallucinations also but i feel now this was because of anxiety cause by the drug than the drug itself. T the next day i felt a bit anxious after waking up but then felt fine until 2 days later when i had a fair amount of vodka on valentines day w my gf. This brought up heart palpatations and fear of heart attack but this time didnt go away i let it rest for a few days while i was home fro reading week but while varying in intensity didnt really go and scared me eventually i went to the hospital after a feeling of not being able to go to sleep and they ran tests on my heart which turned out to be completely fine.

I\u2019m 18 for context and I have no history of depression, just some anxiety that peaks when I have a presentation, on a daily basis it\u2019s obviously still there but manageable. So what exactly could Zoloft do for me? I hate the idea of taking drugs, even if it\u2019s just prescription medicine. I do get anxious when interacting with new people, in new situations and sometimes I shake a little, could Zoloft really get rid of all of this? or should I just continue trying exposure therapy? I felt that exposure therapy has helped me improve a little bit, but I\u2019m still on the fence about giving Zoloft a shot since I know it takes quite a while for it to actually start working.

Now, thankfully through therapy my therapist and I have developed non-pharmacological ways to help me go to sleep on rough nights, but the Xanax is a great emergency button on the few nights where nothing else works. I end up taking 2mg maybe 2-4 times a month. It works great for what it's supposed to do, it makes me sleepy and calms my mind and body and I get a great night of sleep after. What I immediately noticed though is that alongside those wonderful effects, my body also gets really heavy and uncoordinated and I start stumbling around like I'm drunk which normally is fine because I'm only ever taking it right before bed but my biggest continued issue is that the next day and for the following 24 hours the mental sedative effects have totally cleared but my body is still super uncoordinated and heavy feeling. It's gotten to the point where I am really hesitant to take the medication even when I need it because that heavy uncoordinated feeling is really disruptive to my day the next day and it doesn't look or feel great when I'm trying to go around town and get things done while looking like I've been getting blasted on morning mimosas. My questions are as follows: 1. Has anyone else dealt with this before? 2. Is my dose just too high? I'm a bigger girl and the 0.25 and the 0.5mg doses did absolutely nothing for my acute anxiety so my psych suggested to go for something more heavy duty 3.

Hi there. I'm a 30-year-old man and was diagnosed with Major Depression and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. I hospitalized myself back in December for suicidal thoughts and had the flu at the time. They put me on Latuda and Sertraline and told me it was Bipolar 2. I feel whatever for the next 2 months. Got 2 therapists surprisingly, one for EMDR and one for CBT, a psychiatrist (after cycling through 3), and waiting for a peer support program. I switched from 60mg of Prozac to 50 mg of Sertraline and 20 mg of Latuda in the hospital back in December, and the first month and a half of that made me feel less anxious about everything, but the depression was definitely still there, along with some intrusive thoughts every now and then. 2 weeks ago, my psychiatrist outside the hospital told me I most likely am dealing with just Major Depression and took me off of the Latuda and upped my Sertraline to 100 mg. She said if I'm not feeling better by this coming Thursday, up it again to 150mg. When I stopped the Latuda, the first 2 days I felt fine. The next 2 days I slept over 30 hours total. Then the next 6 days leading up to now have been insanely bad for me.

Thought I was going to need to go back to the hospital because suicidal thoughts came up again, but after crying I felt a little better. Wednesday: I woke up feeling really crappy and intrusive thoughts were really bad (mornings have been the worst part of the day for me this week). Felt a little better later on. Thursday: I think this day was the day I started to not feel like myself. I feel like I've changed somehow, or maybe I'm starting to dissociate. I'm not completely sure, but the mental gymnastics and rumination start here. Friday: The feeling intensifies, and I just have intrusive thoughts questioning everything I've done, am doing, and will do. I start to feel like I've lost my morals and values and am just a blank canvas waiting to be painted evil and paranoid by my intrusive thoughts. Saturday (Today): I wake up from a dream where I felt no emotions from all the craziness happening around me. Almost all day I've felt like I've become, or am becoming, a changed person and don't hold any of the values I used to have.

During my recent visit to my psychiatrist, I shared that I\u2019ve been struggling with a complete lack of drive or passion to excel, succeed, or even engage in activities I used to enjoy. He mentioned that I might be experiencing something called **amotivational syndrome** (I think that\u2019s what he called it\u2014please correct me if I\u2019m wrong). He explained that this could be due to one of three reasons: 1. Drug use (I\u2019ve been clean for over a year, so this likely isn\u2019t the cause). 2. Depression (I don\u2019t feel depressed, so this seems unlikely). 3. An after-effect of the psychosis I experienced.

After about two to three weeks of this I was pulled from the public school system, and later enrolled in an online public school a town over. Things settled down, I started medication and moved on with my life. Graduated high school and moved out of state when I was 18 with my then boyfriend. We got married and had two kids. I have stayed home with them since. My oldest is now seven and I started contract work about two to three weeks ago. At first the anxiety and panic attacks were less common, but still happened. I could find a way to calm myself and settle into the new normal of my job. But the last couple days? It feels like I\u2019m stuck. My anxiety is filling me with panic, fear and dread. Then feeding my depression that I\u2019m alone and I can fight or I can cave and let the world gobble me up. I had a panic attack two nights ago before bed. Dread from work and the inevitable of having I go to work. Then I woke up crying and shaking. Called in sick. Same routine for the last three days.

English is not my lative language so i will do my best to be as comprehensive as possible. A few months ago, I was diagnosed with ADHD and therefore received treatment, Ritalin for those who know what that is. But I quickly stopped because I noticed it was causing me anxiety attacks, particularly a racing heart, difficulty breathing, the feeling that I was going to die any minute. For 2 months after stopping the treatement everything was fine, but on the day of my departure for my vacation, I started having the same anxiety or panic attack for no reason at the boarding gate, probably because I was frustrated that the boarding was delayed. I attributed it to the impressive amount of caffeine I was consuming throughout the day, as a large dose of caffeine ironically does me good. So I have reduced my caffeine intake, going from maybe 7 or 8 coffees (double espresso) to just 1 coffee in the morning when I wake up. Everything was getting better and last night all of a sudden I felt a wave of anxiety wash over me, with a feeling of imminent death, it was extremely unpleasant, the only common factor I found is my coffee consumption, the act of dipping my lips in caffeine triggers waves of anxiety that can last all day, this morning for example I didn't consume caffeine and I feel very good and serene. I am aware that this site is not a medical office, and I have actually made an appointment with a doctor for a checkup upon my return from vacation, but are there any people who have had the same experiences as me? I have the impression that my problem is entirely psychological, especially because before taking Ritalin, I had to undergo an ECG and a blood test, and my heart is in very good condition. Moreover, when I exercise, my heart doesn't give me any problems; on the contrary, I feel a sense of well-being, and if there were an issue with my heart, I doubt I would be able to regain my composure and calm down.

My car was totaled. I've been diagnosed with GAD and have had a few pretty bad panic attacks in my life. Last night I was driving from my old apartment to my first house I just bought with the last load of my house plants (I had about 35 in the car, it's a hobby of mine). For some reason I'm still unsure of, I started having a panic attack. My heart rate went up, the pit of my stomach dropped, I felt woozy, broke out in cold sweat, and felt extremely anxious. Right before going onto the highway, I pulled to the side off the road with my hazards on to give myself time to come down off of this panic attack. I called my partner, who was at the house, and told him I was having a panic attack and he worked with me to help me get grounded and calm. I ended the call after about 8 minutes and told him I would call him back when I felt good to drive again. The intensity of the attack was coming in waves at this point, but it was gradually lessening. Less than 2 minutes after the call ended, someone rammed full speed into the back of my car. My car was lurched forward with an awful crunch, plant dirt and debris flew every where, I was thrown forward but my seat belt caught me. I was OFF the road to the side with my hazards on, this guy had to have somehow swerved and not seen my car to have hit me. I had no immediate injuries, but I was terrified. I've never heard myself scream like that. The panic attack I had almost gotten under control was now replaced with absolute mayhem of fear and pure adrenaline. The guy came out of his car and approached mine, I was already on the phone with police. He kept trying to give me his license and saying he was going to give me his insurance info. I was sobbing and telling him to wait I'm on the phone with the police. He handed me his license, so I took a picture of it while trying to describe to the location to the 911 operator. He took his license and drove off without getting his insurance. He spoke not great English and I think he was terrified and didn't know what to do. The police came with an ambulance. They took my vitals. I had no pain in my neck, back, stomach, or any where. I told the police what happened and showed them the pic of this guy's license. They were like \"WTF this guy gave you his license but not his insurance and drove off?\" That is a hit and run felony. I think the guy was trying to do the right thing but got scared and fled. The police caught him in about 30 mins. Turns out a car with a lot of front damage can't get very far. My car was totaled, the back wheel was completely torn off and the back axel was twisted beyond repair. Many of my house plant's pots had shattered immediately. I had to leave half of them in the car as it got taken to an impound lot because there wasn't enough room in my friend's car who came and picked me up. I loved this car so much, it saved my fucking life. I was beside myself seeing it being towed away, broken beyond repair, with some of my beautiful house plants still in it. I am fully covered for by insurance so they will be paying me out for the value of my car. I will be able to go to the impound lot to get the remainder of my plants and belongings. What just strikes me as so fucking cruel was that I had a panic attack and chose to safely move off the road to not put myself or other drivers in danger, and I still got hit and my car was totaled. I'm so grateful to still be alive and not in tjr hospital. But I'm scared about what this means for me and my anxiety moving forward. Will I have PTSD from this?

It is more than just having a \" phobia \" . It is really scary to go through . For some of us it's like being on a bad trip of LSD or weed 24/7 .

I walk for an hour at about 3.5 MPH (brisk pace) and lift weights for about 30/40 mins. Sometimes I\u2019ll skip lifting certain days if I\u2019m too sore or skip walking if my shins hurt too much and use that day to self care and R.I.C.E. to avoid injury. When I tell you I\u2019m a different person, I really am. Just after about a week and a half so much has changed. I haven\u2019t had a panic attack or anxiety for about a week. I became a hypochondriac and would worry about every little thing in my body. I have chronic pain so most bodily sensations are extremely exaggerated because my nerve sensitivity. Even when I have bowel movements they can be uncomfortable for painful when most people don\u2019t notice them. I\u2019ve really honestly ignored a lot of them. I can go through my day with my pain pretty much fine now. I\u2019m starting to get some of my natural humor and confidence back. Not much has really changed on the surface, but my mind has healed to what feels like years worth of therapy. I\u2019m planning on continuing this, and I would recommend you start if you haven\u2019t been already. Once you start working out you will enjoy it, as long as you ease into it and don\u2019t overwhelm yourself. You\u2019ll start to enjoy it and make goals. And the future will no longer be littered with fears and anxieties, but hope and motivation towards your goals. Best of luck to all of you! Edit: WOAH! I had no idea this was going to explode! Thank you everyone for the awards and your kind words. I wish everyone luck. I\u2019m sorry to anyone who said they\u2019re unable to workout for any reason. I highly suggest trying to contact a specialist (doctor/private trainer/psychologist/therapist etc.) to help you work through any limitations you\u2019re having. Everyone should have at least one thing they can escape to to help their anxiety. I do still get some anxiety working out but with time it\u2019s subsiding.

Hi everyone, I'm 24 years old, living in Germany, and I\u2019ve been struggling with severe depression and generalized anxiety disorder (diagnosed) for a long time. I have no contact with my family and live alone. Even though I meet up with friends regularly\u2014for example, going on nature walks\u2014I often still feel incredibly lonely. Communication is hard for me, and my mind constantly feels foggy, making it difficult to think, speak, or even write clearly. Physically, I experience symptoms like heart palpitations, dizziness while walking, tinnitus, muscle pain, tension, and twitching. My sleep is completely irregular, and I often feel extreme exhaustion. Some days, I don\u2019t eat properly and just scroll on my phone for hours, like when i wake up i'm on IG and scrolling for almost 1-2 hours before i actually wake up. I struggle with keeping up with daily tasks, and appointments stress me out so much that I often avoid them. I started outpatient therapy, but I was told that it likely wouldn\u2019t be effective for me. Since then, I\u2019ve barely seen a doctor because I\u2019m terrified of being diagnosed with something serious. I\u2019ve always had a strong tendency toward hypochondria, and I constantly worry about my health. At the same time, I also experience existential fears\u2014financial struggles, feeling stuck in life, and an overwhelming fear of the future. Some days, I think about death as a relief, even though I don\u2019t actually want to die, i'm actually scared to die. After my last real relationship ended (2years ago), my mental health declined a lot. I started smoking heavily (14-15 cigarettes a day, sometimes even more) and drinking regularly on weekends with friends and going to parties. I don't do that anymore regularly, instead we meet for hiking, but I still feel like I\u2019m just stuck in a cycle\u2014spending five days at home doing nothing but being on the PC sometimes playing the piano and gaming with friends, feeling overwhelmed by even the smallest tasks, and being afraid to go outside alone. I know I need to change something, but I feel like my body is made of lead, and everything is just too overwhelming. I often have disturbing dreams, feel emotionally unstable, and struggle with feelings of anger, frustration, and worthlessness. I worry a lot about what others think of me and fear that people notice how bad I actually feel. I guess I just need to hear from someone who understands. Are there others here who feel the same way? Or has anyone been in a similar situation and found a way to cope? I don\u2019t need criticism\u2014I already know I\u2019m struggling. I just want to feel less alone in this.

Content Note: symptom description Hi everyone. I just joined Reddit because I feel like I have to get this off my chest. I have the most supportive family and they understand as good as they can but you all **get** it. I've been diagnosed with social phobia/anxiety/depressive mood when i was 15 (am 33 now). The worst part about my anxiety is that I'm like 5% resilient. Which gets me to the actual point. I usually make appointments (doctors etc) as early in the day as possible because then I have it behind me and can 'enjoy' the rest of the day lol. Though I'm like 2 days pre-anxious about any appointment and it ruins those two days. Anyways. I needed to get a fresh haircut, called my hairdresser, and got a spontaneous spot in the afternoon. It was a disaster. Not the hair (love it, and my hairdresser is the sweetest) but everything else. First, it was really warm outside. I have very light skin and warmth (inside or outside) always makes my face glow, especially the cheeks. Additionally I get these hectic (?) spots in random areas on my face, forehead, and neck. I'm leaving the car. There was a skateboarder and I literally thought it's the loudest thing I ever heard. Plus, friday afternoon a lot of people are out and about and at that point it became too much. I had no idea where to go, walked into the wrong direction until my dad pointed me in the right one. At the hair salon I sat there, looking in the mirror, and I saw that my face turned into a blood moon. Everything red except the area around my mouth which made me look like I just drank milk lol. Back at home I was ***exhausted*** and noticed the first symptoms (headache, a bit nauseous). Yesterday was peak zero. I felt that butterfly-sensation in my stomach, like creeping panic, and just had all the symptoms (nausea, dizziness, lightheadedness, weird eye thing) and went to bed very early. There I just cried relentlessly. Until I got tired and fell asleep. I slept 14 hours straight and am now back at ca 50%. What made me cry the most though were all the memories of the time when I was still healthy. My pre anxiety life. I miss my old self. I was shy, but never that introverted. Though I'm very grateful for my life and I even like myself nowadays, but I can't stop comparing myself to \"normal\" people. Those who have a job (I'm currently on disability), and go somewhere fun. Football (soccer) stadiums or concerts for example. I realised that I might never go to a concert because the loudness would blow my brain out. Then again, I think that I don't have to do what others do. That it's perfectly ok to go my own way. Instead of concerts I might just go to the planetarium. I also know that I have good days, not so good days, bad days, and excellent days. Just because friday was a fiasco doesn't mean that all future days have to be... right? It's just that right now in this moment I can't even imagine feeling better although I rationally know that it's not gonna be like this forever. I think I'm just scared that one day I'll never recover from a situation like this. Then again we're all stronger than we think we are. I feel like I'm all over the place.

So like 6 months ago I was in a nail salon, everything was fine, I was in a good mood, and suddenly I felt like a weird \"rush\", kind of a wave from my head to my legs while sitting, and then extremely fast heart beat for couple of minutes. I called ambulance and had very high blood pressure but EKG was fine. Maybe it was arrythmia, I don't know. Took a while to get over it but I kind of did. Now, ten days ago I was running, again everything was fine, beautiful day, and I slow down the run, start walking and all of a sudden I feel extremely dizzy, and fast heart beat again. I had to sit down in the park. It again calmed down but after this I have been extremely scared, anxious ... Two days ago I was in front of laptop, sitting at home, and out of the blue I started feeling dizzy, world spinning. I went to lay down and it just was getting worse, I was super scared, I felt I was high on something (but not in a good way) and the heart rate was over 100. I called an ambulance, I started getting very cold, trembling, spinning feeling in the head. Ambulance came, everything was fine, it started to go better after. My partner gave me a mild xanax and after this I was almost normal but shaken. I tend to get these dizziness rushes daily now, and again just now I got dizziness feeling, my chest feels heavy, a bit heavy to breathe, hands feel heavy and I feel I am not completely in this universe, like just a weird feeling. Head is heavy. Heart beat is fine. I did some anxiety breathing exercise and just try to tell myself everything is fine and I won't die but I don't like the progression of these symptoms. Sorry if this message was messy explanation but I hope to find some support. Do you experience similar symptoms ? What do you do to stop them or just wait for it to go away ?

I was at a coffee shop and felt my inner alarm going off, no real reason I could think of. Felt the panic rising. I get hot, sweaty, bad stomach, light headed, spiked heartrate. (One of my worst fears when things like this happen is that I will shit my pants) Was plotting my escape, the bathroom or run to my car and leave. Felt trapped, overwhelmed, that everyone knew I was freaking out inside. I was able to focus on my breathing, recognizing the intrusive thoughts, grounding in my body, trying to be compassionate towards myself...And the feelings started to ease off, slowly deescalating. I recently had been feeling better and doing a lot of things that a few years prior didn't feel possible with my level of anxiety. After this episode passed my reaction was to be pretty bummed. Like I had regressed and moved backwards. But I know the goal isn't to make it go away completely but be able to move through it. And the small success of that is worth celebrating. I stayed at the Cafe, I wanted to prove to myself I was safe, that it was my head tricking me. All that is to say that I see you all, anxiety is horrible, it robs you of your identity, personality, of enjoying life. And it sucks feeling like you're constantly fighting yourself. I've been working on it, been in therapy for years and the progress can feel excruciatingly slow. But it's possible to move through, to manage.

I had to go home since I was so worried that I was gonna throw up, I felt immediately better when I got home and when to the gym the next day. but over the coming weeks, I started to feel that I'm losing appetite more and more, I would feel my knees getting weaker, shortness of breath, chest tightness, loss of strength and energy, all these were happening at the same time but I didn't care and went on with my life. 3 months later college started again, and immediately on the first day I had a panic attack, a week went by and my anxiety went up so high that nothing entered my stomach for almost 2 days except a couple of glasses of water. I went to a gastroenterologist because I thought it's a stomach issue that i'm having and he did some tests only to find out that everything is in great condition, it was him that told me that I might have anxiety and should think less of my stomach and everything will be better on it's own. for the rest of the semester, i did keep getting better until one day I received a call and a really sad news made it all worse, eventually leading to me getting back to smoking cigarettes. so, it has been more than 2 years and I still have this problem, I don't know if this is long term anxiety? depression? eating disorder? or just some physical problem with my stomach that the doctor couldn't catch. I have lost interest in almost everything, back in the day I wanted to go out everyday, now I go out like 2 times a month and I don't even enjoy these 2 times. when someone asks for going out to eat I would just tell them that I already ate even if I hadn't ate anything for that day. I also lost interest in going to the gym since I don't have the energy to lift weights. before all this started, I was completely healthy, and nothing major happened in my life except that I went to jail in June 2022 but got out after 2 days when they found out I'm innocent. but now it feels like everything in my life was a mistake, I'm always thinking about things that happened like 8 years ago and worry that it might come up again, not to mention that my past mistakes always haunt me.

For a while every time I had an ache or pain it'd trigger a panic attack, and I've worked hard to calm that down. But I still occasionally cause myself a jolt of adrenaline when I'm unsure about a supplement I've taken, etc. For a split second I'll think I'm having trouble swallowing or can't breathe properly, and it'll trigger a big jolt of adrenaline, then I'll start to feel kinda spaced out.

I\u2019m due to go back in a week and just tested positive for covid. i feel like my life is literally over.

For some reason my anxiety rarely appears as conscious thoughts. I almost never actually think anxious thoughts, and most often my anxiety is just a vague, albeit potentially overwhelming feeling. Even worse, I often get just the physical symptoms of anxiety without feeling anxious at all. It's the most bizzare thing ever. I am not thinking about anything stressful or worrying while my throat feels like it's closing up and my lungs feel like I can't breathe. My conscious mind is completely calm but my body is in full fight or flight mode. I think it might be caused by some sort of instinctual emotional suppression, which is something I'm embarrasingly good at, as my default response to negative emotions is most often to squash them down, maybe dissociate and let them pass. This is why I get so freaked out when I get that \"wave of anxiety\" feeling when you feel like the whole world is closing in on you. I was wondering if anybody else experiences this?

So as a background on me, I am a 27 year old male, and I have had pretty bad anxiety issues my whole life, and many in my family have similar issues. This current bout of stress has gradually ruined my sleep and eating, and has caused me like 5 panic attacks a week for like 6 weeks, and some fun depersonalization/disassociation type of stuff, to be totally frank. I was already been under a lot of underlying stress up to this point also. I was hoping to share my experience to get some insight/hear similar stories from others, and maybe some peace of mind from the experience of others that steers me away from worrying that I am dying 24/7. (I do have doctor's appointments lined up also for the record, but I can't talk to my main doc til Monday). Also apologies in advance for how long and rambly this is gonna be; I am trying to paint a complete picture here. I will try to keep this updated as well. So here's the scoop. I have been very stressed the past few months especially. It started around the beginning of January when I noticed my left eye had poorer vision than my right eye (particularly at distances and not close up). I keep spending way too much time switching back and forth between my eyes just to make sure it was actually different, and eventually I thought about it less even though I realized my vison was poorer in my left eye. It was kinda hard to notice if I was using both my eyes, so like I eventually just went about my business, but it worries me that I don't know how long it was like that, or how quickly that developed. I also worry about if it is a part of my other symptoms. Going forward, the next month I had an incident that was very stress inducing and left me crying for awhile, and I got a headache around my right eye that just didn't seem to want to go away. It was there all night, and before bed it switched to my left eye, but when I woke up it was back in my right eye, and it was in that eye most of the time. Eventually I made an assumption that maybe all my screen time was the cause, so I avoided screens for days. Gradually my head got better, but not 100% better, and the length of the headache stressed me very badly because I have never had a headache last more than a day pretty much. It never went away fully despite feeling pretty alright for like 2 weeks generally speaking. And actually sometimes I felt like sinus burning (but no congestion), and also other times occasionally tooth pain ( I have some cavities I have been getting worked on since I had noticed tooth pains leading up to all this. Also I still have all my wisdom teeth, and sometimes I worry if my upper wisdom teeth which have not popped out could be having issues or something, but I had an x-ray sometime prior, and the dentist didn't seem to notice anything off I guess. So then it stayed at that baseline for the next couple weeks, and also sometimes in the middle of the night I'd wake up with the left side of my neck feeling sore, and also feeling a headache in the lower back of my head. This happened a handful of times, but not every time. I also started feeling occasional chest pains (which has happened for me in the past during high stress). I went to the doctor and told them about everything I was dealing with and they didn't seem too worried about the head stuff. They gave me a prescription for Prozac, sent me for bloodwork, and ordered a heart scan. The bloodwork came back fine except for a slightly low bun/creatinine ratio (8), I have yet to do the heart scan, and I haven't touched the Prozac yet because I have been too anxious to try it (plus also I wanted to be able to pay attention to my symptoms and not get side effects mixed up with my symptoms, or worsen my symptoms). I saw an eye doctor and he said my eyes were healthy, but that my left eye has slightly poor vision, and my right eye has astigmatism (OD: Plano spehere, -0.50 cylinder, axis 175. OS: -0.50 sphere, D.S cylinder.), and said I should get glasses to use as needed, but that my vision was mostly fine. A couple weeks ago now I started feeling a strange pressure at the top of my head that popped up pretty suddenly (feeling something like a vein maybe? it is hard to describe). It came on gradually over like a minute or so, and has been constant ever since I think, but sometimes when I wake up I feel like it might not be there until I start thinking about it, and also I sometimes forget about it when wearing my headset, or like a hat or something. For a few days it had felt like the pressure at the top of my head had a burning sort of sensation as well, but that has gone away since (it did also come back for a short while, but then went away again). Around the 14th and 15th I had a headache when I got up from bed, but one lasted like an hour and was the back and front of my head, and the other lasted a few hours. Lately I have been finding myself feeling nauseous on and off, and occasionally this like dizzy headsick feeling. Sometimes my head feels hot. And here and these I have felt momentary dull pains in my forehead near one eye or the other. Also the past couple days I have been feeling this sort of \"vertigo\" kind of thing where it feels like my surroundings are very slightly moving or shifting or something. The past couple days I have also felt this faint tingling sort of sensation down my left arm into my pinky. Last night I had gotten myself feeling mostly fine actually, but then I started feeling this weird sensation with my left eyelid where it sort of felt like it was kinda harder to blink very slightly. Like the eyelid skin was getting folded up in a funny way or something Idunno. Was still feeling the weird left arm/hand tingling thing too, and at also for a while last night my left ear was hurting a fair bit (like the ear itself, and not like inside). Yesterday I also thought that my vision overall felt as poor as my left eye for some reason, and I woke up feeling sick today. I tried playing an FPS game for an hour or so, and it felt off visually like the whole time, and then I got quite headsick feeling, but after I stopped playing that got a fair bit better. As I have been writing this I think it has lessened even more actually, and eventually got better. Though now (when I was writing this last night) the right side of my head hurts from like my eyebrow up to the front top of my head, but then as fast as I mention that it kinda chills out. My head does feel hot in this moment also, but I haven't checked my temp at all because I am afraid of seeing a high temperature and triggering another panic attack basically. Another important note for the past like week is my eyes keep feeling sore to the touch basically. Or like if I look around too much or something I will notice it. As of a little bit later also I noticed my left eye feeling sting-y feeling and being sorta watery and also looking red. More recently (like the past day) I have felt an on and off strange sinus pressure sort of dull headache, and had a slightly burning nose, and feeling like my head feels uncomfortably warm. I went to bed at a dumb time and woke up with the top back of my neck feeling achey. Same with my forehead too I guess. Anywho that's probably the entire story I think. I have just been freaking out about this daily, stressing myself into not eating good enough or sleeping good enough, and it's just been awful really. The head symptoms have been really mild though. The first week my head hurt quite a bit to the point where I was like taking tylenol and using an ice pack for a couple days, If I knew for a fact that I was fine and nothing was wrong with my head, then this would be totally managable, but my anxiety is off the charts and so I have been miserable. I just want to be fine again, but after 6 weeks it feels like this is just my life now until it gets worse, actually for real better, or until I get answers. My mom keeps telling me it's just stress and anxiety because she's had similar (often worse) stuff too, but it's hard to be logical when stuff feels so weird and constant. Short-ish version: Head issues for like 6 weeks straight. Vision changes a month prior, then mild lingering (changing) headache that started off bad but then mostly got better and now just comes and goes, top of head pressure (sometimes burning), slight vertigo/dizziness, headsick feeling that comes and goes, weird tingling in left arm/hand(left side of left hand), warm feeling head, sinus pressure and burning nose sometimes, eye soreness (strain?), neck pains in the night, and maybe some other stuff, over the course of 6 weeks, and it has had me stressing big time.", "1jgu6vc": "Benzo or propranolol for long-haul flight? Hey everyone I\u2019ve been dealing with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) for a while now, but through exposure and persistence, I\u2019ve managed to almost completely overcome it. What used to be a debilitating issue, at one point causing agoraphobia, has now become more of a manageable nuisance in daily life. That said, some situations still trigger intense anxiety for me, and one of the worst is flying. In less than a week, I\u2019ll be flying alone from Europe to the US. It\u2019s a long-haul flight, and I\u2019m already feeling extremely anxious. What\u2019s frustrating is that for the first 25 years of my life, I had zero issues with flying. This all started about a year ago, seemingly out of nowhere. Originally, my anxiety centered around the fear of \u201cgoing crazy.\u201d Over time, that\u2019s shifted into more generalized social fears, like the fear of embarrassing myself in public, passing out, hyperventilating, or losing control. While on airplanes it is however on a different level. I get intrusive \u201cwhat if\u201d thoughts like: \u2022 What if I freak out in front of everyone? Causing embarrassment and an unpleasant flight for everyone on board. \u2022 What if I go crazy and try to open the airplane door mid-flight? \u2022 What if I cause the plane to make an emergency landing because of a panic attack? Spoiling everyone\u2019s travel on board. \u2022 What if I become a danger to myself or others? It\u2019s not about the plane crashing, I\u2019m not typically scared of that. It\u2019s more the bizarre, surreal nature of being 30,000 feet in the air that triggers a sense of derealization and claustrophobia. Being \u201ctrapped\u201d for 9 hours without a clear escape makes everything worse. These thoughts then spiral into each other: the claustrophobia feeds the derealization, which makes me think I\u2019m losing my mind, which spikes my heart rate and creates a full panic loop. Even though I generally never actually leave a situation even at the onset of panic, I always power through, just knowing that I could leave helps a lot. But on a plane, that safety valve doesn\u2019t exist. That\u2019s what terrifies me. When this all began, my GP prescribed me benzos, but I\u2019ve never taken them. I\u2019ve always preferred to face things head-on through exposure. But now I\u2019m unsure. I\u2019ve read that benzos can help in the moment but might also cause derealization or a rebound in anxiety afterwards and worst case psychosis (my ultimate fear). I\u2019m also hesitant because of my past, between ages 20\u201323, I used marijuana heavily, almost daily. A year and a half after quitting, this anxiety hit me out of nowhere when I randomly out of nowhere experienced derealization for the first time without knowing what it was. That history makes me fearful of taking anything that alters my state of mind. I still carry a lingering fear of psychosis, even though I\u2019ve never had any signs of it. So here I am asking this nice community the following; Do I finally take a benzo just for the flight? Should I try something milder like propranolol? Or just grit my teeth and push through like I would do on ground? Or\u2026 should I get drunk before the flight (I know, not ideal, but I don\u2019t drink often either)? I\u2019m afraid that taking a benzo might make things worse by giving me rebound anxiety as well as derealization for days after during the trip itself, but I also don\u2019t know if I can mentally handle 9 hours in the air in a sensitized state, only to arrive in the US already burned out from the anxiety. Would love to hear from anyone who\u2019s been through something similar. What worked for you? \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 TL;DR: Flying triggers intense anxiety for me\u2014claustrophobia, derealization, and intrusive thoughts which raises my adrenaline and makes me ultimately panic. I have a 9-hour flight soon and I\u2019m torn between taking a benzo, asking for propranolol, drinking, or just powering through.

However, I have experienced something very interesting and I want to talk about it. This entire week has been absolutely crazy for me. I ended up landing in the ER once. I experienced symptoms including but not limited to: * shortness of breath when standing up * chest pain * dizziness * headaches * sweaty palms / feet * loss of apetite * frequent urination * etc All of these were kicked off because I noticed shortness of breath over the weekend. Then I got anxious, anxiety produced more symptoms, and I read into those symptoms too much. Then I I went to the ER scared of a heart attack, but everything was fine. In fact doctors said everything is perfect, and it looks like I just had bad anxiety. A few days pass, most symptoms went away since I stopped reading into them and started ignoring them. One symptom however remained: the one that started it all I can't beat this subjective feeling of shortness of breath. This kicks in more anxiety, etc. Then browsing some Reddit posts, I saw a link to a study that showed even a slight anterior pelvic tilt can cause difficulty catching one's breath. I was so anxious about it and it not going away, that I was not sure what was wrong with me and started getting really scared.

Since then it's caused a ton of health anxiety and ptsd which I'm in weekly therapy for. We've been doing exposure therapy where I take my bp with him which helped a lot and will hopefully help me get over my fear of getting my bp taken. I use to see my doctor every 2-4 weeks for bp check ups and medication adjustments but the past 2 I've had, my bp was good so he said to monitor at home from now on. Which I hadn't been able to do since yesterday because my anxiety spikes every time I get it taken. Therapy went well and my bp kept fluctuating between 127/80s and 90s to 150/90 which was the highest it got but then went back down to the 120s. Then I got the courage to take it at home and and it was 110/89 and I felt really happy cuz that's the lowest the top number has been in so long. My usual is in the 120s. Even though my bottom number was a little high, it still made me feel relieved. Then today I got the courage to take it a few times. The first reading I got was great. 127/80. Then I took it a few more times and it just kept going up from there because I was getting more anxious. The last reading I got was 147/76. Bottom number is good but top number was high. This caused me to have a panic attack and I couldn't calm down and I just kept spiraling. I couldn't calm down enough to mediate and do mindfulness so I immediately took a cold shower which seemed to do the calm me down. But now every time I'm anxious, I can't help but think about how high my bp might be. If anyone has any advice or words of encouragement, I'd really appreciate it.

It was early afternoon and I had summoned an Uber driver from my home to take me to a friends house to watch some basketball about 25-30 minutes away. He arrives, greetings were fine, asked me how my day was, standard stuff. Not much talking between us, and honestly I don't mind. Car was clean as well! &#x200B; About 20 minutes into our drive I notice he's sort of glancing in the rearview at me like he wants to say something, he starts kind of breathing deep breaths and says: \"Sorry I have to pull over.\" I reply: \"Ok is everything alright?.\" He says \"Sorry having a panic attack.\" I remained calm and told him, \"Ok that's fine man, I have panic attacks too, I'm not going anywhere important, take your time.\" Luckily he was able to pullover, we were in a residential area with a hill next to us and side walk. He wasn't really speaking much at this point and I told him: \"I know when I have these attacks I like to be alone, don't worry I'm not in a hurry, I'll be over here on the curb playing games on my phone take your time, let me know if you want to call anyone.\" &#x200B; About 20-30 minutes later, I told him I could drive him the rest of the way so he could finish his trip and make money, he said to give him a few more minutes. He was able to calm down enough to drive us. We arrived fine, I tipped him told him this is my number if he needs to talk with someone with anxiety as well and went on our ways.

I\u2019ve had panic attacks where the adrenaline rushes just don\u2019t stop, I\u2019ve been nauseated and unable to eat or drink for days on end, I\u2019ve felt so short of breath it was like drowning above water, had the jitters and the lump in my throat. I\u2019ve also had all of the uncomfortable mental symptoms. I\u2019ve dissociated for almost a full day multiple times, I\u2019ve had racing, intrusive thoughts that lasted weeks and sometimes months at a time. And I\u2019ve felt like I was going crazy. A lot. But I\u2019m here to tell you my struggle with my anxiety disorder is over. After almost a year of conscious and concerted effort, all of the worst symptoms of my anxiety are completely gone. Some of the more mild ones still appear from time to time; I\u2019ll get fatigued or dizzy/foggy maybe once every few weeks, but this happens so infrequently (and becomes less frequent with each occurrence) that it doesn\u2019t really bug me. I was also on medication (an SSRI since day one and a benzo for the first few months) and am in the process of tapering off . So I wanted to write a post about how to get over each stage of your anxiety, mainly because I know I really would have appreciated this kind of guidance when I first sought help in late April of last year. If you want a summary of things you can do regardless of what stage you\u2019re at, scroll to the bottom and check the paragraph in bold. I don\u2019t discuss responses to specific symptoms here, just a general approach. If you\u2019re looking for tactics for specific symptoms, check out the list of books I left in the second section. I think the first one does a particularly good job of addressing every symptom, but you can try the third if you don\u2019t feel it makes enough of a difference. Before you read, I want to mention something once so I don\u2019t have to later on. Recovery is going to be like a rollercoaster. Some days you\u2019ll feel like you made incredible progress, and others you\u2019ll have difficulty even doing simple tasks. It\u2019s going to be a lot of two steps forward, one step back. Sometimes it\u2019ll even be two steps forward, two steps back. But even those times are okay, because they serve as proof that you are capable of improving. Just know that once you start to give effort, things will start gradually getting better. So here it is. My comprehensive guide to recovering from an anxiety disorder. If you\u2019re at a constant 9/10 - 10/10 anxiety and can\u2019t calm down: At this stage, you\u2019re either in the middle of panic attack (which lasts up to 60 minutes) or you have GAD and are constantly anxious. I was diagnosed with GAD and Pure-O but I\u2019ve had maaaaaany panic attacks, so I know this advice will work for both. **1.** Stop trying to fight your anxiety symptoms. Understand that the best thing you can do for your body right now is just let it run its course. This is the basis of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) which is one of the types of therapy currently used to treat anxiety disorders. To do this: * Don\u2019t try to stop any symptoms you are experiencing. This is infinitely easier said than done at first, but with practice you\u2019ll be able to pick this up fairly quickly. When I was first having constant adrenaline rushes, I kept trying to consciously stop them. This was actually making things worse. The more you try to fight your symptoms, the more worried you become, which in turn causes your system to release more of the stress-causing hormones, causing your symptoms to become worse. The best thing you can do at this point is wait it out and let your body tire itself out. * Questions, doubts, and fear will come up. When they do, remind yourself that this is a totally normal process that your body is going through, and try to rest in the anxiety. It may be difficult, but try to ease into the symptoms. This was initially what helped my adrenaline rushes decrease in severity and frequency. * If this isn\u2019t working and you find your symptoms are still persisting and won\u2019t stop, ask for more. As the DARE Response (discussed later) puts it, run towards your symptoms. If you\u2019ve ever read a book on ACT, this step is likely in there. When you ask your body to make your symptoms worse, you\u2019ll find it can\u2019t. The symptoms of anxiety are driven by a subconscious worry, and not something you can control. Keep running towards it until your symptoms gradually begin to ease, then move on to step 2. In case you\u2019re interested, the clinical term for this is \u201carousal reappraisal.\u201d It\u2019s not discussed very often, but I found it to be very helpful. **2.** Do anything you possibly can to get your mind off of the anxiety. In older forms of anxiety treatment, this kind of thing was referred to as a distraction tactic, but in The DARE Response, Barry McDonagh calls it being \u201cengaged.\u201d This basically means do whatever you can to focus your mind on something other than your anxiety. Regardless of what level of anxiety you\u2019re at, this is incredibly important. **Your anxiety is most easily fueled when you focus on it, so do whatever you can to move your attention to something else.** Again, MUCH easier said than done, and your mind will fight you at every stage. But it\u2019s an integral part of recovery. When I first started out, I found short activities the most helpful, like picking up my guitar/cajon and playing a song or two, or doing homework. **3.** Give it time. Your system can\u2019t sustain anxiety levels this high for an extended period of time unless you consciously fuel it. If you are properly easing into your symptoms and engaging yourself in other activities you\u2019ll eventually calm down to the next phase of anxiety recovery. **4.** If recommended by your physician, a benzo might help. Benzos are basically nervous system relaxants, but they\u2019re no magic pill. When I took my first dose of valium, I didn\u2019t feel a thing. It took a few days of constant dosing to see any effect. Benzos are fine to use in the very beginning, but I will issue a warning about them: try to use them as sparingly as possible. Benzos are not meant to be used in the long term, and if the first thing you do when feeling anxious is reach for your benzo, you\u2019ll have real difficulty recovering in the later stages. But since at this point, you\u2019re in a constant state of panic, they\u2019re a great way to ease you down to the next lowest stage of anxiety, so you can start focusing on the long term. **5.** Journal. I don\u2019t recommend this as much beyond this stage, as I\u2019ve found it doesn\u2019t really help all that much. But in the beginning stages of my experience with GAD, I found journaling to be an indispensable asset to really figure out what I was going through. Just write out whatever you\u2019re thinking or feeling. It\u2019s a great what to get out of your head for at least a little bit. **6.** Get up and do something to release all your pent up adrenaline. Walk around the block, take a stretch break at work. You don\u2019t need to be doing a full workout at this point, just something to help you use the jitters and adrenaline you\u2019re getting for something productive. **7.** This one may seem rather minor, but it helped me a lot in the beginning: fix your posture. It\u2019s much easier to feel short of breath when you\u2019re in a position that doesn\u2019t let you breath easily. If you\u2019re lying down, lay on your back. If you\u2019re sitting, sit up straight. Once you\u2019ve thoroughly calmed down from this point (this took me about three or four weeks), you can move on to the next step. Constant 6 - 8/10 with occasional panic attacks: If you\u2019re at this phase, you are probably still experiencing physical manifestations of your anxiety, like jitters, nausea, jelly legs, shortness of breath, and so on. But you\u2019re not in constant freakout mode anymore. You can make logical decisions aimed more at long term recovery because rather than being focused on your anxiety 100% of the time, you pay attention to it 80 - 90% of the time. You may be leaving the house occasionally but your symptoms are still bad enough that they keep you at home most of the time. So here\u2019s what to do at this stage: **1. Start reading or listening to books on what you\u2019re going through**. The more you understand the subtleties of what\u2019s going on in your brain and body, the better you\u2019ll be able fix them. Read up on therapy techniques as they\u2019ll be your quickest route to recovery. In the end, this ended up being the single most helpful thing for my recovery. When you\u2019re knowledgeable of exactly what is at your disposal, you can try everything and see what works best for you. In fact, I found really helpful ideas in books that none of my therapists had even heard of. Like your anxiety, the list of books that will be the most helpful for you is very personalized, but here are my recommendations (all of these books are available on Audible, which is how I consumed them): * The DARE Response. Phenomenal book written by someone who\u2019s been through the worst parts of anxiety and paved his own path to recovery. His techniques are a combination between ACT and a little CBT. I would especially recommend this book if you\u2019re at the higher end of the anxiety scale. * Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy. This book is considered the gold standard of CBT. It\u2019s aimed at treating depression, but (as the author notes) it works for anxiety as well. I listened to the whole thing, then picked out the chapters I thought applied to me. It\u2019s long, so I don\u2019t think you need to do the first part, but there\u2019s a lot of valuable information in this book that a lot of other books skim over. * Rewire Your Anxious Brain. This one is 1/4 CBT, 1/4 lifestyle guidance, and half about the neuroscience behind anxiety. I like this one a lot because it gets into some of the mechanics of why we feel the way we do, and why therapy and lifestyle changes are so impactful. * The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck. This one has been mentioned on this subreddit several times before, and I really like it. It serves as a great reminder of why some things in life just aren\u2019t worth giving a fuck about. Fair warning: Mark Manson describes OCD as \u201can incurable disease\u201d in this book. He\u2019s not a doctor or therapist and isn\u2019t really knowledgeable on the subject, so I\u2019d take that section with a grain of salt. But the message he drives home at the end is really good regardless. Remember, the point of these books isn\u2019t to give you step by step instructions on how to get better. Rather they are there to give you ideas on how to best help yourself. **2.** Get into therapy. This is perhaps the second most important things you can do for yourself behind reading. Therapy is the first line of treatment for anxiety, and for good reason. Once you find a therapist who you work well with, you\u2019ll notice you progress much more quickly. Some things to look out for when you screen your therapist: * Are they nice? Kind of an obvious one but worth going over. Do you feel like they take what you\u2019re saying seriously? Are their answers usually thoughtful and caring? * Are they experienced? My first therapist was tremendously nice and caring, but he didn\u2019t know much about anxiety treatment beyond the very basics, like square breathing. * Are they accessible? Or do you have to drive two hours to see them? Are they available for weekly sessions or can you only see them once a month? It may take a while until you find a therapist who\u2019s right for you, but this is a person you\u2019ll be meeting with multiple times a month for several months/years. I would advise giving your therapist at least three or four sessions before you consider switching to a new one. **3.** Continue with all the acceptance techniques outlined in the previous section. These are things that I remind myself of even now. The more open you are towards your anxiety symptoms, the more quickly they\u2019ll dissipate. In addition, if you can, start easing off your benzo a little bit. If you\u2019re taking it three times a day, try to move down to two. If you\u2019re down to two a day, try one. **4.** Start making some lifestyle changes that are proven to help with anxiety in the long term: * Cardiovascular exercise. It\u2019s said that exercise is one of the most positive things to improve mood when you\u2019re anxious, but I\u2019d like to look at it from the opposite perspective. When you\u2019re anxious, your body is filled with excess adrenaline that keeps building up. If you don\u2019t dump it out somehow, the symptoms will inevitably get worse. So getting up from your desk or your bed is one of the most effective things you can do to help yourself in the long term. If you\u2019re not super exercise savvy, my suggestion is to get out and walk, jogging occasionally. Walking is great for releasing excess energy, but you can boost the speed at which you let off adrenaline by running. You don\u2019t need to do sprints whenever you run, but you\u2019ll get the most out of your exercise if you really challenge yourself each time. More on this later. * Meditation. The reason so many people say this is so good for anxiety is because it helps you better come to terms with your symptoms. It also lets you really hone in on some of the less productive thought processes you\u2019re having so you can learn to catch and correct them. Keep in mind, the purpose of meditation is not to clear your mind and think of nothing. In fact, it\u2019s almost the opposite. While meditating, your job is to let your body and brain work as normal and merely try to act as a conscious observer of all your thoughts and feelings. A really popular visualization technique for this is thinking of your thoughts as clouds, and you\u2019re just watching them pass by. There is plenty of information out there on how to meditate, and it includes helpful techniques like noting, so I won\u2019t go into it that much here. Make sure that your approach to meditation is similar to your approach to exercise: slowly ease into it by doing it for short periods at first, then working up very gradually to longer periods after every couple sessions. I suggest trying out the meditation app Calm. * Diet. If you\u2019re reading this, you\u2019ve probably read the do\u2019s and don\u2019ts of your diet about a hundred times, but I\u2019ll reiterate quickly here: no caffeine, no alcohol. Try your best to avoid excessive sweets and fried foods, and those are shown [1] to worsen your mood in the long term. One of the less known changes you can make to your diet is to include more natural sources of magnesium. It is speculated [2] that magnesium plays a part in anxiety regulation, though the research isn\u2019t entirely there yet. Regardless, try to include dark leafy greens like spinach and whole grains like brown rice into your diet to hit this as a staple. You can also take a magnesium supplement (I\u2019ll defer to the DARE Response for information about it), though again, research is shaky so this alone won\u2019t bring change. * Medication. This one will be completely at you/your doctor\u2019s discretion. Some people respond well to antidepressants, some don\u2019t. I didn\u2019t feel like they helped me all that much, but you might. Note, the purpose of antidepressants isn\u2019t to make you happy or to gradually cure your anxiety. Research shows [3] that antidepressants are useful for supplementing long term change in the brain. This is a REALLY important thing to note because it means that antidepressants won\u2019t change anything on their own. Only if you give conscious effort will you be able to see positive change. Medication only makes it happen more quickly. **5.** Give it time. Your nervous system doesn\u2019t change overnight. It may need a week or two more before you achieve the results you want. So just keep practicing your therapy techniques and doing everything you know works and push through. Once you\u2019ve been at these things for a while, you\u2019ll notice your anxiety start to decrease to the next phase. Hovering around 4 - 6: If you\u2019re at this stage, congratulations! The first two stages are really hard to break out of, and if you did, it likely took a tremendous amount of effort. So give yourself a pat on the back. Once you\u2019ve reached this stage, your anxiety likely doesn\u2019t manifest itself physically as much. You may still get nauseated occasionally, but most of the time you\u2019re able to eat and drink and (hopefully) sleep through the night. You\u2019ve started reclaiming your normal life. You get out of the house relatively frequently and do things like run errands. But you\u2019re still really anxious whenever you go out. In addition, though your physical symptoms may have eased up, your mental symptoms may still be incredibly difficult to deal with. So here\u2019s what you should do at this stage: **1.** Keep staying the course. It\u2019s easy to flounder or stop, and it\u2019s okay if you do. But remember to pick up right where you left off. Also, don\u2019t beat yourself up for making mistakes. Everyone falters from time to time, it\u2019s part of what makes us human. And it\u2019s okay if things are taking longer than you expected. Take it from me that if you keep looking for ways you can improve your anxiety and practicing the techniques you know work, things will get better. **2.** Keep pushing the envelope. Identify areas of your life that you\u2019ve always been anxious about and challenge yourself to use therapy techniques to improve them. I used to beat myself up for being awkward ever since I was a little kid. I\u2019d find flaws in every interaction I had with others and nitpick every little thing. Once I started working on this, I noticed not only an improvement in these kinds of situations, but also an improvement in my overall anxiety. This is part of how Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) therapy works. You expose yourself to situations that make your anxiety flare up, and use CBT techniques to curb your conscious worry. An important note about this is **these experiences aren\u2019t meant to be fun**. If you\u2019ve got social anxiety and you\u2019re challenging yourself by going to meet new people, it\u2019ll likely be an uncomfortable experience the first few times. People around you may be having plenty of fun while you keep worrying and criticizing yourself. But you\u2019ll slowly notice improvement, and with time, it\u2019ll become more and more natural over time. **3.** Along the same lines, start making your workouts more difficult. Run/bike/swim for longer, lift heavier weights. When you\u2019re anxious, you tend to stagnate in certain areas of your life, sometimes without realizing it. The only way to get better is to keep pushing the bounds of what you do. I saw a post on this subreddit a while ago along the lines of \u201cI\u2019ve been lightly jogging for 25 minutes a day for the last month or two, why aren\u2019t I seeing my anxiety improve?\u201d And the answer in this case is because this person wasn\u2019t pushing him/herself. If you continue to do the same things, you shouldn\u2019t expect to see improvement. **4.** Start identifying and cutting off some of your crutches/unhealthy habits. For a lot of us (me included), this comes in the form of googling symptoms or constantly asking for help on this subreddit. It\u2019s okay to cave every once in a while at this stage, but you need to consciously stop yourself from constantly asking for help on the internet. One of the things this does is keep you focused on your anxiety, which is exactly what engaging yourself is meant to prevent. I stopped browsing this subreddit for almost a half year, and my condition got much better as a result. If you\u2019re seriously concerned about something, visit your doctor/psychiatrist/therapist and ask them, but once they diagnose you, do not second guess it. I spent my entire college career going to different doctors (I think at least 10 or 11 different types, sometimes multiple doctors of each kind). I was convinced there was something wrong with me that no one could find, but the true culprit was anxiety. If you **feel** like you\u2019re constantly sick or dying, yet doctors can\u2019t find anything wrong, this is a clue that you have an issue with being a hypochondriac. You can go about fixing this the way you did in all areas of your therapy (I personally used the CBT method outlined in Feeling Good), but the important thing is to recognize that just because your brain is telling you something doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s true. **5.** Give it time. I\u2019ve said it before but it\u2019s important to reiterate. Recovering from this stage might take several months, so try your best to be patient. And remember, if things aren\u2019t the way you want them to be now, they will be soon. I think it\u2019s also important to discuss the idea of **cognitive fusion**, which you may have come across in your book reading, as I think understanding it will be really helpful. Google defines cognitive fusion as attaching a thought to an experience, but since that\u2019s kind of vague, I\u2019ll give my own definition. Cognitive fusion is when you take what your thoughts tell you as fact. In other words, you\u2019re using your thoughts to draw irrational conclusions about the world around you. One example of this is if you\u2019re someone who criticizes themselves too much. You might tell yourself \u201cthat conversation was so awkward, so that person must think I\u2019m a loser.\u201d In this case, whether or not the situation was awkward, you don\u2019t know what the other person is thinking. I used to think this a lot until I realized people really didn\u2019t see me that way, and all the worrying I did was for nothing. A healthy level of questioning can do lots to help you overcome your anxiety. At this stage, I had the most trouble with mental symptoms, namely the feeling of going crazy. I thought the little floaters in my eyes were hallucinations, I always second guessed my own sanity, I thought the weird dreams or intrusive thoughts I was having were a sign of schizophrenia, and anytime I was happy, I thought it was a sign of bipolar disorder. This is another great example of cognitive fusion that took me a while to get over: I thought I was going crazy, so to me that was evidence that I really was. If you think this describes you, it might do you well to get into the habit of questioning your thoughts as well. Is it more logical that your psychiatrist, therapists, family, and friends are correct when they say you\u2019re not crazy and are just experiencing symptoms of anxiety, or that you\u2019re the one person out of the fifty who\u2019s somehow figured out you\u2019re losing it? This applies to basically every anxious situation you may encounter. Remember: **just because you think something doesn\u2019t make it true**. One of the things that took me a long time to realize was that my constant worry over these things was caused by the fact that I was paying so much attention to them. At this point in recovery, it\u2019s absolutely **imperative that you keep yourself occupied, especially when you\u2019re most anxious**. I found that doing things like cooking and cleaning were ways to keep my mind off my anxiety without having to think about it. I suggest doing the same, as they\u2019re both productive and beneficial in the end. Eventually, your mind will calm down on its own and you\u2019ll find your own solutions to these symptoms. I find that at this point the really important thing really is time. Once I felt like I was going crazy for the hundredth time, I realized that if every time before this one was a false alarm, this one (and all the ones after for that matter) are false alarms too. This stage took about 3 months to recover from, but once I did, I hit the next stage. Anxiety is 1 - 3 most days, with some days feeling almost completely anxiety free: You\u2019re in the home stretch. This is it. You\u2019re likely already giving yourself credit for all the hard work you\u2019ve done, but you should still take a moment to recognize just how far you\u2019ve come. For me, having a day where I go out and try something new with friends while anxious is something I wouldn't have been able to do even BEFORE my anxiety disorder. Certainly not anything I\u2019d ever dreamed of while in the thick of it. Seriously, if you\u2019ve hit this point, the light should be at the end of the tunnel. And on the days where it\u2019s a little harder to deal with, let me reassure you: you\u2019re almost home free. Note: your symptoms will still be present at this point. Some of the intrusive thoughts might still come, sometimes you\u2019ll have a bit of dissociation or an occasional almost-panic attack, but you know how to deal with these things. Your moments of panic don\u2019t last more than a few seconds, and your symptoms don\u2019t really illicit a response from you. At this stage: **1.** You know what works best for you. Keep doing it. You have your techniques and you\u2019ve clearly demonstrated they work. All that\u2019s left is to keep doing them and reap the rewards you know will come. On the worse days when your anxiety peaks at a 3 or 4, remind yourself where you were several months ago and how you\u2019ll never experience anxiety that bad ever again. Then gently engage yourself in something and ride the wave of anxiety until it subsides. **2.** Slowly lose your crutches. If you discuss your anxiety with your friends, stop doing so as frequently and eventually stop altogether. If you\u2019re still occasionally taking benzos, slowly taper off. The more of your independence you get back, the more confident you\u2019ll feel. **3.** Keep exploring other areas of your life where you\u2019ve had anxiety and use what you\u2019ve learned to stop worrying. For me, this meant things like conquering my fear of heights by going snowboarding, and confronting my discomfort with physical and emotional intimacy by going out of my way to discuss these things. The more of these long-standing anxieties you\u2019re able to ease, the better you\u2019ll feel overall. Plus you get the added sense of achievement for doing things that past you would\u2019ve never been able to do. There really isn\u2019t much left to say at this stage. I found myself being discouraged more frequently at this point just because I knew I was so close to the finish line but not quite there. In case you need any encouragement, remind yourself of how well you\u2019ve done so far and that there\u2019s more to come. Then finally\u2026 No anxiety, with the worst days peaking at a 0.5 or 1: That\u2019s it. All the voices in your head telling you you\u2019re not good enough have gone silent. All those symptoms you used to worry so much about don\u2019t really happen anymore. You might still be a bit fatigued or foggy some days, but most of the time you\u2019re energetic, present, and can confront new challenges with a sense of confidence you\u2019ve never had. It\u2019s been a few months since you\u2019ve even given your anxiety a second thought. You know some of your symptoms might come back for a short spell every once in a while, but you\u2019re not worried about them. You know exactly what to do when that happens, and that they\u2019ll go away just as quickly as they came. I don\u2019t have any advice for this point. You know what got you here and have built up the mental fortitude to know you\u2019ll keep on doing it. Congratulations. You understand how amazing it is that you got to this point. Remember this feeling. _ My therapist once gave me a great rule of thumb I think sums things up really well: whatever your anxiety is telling you to do, do the opposite. If it\u2019s telling you not to get out of bed, do it. If it\u2019s telling you not to go to a social event, do that. If it\u2019s telling you you\u2019re going to suffer from some grave illness, remind yourself that\u2019s not true. If it\u2019s telling you to google your symptoms or ask for help, don\u2019t. If it\u2019s telling you you\u2019re losing your mind, remind yourself you\u2019re not. Give it enough time, and eventually things will get better. **Summary:** **Ease into your symptoms. Remember that it\u2019s just anxiety and can\u2019t do anything other than make you uncomfortable. You\u2019ve been through this a hundred times before and survived every single time.** **Don\u2019t fight it. When you fight your anxiety, it only gets worse. So let your anxiety do whatever it wants and just watch as a detached observer.** **Keep yourself occupied. The more time you spend thinking about your anxiety, googling your symptoms, posting on this subreddit, writing in your journal, or just stewing in general, the worse off you\u2019ll be. Cook, clean, dance, exercise, paint, draw, do anything you can to forcibly rip your mind off your anxiety.** **Keep pushing the bounds of what you\u2019re doing. Expose yourself to more anxiety. Exercise harder. Try things you\u2019ve never tried before. Make your anxiety flare up as much as possible because you know it\u2019ll only benefit you in the end.** **Regularly question your thoughts. Just because you think something doesn\u2019t make it true. You\u2019ll find a hundred times out of a hundred the thing you\u2019ve been dreading isn\u2019t half as horrible as your brain has made it out to be.** **Give it time. You\u2019ll find once you experience the same anxiety for the same reason for the thousandth time in a row that it becomes a bit easier to stop believing what it tells you.** Thank you for reading this.

I've been dealing with anxiety for years, but I've always managed to keep it under wraps at work. Yesterday, during a team meeting, I felt it building up the rapid heartbeat, the dizziness, the overwhelming urge to flee. Before I knew it, I was hyperventilating in front of everyone. I was mortified. I thought, \"Great, now everyone knows I'm a mess.\" But then something unexpected happened. My boss calmly ended the meeting and sat down next to me. She didn't bombard me with questions or make a scene. She just said, \"It's okay. Let's take a walk.\" We went outside, and she shared that her sister also struggles with anxiety. She told me to take the rest of the day off and offered resources our company provides for mental health.

(I'll be discussing needles and medical stuff in this post!) I am **SO** proud of myself, and I know only people with anxiety will be able to appreciate the strength this took and how much of a victory it is! I have always had a severe needle phobia (avoided HPV vaccine in school, flu shot, refused tetanus and refused all blood tests). It got to a point where I had to get my flu shot up my nose as a spray every year (ridiculous, I know. but the phobia was deeply ingrained into me) I knew I would finally have to face my phobia again with the COVID vaccine. Because I knew if I freaked out and just avoided it, it wouldn't be just me I was endangering. Since the start of the year, the vaccine is all I've been thinking about. I was *dreading* getting that text message to say it was my turn. And then I was having several panic attacks a day leading up to the appointment. It was pretty rough. When the nurse called me in and sat me down, it felt like I was going to pass out or puke or burst into tears... but then I just had this... surreal moment of clarity. I just focused on one of the wall tiles and just... almost tuned out of the situation. And then I felt it go in, and it hurt and I was terrified, but also strangely empowered? Like I couldn't believe I actually got to this exact moment without losing it and running out. I felt dizzy with relief and happiness when it was over, I think the nurse probably thought I was crazy haha. I'm just so damn proud I've faced one of my fears.

I (14M) have an extreme fear of exams. Especially if it's an exam in a subject where I'm weak at. I just hate them so much.

Even if I do study, my mom will bombard me with questions, force me to learn even more and just ruin my way of studying in general. I remember I memorized 4 fantasy stories for an exam (where we had to write a fantasy story of course, and yes, children already have tests/exams worth 50% of the grade at 4th grade) when I was 11 and memorized tons of other stories for an exam for 5 hours straight when I was 12. Now I just don't want to study because it is NOT fun at all and the stuff that I studied for the exam won't be used for the rest of the year. The anxiety I get from exams flip my mood 180\u00b0 and no matter what I do (go outside, play video games, talk with friends, etc.), it doesn't help.

I used to have anxiety in my teens, which I most notably had spiralling negative thoughts \"what if I'm gay and dont know\" is an example of MANY. For the purposes of this post I am 100% straight, which is relevant below. I had lots of anxiety and stress at work, which was understandable with a clear cause. A change of job has largely removed this. But this seems to have brought a resurgence in more general anxiety. I have anxiety with driving, finding immense overwhelm when parking if people are about to witness. I even take longer journeys to avoid junctions or roads I believe I won't like. I had work anxiety like I mentioned above. And have in the past and more recently had anxiety in the forms of various \"what ifs\" or negative feelings. I even have anxiety in making this post, as it feels to admit some kind of abnormality or weakness (which of course I know is ridiculous in terms of trying to help myself and fix things). Most recently, I've had spiralling thoughts on my 5 year relationship with my girlfriend. To be clear, I feel happy and we are in a good place and she is my better half in a lot of ways. However, I have developed this fear of not being in love or not happy? It all feels confusing, I would say 95% of the time I love her to bits and feel happy. Then suddenly I get a negative thought, like \"what if we broke up\" or the \"what if I don't really love her\". I then spiral and I feel myself trying to convince myself that I do and why. Like I said before, I have always had various negative and anxious thoughts, some of which aren't how I am truly feeling. However it is so hard as I feel i dont know my own mind, and as a result im trying to convjnce myself or discover my true \"thoughts\".

I\u2019m a 20-year veteran with 4 deployments. During my first deployment, I suffered an injury on the left side of my face that required 2 surgeries (septoplasty and turbinoplasty) to repair a deviated septum and remove scar and bone/calcium built up after the injury. Before the surgery, it felt like I couldn\u2019t breathe out of my left side nose trail and affected my running and other physical activities until the surgery. 25 years have passed since then, but now I am starting to have some issues again. A few months ago, I began to suddenly wake up in the middle of the night with extreme anxiety, feeling like I couldn\u2019t breathe. I ran outside the house feeling like I was drowning. It was wintertime, so the cold somehow helped, and little by little, with the help of my wife, I began to calm down. It had never happened before until now. Since then, I spoke to my PCM at the VA and got a referral for ENT. My psych prescribed a few Xanax for the anxiety for when it hits the worst. The ENT says there is not a deviated septum (which was my first though) not scar tissue built up over time (like before) but since the first time it happened, I started trying every single thing I can find to try to help it\u2026 from trying every single nose device that flares the nose to break better at night (have found a few that work, but my inside of the nose is now raw from the in/out and the mucus irritating it from the foreign device that was never before there), the Airwav mouth guard, trying Afrin and phenols prone sprays (kids dose only at night before bed), but it seems that ow has become a crutch and I can\u2019t sleep without all of these things\u2026 the thought of having to do this every night gives me even more anxiety. I remember the surgery I had. They put those plastic blades in the sinus cavity, and I remember I couldn\u2019t breathe but through my mouth then. And the thought of it gives me anxiety. I don\u2019t think I can make it through weeks of having those things in my nose for weeks until it heals, swelling goes down, and pain subsides\u2026 never mind that I can\u2019t take pain meds because of prior issues with narcotics due to multiple surgeries over a 3-year period that kept me on pain management long-term that did their own damage\u2026 now it\u2019s all me, nothing but Tylenol, and as I type this with my wife lying in bed next to me at 1:24AM not able to sleep because of this crippling anxiety that makes me have to take a half Xanax just to hope to be able to sleep while listening to anxiety-reducing meditations on YouTube\u2026 I am at a loss, and my mind wonders where it shouldn\u2019t after thinking about it, having to deal with this long-term and worse, putting my wife through this\u2026 it affects everything from sleep, turns what could be a good day into a bad one, and I am tired of it\u2026 I just wanted to put this out there to see if someone else experiences this, knows what \u201cthis\u201d is, does it have a name?

But a LOT more so recently. I'd say the past two years. I don't have much experience with it and I wonder what I should do about it, who to consult etc... Basically my very first time having a real anxiety episode was when my first child was born. It was right after months of over working at my job. I was under a LOT of stress, pressure to perform and long hours. I had clearly mismanaged and neglected my mental health during that time and it all came bursting out during my wife's giving birth to our firstborn. I had a huge panic attack. Felt like I had lost all control over my body and emotions for a good 2 hours minimum. After that I had nothing happen for like 1 year maybe 2. The 2nd time, it happened when again I was exerting myself at work. I was on a romantic getaway with my wife (although I should have taken a longer getaway... I needed 7 days of rest instead of the added stress of trying to compensate for months of exertion through a mere weekend of rest). I was at the movies with her and right in the middle of the movie I had a tachycardia. Heart went racing so much I thought I was going to have a heart attack for sure. I even took my phone out, prepared to dial 911 and told my wife to be ready to call them in case I truly had a heart attack. Turns out it was another panic attack... Again for about 3 hours I couldn't get control back of my emotional state... Didn't help that I had a LOT of caf\u00e9ine prior to going in the movie theater plus the neglected stress overdose from work.... More recently I started doing a rather difficult job. The stress is different. It's not from too many hours it's from the multitude of very negative self esteem emotions it produces. Has to do with starting a business and the early parts have been tough. It's hard not to compare and feel like a failure to myself and my family. So this time around its very degrading negative emotions that are taking their toll... Potentially other health issues. I've had two or 3 other tachycardia episodes within the last 3 months. But they were lesser in intensity except the first one. The other big one is I've been getting food impactions randomly throughout the last 2 years. Happened maybe 10 times or so. Various intensity levels. But basically, I end up with a feeling stuck food in my throat. I can still breath just fine, but it takes some effort to get the food gown to my stomach. Obviously stress doesn't help during those events as it tightens the esophagus even more I suppose. So I've decided I really need to see a doctor soon because I don't know if these issues combined are real health issues from a physical problem (some heart condition or other) And I have no idea what to make of a my anxiety issues.

What has helped me stay strong in the moment is staying healthy & getting blood work done and checked by your doctor to make sure that everything is fine with me so I know that when I feel terrible/anxious I know that it\u2019s anxiety and it will pass, also I wouldn\u2019t consider myself a very religious person but I like to pray in the mornings & I believe that having faith can help keep a positive attitude and outlook on certain situations.

Start with the least intimidating step and work your way up. 4. Celebrate small victories along the way. For instance, if you're afraid of networking, your ladder might look like this: Step 1: Make eye contact and smile at a stranger. Step 2: Say \"hello\" to someone new.

For the past about five years [since covid began basically] I've been a shut in, like I've left my house maybe 15 times in total since & everytime a parent/grandparent or sibling was w/ me. So needless to say I'm very anxious to be On My Own. The main sources of my anxiety are: 1: Fitness level. I'm trying to go on walks & exercise more before starting, but I'm horribly unfit [like winded going up a small set of stairs or checking the mail unfit] & while once I'm there I'll be in one spot, the bus stop-->where I'll be working is [for me] a super long walk so I'm really anxious about not being able to walk that [again I am exercising now to try & lessen it, but since I'm so horribly unfit I'm worried what I'm capable of doing now won't heavily effect that] 2: Bus. I've been on the bus before so ik how the process works but I'm very anxious & paranoid. I'm anxious that I'll miss my stop[s? I haven't checked the routes yet so idk if I'll need only one bus or several] but the MAIN part I'm worried about & ik this is extreme, is I'm worried about getting killed or kidnapped or something off the bus, especially since some of my shifts will be late getting off [& some of my shifts someone could probably meet me at the bus stop on the way home/walk me to it before work, but most of them, like my first day, that won't be an option because it'll clash w/ their work]. Plus as paranoid as I am I'm weirdly not a very Aware person, so I feel like unfortunately I maybe wouldn't notice if I was being followed [or my brain would go \"I'm being paranoid this is probably a normal everyday person who happens to go the same way\" which in 99% of cases would be fine cause that'd be the case but I'm worried I'll do that when it's not the case] 3: That I won't be able to handle it. It's my first job & during the talks & stuff they asked if I've ever worked & they were nice & said \"Don't worry thats fine, we'll train you [place I work] is a good place for a first job\" & ik someone who works there & she likes it there, but still. I'm worried that first week or two I'll be fired [or so stressed I'll quit, which I don't wanna do I need a job & the pay is good, but I'm still worried]. Sorry if this makes no sense. Basically I'm asking for advice on how to alleviate these anxieties, if any of y'all have any tips on certain aspects [like advice for going out alone for the first time, first time bus rider tips to make the experience less daunting, etc] ? Oh & this isn't an anxiety thing, but for folks who get really car sick, is bus rides the same [like just as car sick on a bus as in a car] or is it better [bus rides less sick than cars] or worse ?

A few weeks ago, I was to have surgery and was given Triazolam with laughing gas to sedate me enough for IV sedation, and it caused a severe negative reaction. I experienced hallucinations of a paradoxical reality within the duality, and other visuals I have a hard time describing other than I was actively tripping as if I had taken some sort of psychedelic drug. It was awful. I did not have the surgery because I was hostile, and unwilling to cooperate (don't remember that), and now have the new surgery coming up. I am completely traumatized. That event was so deeply triggering that I don't know how to cope with the reality that it may happen again. Now, I have rationalized it (to the best of my capabilities). The medical staff provided a benzodiazepine (something I cannot have), and the mixture of gas definitely didn't help.

Even when something is someone\u2019s job - such as a store clerk wishing you a good day, or the coffee shop person chatting you up per corporate policy. They are still extending love. Accept the little moments of love. Accept the little moments of safety, too. Right now, in this moment in time, you are safe. It is okay to be afraid. I still love you. Do you love you? You must. Hold yourself, please. Do it for me. Put your arms around yourself. Pet your face gently. Tell yourself, \u201cI love you. You are safe. It is okay to be afraid. There is nothing wrong with you. You are human and you are feeling afraid and I am here with you.\u201d Do not treat yourself with contempt and do not abandon yourself for being afraid. You deserve unconditional love. Stay with yourself and be kind to yourself even though you are struggling. Tell yourself, \u201cI will not abandon you. I will not judge you. I will not reject you just because you are afraid.\u201d Keep your promise to yourself. Tell yourself \u201cI love you, sweetheart.\u201d When you are ready, share a small bit of love with others. Smile to them. Say please and thank you. Wish them well. Be kind. Let them merge in traffic. Do it without expectation for something in return. Pick up a piece of trash because you love the park. Say, \u201cI love you park. Let me help you feel nice. It\u2019s okay. I got this.\u201d (Even if you just say it in your head). Radiate love and safety. Receive love and safety. I love you.

Magnifying this percentage to the entire USA population, that would mean the death rate for the virus is 0.015 percent, about on par with the seasonal flu. thanks /u/logicalcreations2406 for posting this! some really good news regarding asymptomatic spread! Per Wuhan Health Commission, the 300 asymptomatic carrier identified by large scale PCR testing between 15/05/2020 and 01/06/2020 have had their saliva and throat swab sample taken, and these samples have undergone isolation and incubation experiment at Chinese Academy of Science Wuhan. All samples have failed to result in incubation of live virus. Experts believe the negative result of incubation experiments with the saliva and throat swab sample point at either minuscule viral load, or non-viable viral fragments unable to cause infection. Furthermore, samples from toothbrush, drinking cups, masks, towels and other personal effects have been taken from the 300 asymptomatic carriers, all have tested negative. On top of this, 1174 close contacts of the 300 asymptomatic carriers identified have all tested negative on PCR tests. All of these point at the conclusion that the asymptomatic carriers discovered in Wuhan are not infectious.

I made this post because I saw many posts talking about how scared folks are. Truth be told, I am scared too. I'm scared everyday. That's life with anxiety. Sometimes it is really small and it feels like I can just \"ignore\" it and put it in my back pocket, and sometimes it is really huge and like a gigantic elephant stomping around in my brain. I recognize the tendency in myself to get caught up in negative feedback loops (including obsessively reading about horrible things and obsessing over current events) and decided I would post something somewhat different for us because sometimes, just being honest, coming to /r/anxiety can leave me feeling a bit more anxious, lol.

There are so many of us out there who want to see good things come out in the world.

One by one, as they march, our comrades vanish from our sight, seized by the silent orders of omnipotent Death. Very brief is the time in which we can help them, in which their happiness or misery is decided. Be it ours to shed sunshine on their path, to lighten their sorrows by the balm of sympathy, to give them the pure joy of a never-tiring affection, to strengthen failing courage, to instil faith in hours of despair. Let us not weigh in grudging scales their merits and demerits, but let us think only of their need--of the sorrows, the difficulties, perhaps the blindnesses, that make the misery of their lives; let us remember that they are fellow-sufferers in the same darkness, actors in the same tragedy as ourselves. And so, when their day is over, when their good and their evil have become eternal by the immortality of the past, be it ours to feel that, where they suffered, where they failed, no deed of ours was the cause; but wherever a spark of the divine fire kindled in their hearts, we were ready with encouragement, with sympathy, with brave words in which high courage glowed.\" - Bertrand Russell, A Free Man's Worship", "gbnjuv": "Anyone else anxious and scared about lockdown being lifted and having to attain responsibility and normality again?

Like probably everyone else here I have tried a ton of different traditional methods to relieve anxiety such as breathing exercises, meditation, journaling, therapy, working out etc and while those are amazing methods that work for some, sometimes nothing seems to help in the moment. So I started experimenting and came up with some unconventional tricks (and some I\u2019ve picked up from others) that work surprisingly well for me! I have separated methods into different categories so you can browse each category depending on what works for you! **Body Oriented:** * **Turn Your Room Cold** \\- Turn the heat down or open a window. A colder space can sometimes help your body calm down. * **Chug a Bottle of Water** \\- It\u2019s refreshing and forces you to pause for a second. Bonus: dehydration can make anxiety worse, so this helps on two levels. * **Lay on Your Other Side (Away From Your Heart)** \\- If you\u2019re lying on your left side and can feel your heartbeat too strongly, flip over. It can stop you from hyper-focusing on it. * **Dunk Your Face in Ice Water/Take a Cold Shower** \\- This one feels extreme but it really works. It triggers your \"dive reflex,\" which slows your heart rate and calms your nervous system. * **Hold Ice Cubes or Something Cold** \\- The cold sensation brings you back into your body and out of your head. * **Sit on the Floor** \\- Just plop down wherever you are. Sitting on the ground can make you feel more grounded. **Mind Tricking:** * **Spell Words Backward** \\- Pick a random word (like elephant for example) and spell it in reverse. Keep repeating with different words until you are distracting enough to break the cycle of anxious thoughts. * **Count Things Around You** \\- Look around the room and count how many blue objects you can see or how many things are round. * **Force Yourself to Smile** \\- Even fake smiling can trigger endorphin release and convince your brain you\u2019re okay. * **Do Some Math** \\- Start at 100 and count backward by 7s. Or do a Times table. **Behavorial:** * **Flip Your Environment Around** \\- Rearrange your furniture, your desk, or even just your pillows. Cleaning up your space can shift your mindset too. * **Play The Floor Is Lava** \\- Lol like the game you played as a kid. Jumping around the room is a great distraction. * **Eat Some Crunchy or Sour Snacks** \\- The texture, taste and sound give your mind something else to focus on. * **Wrap Yourself With Blankets** \\- Weighted blankets are ideal, but even regular ones can work. * **Gratitude** \\- Think about everything you are grateful for. This can help take your mind off of insecurities you are thinking about. **Environmental:** * **Turn on White Noise or Static** \\- The background hum of white noise can calm your brain if silence feels too loud. However, this one sometimes leads to hyperfocusing on intrusive thoughts, dissociation or depersonalization for me, so proceed with caution. * **Dim the Lights or Change the Color** \\- Swap your lighting for something softer or cooler (like blue or green tones). * **Smell Something Really Strong** \\- Smell something like peppermint, citrus, or even vinegar because a strong scent can \"shock\" your senses and pull you out of your anxious headspace. **Interactive:** * **Carry Something Heavy** \\- Holding something with weight can help ground you. * **Balance on One Leg** \\- It sounds weird, but focusing on balancing can help distract you. * **Scribble** \\- Grab a pen and just scribble as hard and fast as you can. Helps release energy, is super calming, and can help distract you * **Stare at Something Moving** \\- Watch a fan, a candle flame, bobblehead, the snow falling outside, etc. It gives your mind something repetitive and calming to focus on. However, this one also sometimes leads to hyperfocusing on intrusive thoughts, dissociation or depersonalization for me, so again, proceed with caution.

No one seems to understand that for some people it's a tremendous struggle. As the original post got quite a lot of attraction I'll post an update. Original post: [ &#x200B; Yesterday evening I got a call that they wanted me there today. I said sure, started prepping for the journey ( buses/trains are the most difficult part for me ). I ate all the right foods, slept enough, felt good. I took max dose of meds to \"guarantee\" success. Even with the meds and proper mindset, I was struggling at the second I left the house. Every step felt heavy, I wanted to turn back instantly. I made it to the first train then to the trainstation which had a bathroom. I had 45minutes to gather my thoughts before taking the next train to the destination. I got on the train and things just got worse and worse and worse. Every passing stop I just wanted to jump out, crawl into a ball and cry. 2nd to last stop it became unbearable. I jumped off the train and took the next bus home. Mission failed. I called my employer and was brutally honest about my situation. They seemed very understanding and offered to keep a 0hr contract indefinitely if I get my things together to a stage where I can reliably commute to work. So I made a good first impression and this guy seemed to appreciate honesty instead of me making up some bs lie about \" having some upper respetory symptoms \" or whatever which would've bought me some time. But I like honesty. I don't have to remember any lies and a lot of people appreciate it. Even tho they were very kind and understandable, I feel like absolute shit right now. For past 7months my **only** goal was get a job, go there, do well. Be normal. Today even with medication I couldn't do that. I haven't given up all hope yet and I'll start improving my diet even more and hopefully get to therapy asap. Apparently for people like me, sometimes the therapist meets half way if they know that leaving the house is difficult for the patient. Or even comes to your house. So that's great. This was a major, major setback, but as my dad says \" You do everything you can, and that's all you can do \". I did everything. I prepared for everything. I had everything packed hours before leaving the house. I had a plan for when I get to work. But nope. Anxiety and panic disorder won this battle. Hopefully I'll win the war.

(Also im new to Reddit and don\u2019t know how exactly this works, so if I do anything wrong please let me know) So I\u2019m currently 18 years old and as for my childhood I\u2019d say it was okay. I was a pretty shy and \u2018good\u2019 kid so never got into trouble much. That\u2019s also why I can\u2019t recall ever being yelled at or hit. Maybe once, but my parent did apologise and state what they did wasn\u2019t okay so I don\u2019t think that would have affected me. However, I get so anxious when I hear anybody yell. It doesn\u2019t even have to be directed at me. A few examples: one of my teachers has a pretty strong, loud voice. When he suddenly calls out a student\u2019s name while I\u2019m doing my homework, I pretty much flinch even though his tone isn\u2019t even angry. Or a few weeks ago when a classmate wasn\u2019t wearing a mask, a teacher followed them into our classroom and basically yelled at them for at least a minute. While this was going on, I forced myself to just look down at my notebook and focus on anything but the yelling. Though I tried to distract myself, my eyes were teary and I felt a lump in my throat and I was really tense for the rest of that class. I think that was the most anxious I had felt in years. My sibling who is 12 can be described as a \u2018troublemaker\u2019 I guess. They\u2019re the opposite of me which can be good at times, but it sometimes gets on my parents\u2019 nerves. They don\u2019t listen, aren\u2019t okay with being told \u201cno\u201d and pretty much do what they want when they feel like it. Because of this I often hear my parents being upset at them and I\u2019ve heard my parent yell at them a lot. Sometimes I\u2019d be in the same room, other times I\u2019d be in my room and they\u2019d be downstairs. During these times I\u2019ll also get very tense and just have a horrible feeling.

That everybody should inherently be able to cope the same way, that they have the same environment, resources, peers, etc to deal with the problem, in healthy manners.

Or does the music we listen to not have an effect?", "1jh2itf": "Should We Bring Mental Health Institutions Back?/ Can Mental Health Institutions Solve the Crisis on Our Streets? I've been thinking a lot about the state of mental health care in Canada. When you walk through any downtown area (in Toronto in my case), you can\u2019t help but notice the growing number of people on the streets, many struggling with homelessness, addiction, and severe mental health issues. Right now, the mental health system isn\u2019t enough to handle these cases. Community mental health services, while well-intended, aren\u2019t equipped to deal with people in crisis. These individuals often need immediate detoxification, stabilization, and psychiatric intervention before they can begin therapy or cognitive restructuring. Instead, people are left without proper care, creating a flood of individuals on the streets who are severely neglected. I recently watched a video about an individual named Rabbit, a man with so much potential who tragically passed away a few years after documenting his journey through addiction and mental health struggles in Toronto. He faced homelessness, drugs, lack of support, and connection. His story is heartbreaking because it shows how easily someone can slip through the cracks in our system. Rabbit\u2019s death isn\u2019t just a tragedy - it's an example of how our current mental health care systems fail people in crisis. I also recently wrote a paper on the Belleville crisis, and it\u2019s clear to me that we're in the midst of a serious mental health and addiction emergency in Canada This is why I believe we need to bring back mental health institutions, but with a focus on recovery and rehabilitation. These institutions should be the first layer of care - providing stabilization and psychiatric support for people in acute crisis before transitioning them to community-based therapy. The goal should be recovery, not just managing symptoms or keeping people in institutions for extended periods. # How Could We Fund It Without Burdening Taxpayers? I get it - funding is the biggest issue. But I think we can find a way where taxpayers don\u2019t bear the burden. Here\u2019s how: * **Sin taxes** on substances like alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, and pharmaceutical companies. These industries make profits from addictions, so they should help fund the institutions that treat them. * **Gambling taxes** could also be a source of funding. * **Corporate responsibility programs** where large corporations contribute to mental health initiatives would help as well. This way, we can recycle money from industries that contribute to mental health crises, rather than relying on taxpayers to foot the bill. # Why This Matters * We need better care for people with severe mental health and addiction issues. A layered approach - starting with stabilization in a mental health institution and moving to community-based therapy\u2014could lead to better long-term outcomes. * Mental health institutions wouldn\u2019t just help the individuals in crisis; they would also create more jobs in the mental health field. There\u2019s a huge gap in the workforce, and many people with degrees in psychology are struggling to find work. This could help bridge that gap. * By reintegrating mental health care into institutional settings, we can give people a chance at recovery, rather than leaving them in a constant cycle of crisis.

Normally I would just get upset and move on, however I noticed that this TikTok video came from a content creator, Sarina, who actually is a psychology student at an Ivy League school that claims her tiktok account is meant to educate others (she even names her account \u201cpsychandeducation\u201d). I have been in psychiatric units and I\u2019ve shared with the staff, and on one occasion with a group of psychology interns, many embarrassing stories and details about my trauma; mainly because I trusted they would reserve all judgment and trusted that what I said and did in the psychiatric unit would be kept confidential. So seeing her (Sarina) violate patient confidentiality and that trust patients have with their mental health treatment team in psych units made me upset enough to leave a comment. She should not violate patient-provider confidentiality and judge a patient, especially one that is a child, with severe mental illness. Not to mention going on to share their experience for tens of thousands of strangers to laugh at on the internet. In my comment, I said \u201cbut they\u2019re mentally Ill smh\u201d and several people liked it. She responded that she actually has no judgment and this was meant for education (I\u2019m not going to bother explaining how that\u2019s just not the case). Anyway, I ended up commenting back: \u201cI have no judgment for this at all!\u201d *proceeds to judge a child with severe mental illness for tiktok clout* She deleted my comment and blocked me less than a second later. I guess she knew I was right and needed to silence me. So much for wanting to educate, huh? Let\u2019s put an end to tiktok content creators in the psych field exploiting mentally ill patients under the guise of \u201ceducation\u201d.

At the end of the day yes, we all do have to eventually toughen it out and get over it, but when you try your best to move on every day exerting excruciating amount of effort. it just gets me mad because that's not how it works at all, if you can then that's good but for me, I've tried to and it doesn't work that easily for me. mental illness is real, you cant toughen out everything just like in one go in a day, pain doesn't subside like that, when you've experienced trauma. It just really makes me mad when people say that its really insensitive when I'm trying my best, I know that's what I have to do. its like people don't think that you have to move on but I do, I try to \"get over it\" everyday adopting new mindset's and being excited about the future and working on myself constantly every day to the point where its my main priority no work just working on my mental health.

Saying it\u2019s \u201cno excuse\u201d is like saying that the person doesn\u2019t have a legitimate problem. It\u2019s like saying someone with the flu has no excuse for staying in bed. I know a woman who developed some pretty severe OCD and Depression and she ended up giving away her dog because she had been neglecting it.. and some other folks I know were saying her mental illness was \u201cno excuse\u201d for the neglect and that she took on that responsibility and was wrong for giving the dog up.

If they actually invested more in people and environment than the military and big business. If the people here had their basic needs met, a good education and didn\u2019t have to struggle so much to survive, I dont think mental health would be nearly as big of an issue. think about it, if you had what you needed: a safe space that you own, healthcare without dealing with insurance, a supportive community, a healthy environment, a purpose, healthy food and all the resources you need to live well, would we be as \u2018ill\u2019 as we are?

I just think having compassion and caring for your people is more important than money or power because what are we without each other or support? lonely, angry and afraid.

One doctor even accused me of faking, saying I wasn't trying hard enough, which convinced me I was lazy and a faker. They really did convince me that I'm even lying to myself. So when I was all alone and still struggling, I told myself I'm just self pitying and ignored the pain. Eventually I just quit therapy and medication, tried to fix myself through exercise and diet. But the horrors in my head never stopped. I had obsessive thoughts, irrational fears, and weird delusions, even tried to fix them with spiritual practices, but nothing worked obviously. I kept it all to myself. I got a job but I rarely slept so I'd fall asleep at work. I froze in front of people, stuttered, and obviously got fired. Then I got an online job, but was fired again due to poor communication skills and \"ai can do it better than you.\" Things have gotten really bad for me.

Always almost perfect grades across the board. Even graduating #1 at the automotive school in 2018. Tons of awards all through school. What was this stark contrast? It came together after a conversation with a 21 year old classmate. On the most recent Chemistry exam, she got 8/28 28%, and I got 11/28 39%. She had made the comment that maybe she needs a med adjustment for a bit more focus. That statement hit me very hard. This is my first experience with school while being treated for bipolar 1.

No studying for tests, slamming through assignments right before class, writing a couple page English papers in less than an hour, never failing. This is different.

I saw how I could convince myself that setbacks happen but it doesn't mean you're not progressing, it doesn't mean you'll forever be depressed. I used to say this as a temporary spell to break me out of an episode, but after a while I really believed in it. I did things that I would have never done and it actually brought me joy. So I decided to stop and \"graduate\" from therapy 2 months ago (as my therapist said lol). I've had 2 meltdowns that lasted for 3-4 days since I stopped. The bigger one was the recent one where I got so anxious about deciding on my future career path that I got a panic attack and got stuck in an episode for 3 days. I know this is related to anxiety, but everytime this happens I revert back to how I lived when I was abroad and depressed alone. I cant eat much, cant bring myself to shower, I have to fake being able to talk to people and space out the whole day. I feel useless and unworthy, I wasted every day feeling guilty of being useless, and then I feel guilty for wasting time. I have zero confidence in myself, I've been living my life based on other people's opinions and advices and I've been through a lot of bad times when I made the decision. I dont have my own space to fully process all the emotions and thoughts, and I dont like asking/talking to my friends and family because i feel like they dont really understand what I'm going through (only one friend had depression but she was also the cause of mine so sometimes I don't feel comfortable talking about it with her) so the feelings got worse and made me think of su**ide.

To his credit, he has kept his cool so far even though I didn't trust him at first. My psychiatrist says I'm improving but the only role a psychiatrist really plays is medicine management so it's all a matter of are the meds working or not. Thankfully they are which is why I'm only posting and talking about it and often instead of acting out impulsively and destroying things like I used to in high school. I think one of my main problems right now is that I'm readjusting to being completely sober instead of just California sober. The pain I've been going through is just searing hot, unlike My peers who can go out and have a drink or smoke a joint and turn those feelings off, I don't get that luxury.

The constant worrying if someone is okay. I've been met with a lot of criticism for speaking out and being honest and I'm honestly to the point where I don't care and I get combative because this is what I was trying to do. I was trained to talk It out. There's just one big problem though. I don't trust the immediate people around me because of all the criticism I've gotten so I've been posting on Reddit about it. I know it's sad but in between therapy, this is the only place I feel safe. If somebody says something I don't like I can just block them and I never have to hear it again. I don't mean to be an inconvenience to anybody but at some point I had to put at least a little bit of my training from therapy into action or else what was the point? I don't know. Sometimes I feel like I'm just a burden on everybody and maybe I would be better off dead but I can't do that to my family so I suffer. I don't feel like anybody understands me. My therapist barely understands me as hard as he tries. I'm not a very religious guy but I've even taken to praying at the cemetery and it's one of the few times I actually do get a little bit of peace in my troubled mind. Something about the quiet air and being able to look up at the stars next to my dad's grave is somehow soothing. I guess the best way I can put this is that I am okay but I'm not okay.

How can I get over it? (NHS CBT, UK) Sorry in advance for a ramble and a vent. TLDR at bottom. Firstly I think I've struck gold with my current T, considering the horror stories I've heard about the NHS Mental Health Teams. He is gentle, kind, professional, has a good sense of humour, serious about his job, and very approachable. He also has this great approach where; it's CBT, but he does a lot of counselling tier reflection and mindfulness too. This works great for me. Yes, I have some very obvious transference. Originally, this was paternal, however now we have spoke about it and my other attachment issues, I am back to seeing him more as just a therapist, but one I wish I could keep long term and really value. Not sure if that's any better but... \ud83d\ude05 Anyway, I have 4 sessions left before therapy has to end. Truthfully knowing that is absolutely killing me. That one little hour each week is time I truly value, find important, has been a god send for me and my anxiety (which was absolutely crippling prior to starting this therapy.) I've now got a great relationship with my T, loads I want to explore, but feel restricted knowing that end date is looming. I just don't know how to make this ending feel any easier. I am going to discuss it again with him (we have briefly before and he has reassured me if I ever need to refer back into the service, I can) but it's just one of those things where I don't want that. I wish I could just continue with him until I was ready to go (Though I know the NHS doesn't do this). I feel like every single time I do therapy, more issues get brought up, and then I'm left trying to handle them alone, until it gets too much and I have to go through therapy, transference, and grief all over again. (Yes, I have had these feelings prior, but nowhere near this intense.) I know I should be able to do it alone, but having that one person that helps and encourages you each week, and gives you the tools to succeed in helping yourself, along with the reassurance you're using them correctly is great for me. How on earth can I get over this feeling of looming grief? Debating just going private because I truthfully think a therapist helps ground me a lot.

If I don\u2019t put myself in those situations, I don\u2019t have to worry about all those things. She says, that\u2019s good! You\u2019re beginning to see the root problem is discomfort. Comfort is something we naturally seek. It\u2019s built in our DNA. BUT! Comfort all the time has a price. Just like too much of anything; coffee, sugar, working out, alcohol. You\u2019ve trained your mind to view discomfort as an enemy. The feeling of discomfort isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. In some cases it can be, but in some cases it\u2019s the process of growth. It\u2019s like growing pains. Sure you feel achey but your body is in the process of moving to something better. It\u2019s completely fine to feel discomfort when you start to actually pick up the phone, actually go out and get an oil change, or putting yourself out there to your friends. But the more you do it, the more you\u2019ll realize you can do. And the less it will be in the form of discomfort. Give yourself room to fail sometimes but by all means continue forward. It took me a few weeks to think about and process this information until I decided to be brave enough to try. And I have to say, I\u2019m glad I did. Just like she said, I began to see I COULD.

HOWEVER, some of the things they say out of support feel invalidating\ud83d\ude43 I have finally seen a psychologist (and have an appointment set up with a psychiatrist) recently. I\u2019ve been in therapy for years and have felt frustrated with how slow my progress seems to be. That being said, I like my therapist and I had arguably the most life changing year ever last year (the onset of six life altering chronic illnesses does that for ya). I do think my mental health is way better than when I first started therapy, but it\u2019s been so back and forth when I wish it could feel more linear. I\u2019m trying to get into a good headspace before I continue pursuing college especially. That\u2019s what lead me to seeing a psychologist and has me in my current situation. I strongly suspected I had ADHD for a couple of years after my sister was diagnosed. I finally got an examination, and last Wednesday I was diagnosed. This journey in itself was so frustrating because while most of those close to me validated my experiences,I had a handful of people who would say things like \u201cwell you don\u2019t act like my other friend who has it\u201d or just continuously ask me why I think I have it. They came from a place of trying to be reassuring? But instead it just sucked feeling like I had to explain myself and why I was seeking an examination. When my psychologist diagnosed me, she said \u201cWell, I think it\u2019s safe to say you have ADHD, but\u2026\u201d Hence my current dilemma. Basically, during my screening, she said I exhibit very strong signs of having bipolar disorder. She urged me to seek additional screening, as on one specific test, I scored the absolute highest you possibly can for signs of bipolar. I was honestly very shocked but in hindsight, it does make sense. What\u2019s frustrating is one of my closest friends (and roommate), who is diagnosed with bipolar, told me she doesn\u2019t think I exhibit signs of it. It was another situation where she was trying to be helpful, but it just fucking sucks. In the days since that appointment, I\u2019ve had one of the worst depressive episodes I\u2019ve had in a long time. It kind of sent me through a loop that I\u2019m trying very hard to pull myself out of. I\u2019m now at a point where that appointment felt *validating* because it explains my lack of progress, the constant push and pull I feel inside my brain. Again, I don\u2019t know for sure at this time, but just knowing a medical professional sees that makes me know I need to at least be checked. And I do have an appointment set up! This friend just also said \u201cI mean, it\u2019s up to you if you want to get screened.\u201d And it just feels frustrating. I\u2019m tired of my mental health journey being compared to others. Just because I don\u2019t exhibit the same signs as your friend or yourself, doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t possibly have that experience.

Recently I was at a mental hospital for about three months (wasn't my first stay) and I got diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. My therapist recommended that I should do interval therapy (staying at the mental hospital for 2-3 weeks every 1-2 months) to help me get more stable. I still go to school and I don't like the concept of interval therapy. Everything would be very stressful and chaotic. I'd always have to change between staying at home and being at the hospital. Normally I would've graduated this year but because of my mental health and long stay at the hospital I will have to repeat this year. If I do this interval therapy I won't be able to go to school normally at all and I probably won't be able to get proper grades. I'm aware that I probably won't be able to go on like this right now because I'm very unstable but i genuinely don't want to go to the hospital again.

My next planned stay should be at the end of April but I must say, I did not really have ANY profit the last time I was there. There were so many (to me at least) unnecessary therapies. I want to do therapies to help me regulate my feelings and anxiety, how to live with myself and my emotions and I really want to do trauma therapy. I do already have some knowledge and I don't think it's necessary to draw my emotions, to pet animals, to exercise or what skills are. I don't really know if I should go.

Certainly, I was a jealous, lying 11-year old. I was dismissed when I tried to escape an abusive household. Surely, I couldn't make choices for myself and a teenager can only be the cause of problems. I was dismissed when I left home. Of course, I must not have realised what it meant. I was dismissed when I showed signs of depression. Certainly, it only meant that I was finally showing my true colours. It was simply who I was. I was dismissed by a therapist. He fell asleep every time. I was dismissed by another therapist. You see, a therapist cannot do anything for you but show you the door if you start to have suicidal thoughts. I was dismissed when I opened up about my struggles. Surely, a platitude with no later check-in is enough of being a friend. I was dismissed when I shared my feelings. Obviously, I must have no idea what some people go through. People actually suffer, you know? I was dismissed when I shared my situation. 'Why do you care?' 'Why do you stress?' I was dismissed through the obvious. You see, some people end up telling you they really worried about you seeing you like *that*, but apparently they had to wait for you to get better to let you know. I was dismissed by another therapist. Certainly, I must not have been trying enough, do I even have discipline? Well, at least I was acknowledged for being 'indeed' fat. I was dismissed by a psychiatrist. The appointment never happened. I was dismissed when reaching out for professional help. The reality is that it took 8 months to find someone who wasn't even a good match, all the while dealing with suicidal thoughts. I was dismissed when I needed time to process being dismissed. You see, I was creating a bad atmosphere. I was dismissed when I questioned things. Who do I think I am? What do I know? I was dismissed when I showed concern. You see, I must have had too much time on my hands during my unemployment to imagine something was wrong. I was dismissed when I backed my concern with observations. 'Are you on your period?' I was dismissed when I looked for connection. 'You don't matter because I have broken up' I was dismissed when I offered help. Surely, nobody ever does need help. I was dismissed when I needed help to do something. 'Just do it!' I have been dismissed as we all have been in some way. I was lucky to experience it very soon in relationships that should have been safe, when I still couldn't really grasp what it meant. It certainly prepared me better for what I was going to go through. But that doesn't make any of it OK, not with anyone. Reaching out for professional help is brave, it is often what seems like a last resort. But those places are not always safe. I personally experienced only one matching safe place in therapy out of 5. This translates into a 20% chance to find a therapist that would actually be helpful. This is ridiculously low. A therapist being unhelpful, if not straight up bad is *not* a neutral situation. From a place of despair, any interaction has deep impacts. And professionals come with an authority that is hard to fight, especially when our state is fragile, when trying feels hopeless, when our thoughts already need energy to be fought. I want to believe that I've been unlucky, it would mean that things are better for others, but it seems all too common a tendency for me to truly believe that. Mental health issues are on the rise. Maybe you've been lucky, maybe you've looked down on those with such issues, but statistically, your kids, your nephews, are next. It is alarming. I am sharing those snippets of my history because while I was dismissed, you are not. You are not dismissed from playing your part in our collective responsibility to create a caring society. It starts at our level. It starts with how we interpret what we see. How do we label people who don't fit our expectations? How do we react when someone's acting differently than they used to? How do we act towards someone struggling? Do we ever push people to get a sense of satisfaction? It starts in the space between each other. Whether with colleagues, relatives, friends, strangers, lovers. What do we bring to that space? How do we nurture it? Is it shared equally? What can enter it, what can't, and why? It starts with ourselves. Are we accepting ourselves and our flaws? Are we putting our comfort first? Are we allowing connection? Vulnerability? What and who feels safe? What and who doesn't? Why? When are we defensive? When are we betraying ourselves? How is fear guiding us? What are we blocking? What are we fleeing? Are we observing our behaviours and others'? Are we aware of our impact on others and are we taking accountability and responsibility for it? Are we truly listening? Are we acting or hoping? Are we trying, are we questioning, are we learning, are we improving? Or are we dismissing, resigning, avoiding? Helping and receiving help are equally hard. Our efforts may not always matter, they may go unnoticed, get deflected and dismissed. But I think our collective power lies in trying, in refusing to give up, in keeping our light going and making it grow. With every smile, every eye contact, every small act of care, through every way we can show that we remember something about someone because we listened, that we recognise what someone did and contributed to, that we understand a situation someone is going through and how it does feel. It lies in every question that replaces judgment, it lies in acceptance replacing criticism. We're all flawed and we're never going to love everyone. But we don't have to make ourselves feel better at the expense of anyone, we don't have to bond through judgment, through the cultivation of feeling superior to anyone. We can instead start to bond because we make space for each other, because we make each other feel seen, appreciated and accepted. I am not trying to advocate for a naive and impossible vision of interpersonal relationships. But it doesn't take that much to change a dynamic. It's inviting someone to join a group, it's calling out a bully, it's sitting with someone isolated, it's backing the voice of those who speak up, it's showing understanding for those who struggle. It's a thank you, a compliment, a 'are you okay?'. What if we started to truly care for each other and show up? As James Baldwin said: everyone you're looking at is also you. But maybe you first need to see yourself fully. A ridiculous amount my 34 years, I have dealt with mental health issues. I have gone in and out of darkness more than once and reached depths many will luckily never know. Sometimes, life hangs on not much more than a feeling of guilt, a memory of kindness or new music to discover. We are fragile and our battles are unseen a lot of the time. The system is failing us and we are failing each other. It is not to say professional help is not needed and helpful, it absolutely is. If my story is common though, it is easy to not feel that way and to give up. That's why we need to step up for each other.

I continued to go and to therapy (plus hospitalizations) and whatnot until i was 17 then stopped because it felt like a waste of time.

I've been that person who people worry about, the one who struggles. I'm lucky that busting my ass in counseling was something I could do and that helped. I'm lucky that I had a great doctor to check in with every quarter, lucky to have her behind me while I got my medication sorted. I just don't know how much my friend \"N\" is capable of making positive changes in her life, and I don't know how to be friends with someone who can't, in so many ways, stop needing so much and ever get \"better\". Met N (39, NB, I will use different pronouns since she does) about 4.5 years ago or something like that when they were dating someone I know. Moved in fairly quickly because N was living an hour and half away. While N and I were taking a class together, they started to open up big time about their relationship problems. This went on 8 months, hours and hours of talking, until the break up. N stayed with some friends of ours after moving out while she was looking for a new place. Was supposed to be there a month, was there over 3. My friends were expecting a baby at the time and couldn't decorate their nursery because she was in the space. After the break up, there was one big instance of her snapping at me about \"staying friends\" with her ex because I wouldn't stop going to a bimonthly event where he was on the same team as me, nor would I commit to trying to get him kicked out. This was literally the only place I saw him or spoke to him, make 4 hours a month. N was in a good place regarding the ex until after entering a \"relationship sobriety\" 12 step. Suddenly, N went from staying she was fine with possibly attending events where he was soon, to not being able to even attend events he was invited to, needing to check with her sponsor about everything, and resentful of people who \"invited\" him places by sending out invites to an established large group text. They asked me to double check he wasn't going to be at a Christmas party, which I did if not enthusiastically, then bitched to a friend that they hadn't felt supported because I hadn't gushed while doing it I guess. There's a lot I will have to leave out, but N is hyper focused on being social to the detriment of her well being. When she finally rests, she stays in bed until 1:00 PM or 2:00 PM. Their apartment is disgusting half the time, and I don't think their dog is always getting the proper attention. N recently called me at 1:00 AM saying her bipolar symptoms were severe and I told her to go to the hospital and let me know she was there. She did, then dropped off the face of the earth so I had to call around to hospitals to find her. Thankfully they were fine and went home at lunch time. The next day, N asks me if I can watch her dog the following Saturday night so she can go to a party after her second job. I say no, and am secretly fuming. Why is this person not at all focused on counseling or resting or anything to get well when they were just in the hospital with a mental health crisis the night before? Another friend tells me that N didn't get admitted because she couldn't miss work. I had off work randomly the next Tuesday and ran into her. Said they had taken off for a mental health day. Great, we should all do that. But why is that suddenly possible when the week before when they were in the hospital with doctors who could help them, it wasn't possible? Recently, a friend had a birthday party and we all agreed to specifically have it on a Sunday and not Saturday because of N's work schedule and picked one around the friend's birthday. N committed to being there, then a few days later, remembered there was an improv event they wanted to go to on that day. She actually asked if it was possible to reschedule for the upcoming Sunday 3 days away. She asked someone else to reschedule a birthday because there was something else she wanted to do. They asked 4 other people to change their schedules to fit what they wanted to do. Birthday girl explains the reservation is paid for and N still decides to go to the imrpov bullshit and cost our friend the money paid for the reservation. Now, N offered to pay the birthday girl back, but come on. The improv thing was totally a choice and after all picked this day especially in consideration of her, and she knew a reservation had been made and paid for, choosing the dumb improv event was rude as hell. I resent N so much at this point.

(the depression, not cosmic diarrhea) therapy was the only option at the time because i was a youngin' and taking pills was NOTTT the vibe. naturally, as a lower-middle class family, we couldn't afford the long term counselling so i braved it like my ENFP self usually did and decided to battle it head on with fun activities and regular communication with my mum and doctor. that lasted a month. i underestimated the disease....a mistake i wish i could go back and fix. fast forward past a few traumatic events and the list just began to grow. i became well aquatinted with OCD and BPD (borderline personality disorder). from there it spiralled. after becoming somewhat accustomed to the royal ass fucking the cesspool of diseases had to offer me, i spent the rest of my junior/senior years smoking weed to help ease the crushing weight of the trauma and symptoms. skipping class, coming home late, spending money i didn't have, ignoring every warning sign my body offered me by staying high as a military fighter jet from the second i woke up to when i would eventually pass out from the 6 sometimes 7 bowl hits. even then, in my sleep, i was tormented by nightmares. i never allowed myself to process what i was feeling and how it was affecting me....outside of the few hours at night i'd lay awake silently screaming and crying. for help. for release. for an end. i felt alone. my mind was no longer my kingdom. and my body, which had been recently violated at that time, was peeling away from the fragile bones within them. i was lonely, desperate for a release, hungry for love that would heal me, frantically searching for a way out of the grave i had been digging for myself the moment i decided to i was no longer worthy of anything besides misfortune. my mother (god bless her) can read me like a sticky note, but there was only so much she could do and to my fault, only so much of my pain that i would let her see. at that point i had began to run. from my problems, from my home where the eyes of my loved ones widened with worry any time i'd skip a meal or look up at them with sunken features. i spent days away at my friends house, and when her and i weren't smoking our problems away, i hollowed in my bedroom..... the girl i once knew, bright and cheerful, smiling at anyone who would look her way, loving loud, laughing freely, devouring book after book, drawing abstract art and conjuring the most elaborate stories with that stunning imagination of hers, was gone. in her place, stands me. i don't know who i am anymore if i'm being honest. only who i used to be....and anytime i try to seek out a new definition for the person i've become and want to be it only adds insult to injury. each hug, word of praise, \"you're so strong\" \"we love you\" \"you'll get through this\" \"you'll be okay\" feels like road salt packed on the giant festering wound in my chest. the back of my skull hangs open, my brain unaccustomed to the fresh air of positive reinforcement and unconditional love. i feel naked now. vulnerable. afraid of myself and what it means to carry this weight any longer. since quarantine's started i've then been diagnosed with anxiety after a horrible panic attack that sent me to the hospital. i sit for hours trembling in blankets, staring at the paint of my living room walls struggling to focus on something....ANYTHING that'll stop the cold pulsing in my head and jaw. my heart skips beats, they say the palpitations are normal but each one is a stinging reminder of my existence and how expendable it is at the hands of these...things. crawling, slithering, groping through the crevasses of my brain. killing me softly. my body, unfortunately, answers to their calls. the symptoms are normal apparently, and i think that's what scares me the most because i feel like i'm dying every second of the day and i'm expected to live like that. like this. i stopped smoking and that's been a journey in of it self lmao. but more than the desperation to fling myself into the frozen atlantic ocean, weighted down by my despair and a bag of bricks, i'm eager for peace and fulfillment. for change and a future that i have a say in....not the depression or BPD or anxiety. sigh.... i don't know where i thought i was going with this. i lost the motivation to continue typing a while ago but it feels nice to vent :) i've got a consultation with a therapist in a few days and a call with my doctor after that. i'm hoping i can find excitement in the forward movement.... i want to get better. i want to be better for myself. i don't wanna die but i don't wanna live like this anymore (word to bea miller :p) i'm hoping i can learn about my new self and how to love her the same way i loved younger me. i'll name this new era of self improvement and discovery \"the age of circes' bloom\" in honour of the firsts book i've read since this whole fiasco started.

Will I ever be able to function again? 2 years of therapy and I hit a plateau, meds didn\u2019t work for me apart from benzo\u2019s but I\u2019m really cautious with that and alcohol because it\u2019s not a long term solution. Idk anymore man, I just wanna live again, just like I have tonight.", "1jhqkii": "Help what do I do What do I do m(23) hello, I\u2019ve struggled a lot the past 3 years with my mental health and it\u2019s honestly only been a downward spiral this far. It started off with some panic attacks, anxiety and depression, and I have started self harming as of about 2 months ago. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on with me tbh but I\u2019ve noticed some patterns which I\u2019m here to ask about. What stands out the most for me is the CONSTANT mood swings. My mood can go from happy and enthusiastic to sad/even depressed in a matter of hours, sometimes even shorter. I\u2019ve noticed my mood can switch either at random, or from very small changes in my surroundings, thoughts, etc. these mood changes are really frustrating and I don\u2019t know if this is normal or not. It doesn\u2019t feel normal atleast. I can\u2019t recall being like this 4 years ago even. I feel like shit because of this and I don\u2019t trust myself anymore. Note that I\u2019m not currently as depressed (idek if I even am depressed currently) as I was 2 years ago. My self harm stems from self hatred for the most part. Another thing I\u2019ve noticed that genuinely scares me (im just venting atp), is that my feelings towards people also change drastically as my mood changes. I can go from wanting to talk with the person, love the person etc. to almost feeling a weird type of \u201chatred\u201d towards them. It\u2019s hard to describe the exact feeling, but it\u2019s like \u201cI don\u2019t want anything to do with you\u201d pretty much. What scares me is the feelings are very real and I can barely force myself to go against my brain in these moments. This effects both my friends and family. Could this be something undiagnosed or is it normal? do I bring this up with my psychologist? Thoughts?

I\u2019d appreciate any insights from people who have gone through similar things or have experience with mental health. My Symptoms & Struggles: \u2022 Extreme mood swings \u2013 I can feel confident and powerful one moment, then completely worthless the next, multiple times a day. \u2022 Emotional outbursts \u2013 Sometimes I get really angry or aggressive without wanting to, and I regret it later. \u2022 Self-worth issues \u2013 I either see myself as better than others or completely trash. No in-between. \u2022 Identity confusion \u2013 I don\u2019t know who I really am, what I like, or what my personality is. \u2022 Overanalyzing everything \u2013 I think deeply about every small action, to the point where life feels unnatural and disconnected. \u2022 Paranoia & hypervigilance \u2013 I feel like people might betray me or have hidden intentions. \u2022 Fear of intimacy \u2013 I find it hard to express love, even to my girlfriend. Sometimes I cringe at closeness. \u2022 Cutting people off easily \u2013 If someone hurts me even slightly, I instantly want to drop them from my life. \u2022 Dissociation & numbness \u2013 I feel detached from reality at times, like I\u2019m watching life from a distance. \u2022 Lack of discipline & motivation \u2013 I struggle with school, focusing, and getting things done, even though I want to improve. \u2022 Self-sabotage \u2013 When things go well, I mess them up, and I don\u2019t know why. \u2022 Deep trauma & family issues \u2013 My father is extremely controlling and emotionally abusive. He gaslights me, threatens me, and denies all responsibility. My mother shifts between understanding me and siding with my father. \u2022 Repressed childhood stress \u2013 I don\u2019t remember huge parts of my past, but I know I was mistreated emotionally.", "1jepa6u": "Something is wrong with me and every disorder I read seems like a perfect fit So what is it, me?

My memory feels weird and fake and I don't feel like a human being and never have. I'm bad at social interaction, I'm bad with executive function, I'm bad with sensory input, I'm bad with auditory processing. I don't know what I like, i don't stand up for myself, I'm terrified of everything new December and January were the worst depressive months of my life, I've never felt that low and disgusting before. Then, randomly, 2 weeks ago I suddenly had tons of energy and started getting 12k steps a day and working out every other day and controlling myself w my calories. But also all I can think about is losing weight!!! I can't tell if it's a hyperfixation, a manic episode, or an eating disorder because I barely have the appetite for 800 cal a day even with all the activity I've been doing, and haven't been able to sleep for longer than 6hrs a night for the past two weeks. I'm way more productive and social and forward, but I'm also way more reckless and I have noticed myself feeling violently angry when I haven't been that way since I was like 15. I'm even getting annoyed at my boyfriend for doing harmless things, which has never happened!! But I haven't been to a doctor in like 8 years and do not have insurance and I am fucking terrified of the doctor's anyway. I feel like I'm gonna do everything wrong and answer every question wrong and my doctor is gonna be a terrible person who believes people with uteruses can't feel pain and should weigh 100lbs. I feel like they're only going to say I'm fat and all of my mental issues are all in my head and I'm clearly just too lazy to handle the real world. I feel like they're going to tell me i'm pregnant or have cancer or ask to look at my genitals. I feel like they're gonna tell me I need to get needles in my flesh for one reason or another. I feel like I'm gonna have a panic attack about absolutely nothing. I feel like they're gonna say there's nothing wrong with me. Besides, I'm poor as hell and couldn't handle a full time job anyway since we're too poor for a second car (bf works full time) and I'm too afraid to drive anyway. I struggle SO hard with understanding my own emotions beyond just \"bad\" and can't easily recognize patterns in my own body and mind because it all just feels like constant random painful chaos. How am I supposed to figure out if I'm having a manic episode, and wether all the energy to fix my life that I have now just disappears on me one day, and I get fat and lazy again??? I'm so on edge and can't stop thinking and talking about politics, either, and NONE of my old hobbies hold my interest anymore. Everyone is an annoying asshole who needs to get the fuck out of my way right NOW. I feel like a crazy person with this barely controllable anger. I can't sleep or eat worth a damn!! I've slept an average of 5 hours over the last 2 weeks, never getting more than 6 1/2, and I can't eat well either. I get full to the point of nausea really quickly and so many food items are suddenly gag-inducingly repulsive even if I would not have minded before. Of course none of y'all can tell me what's wrong with me, but I don't feel like reading a list of symptoms on WebMD is gonna make me feel anything other than \"omg i have all those symptoms!!\" So if anybody by some miracle has put up with me for this long; if you have any of these disorders, do these things happen to you?", "1jesu2n": "I have violent mood swings, but I'm not sure what illness it could be.

These started a year or 2 ago, I'm almost 19 now. This has also been paired with violent depersonalization and derealization that is almost constant, as well as a concerningly low amount of self care, feeling burnt out all the time, and being unable to sleep constantly because of raging thoughts.

No matter how hard I try to avoid the same mistakes or disasters, they keep happening over and over again. I need help, and I am trying to find the right help. I am tired of getting angry and walking out on my job. You see I keep having these panic attacks. I get angry and do things out of impulse without thinking about it. I would get so angry that I would walk out of my job. Sometimes, I would smash and break things on the way out. Sometimes I would just walk out. I always have a hard time getting along with others or the managers. I always feel like an outcast no matter what I do or try.

And what do you do about it?", "1j5ctbv": "Moral OCD/Paranoia Disorder??? I'm not sure this is the right subreddit for this but here I go. My entire life I've felt responsible for how everyone around me feels. I'm constantly worrying that I did something wrong or \"immoral\" to someone I care about (or something \"wrong\" in general), and when I do, my whole world falls apart and I feel horribly anxious and paranoid that that means I'm no longer a good person when I've spent my life believing and trying to reflect that. I can't rock the boat in school either. I've always been a good student and seen almost as a \"teacher's pet\", and even the thought of ruining that is terrifying because to me, that teacher would hate me and I'd ruin my reputation. Mistakes terrify me too, specifically with social situations. In 7th grade, a former friend and I got into an argument with each other, and I let my mouth run to anyone wanting to know what happened. It's been almost 4 years since that and I still feel like she resents me (when she's been nice to me) and that deep down, people still think I'm that idiotic 12 year old. I feel like everyone is almost \"out to get me\" in a way, even my closest friends. I'm scared the people who know me secretly hate me or are talking shit behind my back. A little bit ago, my bsf's ex said that ny bsf was shit talking me, and I believed her because I know that she can be nasty towards the people she doesn't like and doesn't even distance herself from those people either. I ended up confronting my bsf about it after she asked why I blocked her and she denied everything and was genuinely taken aback by it. We cleared things up in the end, but I worry that she hates me for believing her ex, or that I was stupid for believing her ex and that means I'm a bad friend/person. I also internalize every mistake I make and try to avoid them at any cost. For instance, I used to be so terrified of driving simply because I was mortified of making a mistake on the road. Yesterday, I accidentally ran a crosswalk in a parking lot because there was no sign and I was about to just stop the car and make one of my parents drive because, in my head, \"I fucked up. I can't do this. I can't believe I made a mistake. I upset everyone because I did that\". Not only that, but it's literally like everytime I make a mistake or don't know something, I actually, genuinely upset people. When I ran that crosswalk, my parents immediately got loud and yelled at me, especially my dad who just has to dwell on everything that goes wrong. And it's been like that since I was young so I get that the mistake thing may be like a trauma response or something like that. But it still makes me wonder if I developed a disorder because of it. I'm a maladaptive daydreamer, so who knows if I have something else. The reason I bring up moral scrupulosity OCD is because I identify with a lot of the symptoms and compulsions such as: - Feeling responsible for others' wellbeing - Seeking reassurance about moral issues - Avoiding situations that could cause conflict (and make me feel immoral/like a bad person) - Excessively apologizing for a mistake or conflict (and then feeling bad for apologizing because it makes me think the other person thinks I'm being manipulative, though that's specific to me) - Constantly wondering if I did something wrong - Excessive guilt I have another, specific compulsion/ritual (at least I think it's that) where, if I were to put my empty sandwich bag or other garbage by someone, it would make them think that I think I don't like them or think of them as garbage. I don't know what's wrong with me and I'm sorry if I offend anyone diagnosed with these disorders.

For most of my life, since around the age of 8 or even younger, I\u2019ve always displayed OCD symptoms. I can\u2019t remember the exact age, but at one point in my life, I became extremely health-conscious and also terrified of the FBI taking me away from my family. For the health-conscious part, I would think that I had literally any disease\u2014I thought I had cancer, brain tumors, etc. Every single day, if I felt something off, I looked up my \u201csymptoms\u201d and researched the diseases I convinced myself I had. I would constantly have panic attacks, thinking I would die soon, and I was just extremely exhausted. Over time, I gradually stopped, although I still get anxiety when I get sick\u2014I think I\u2019ll die every time I do. A small snippet of other things I experienced is that I used to get intrusive sexual thoughts, which made me extremely uncomfortable. It lasted only for a year, but I thought I\u2019d include it here. During the health-conscious paranoia, I also thought the FBI was after me. I was naive when I was younger and went on some weird websites, which made me think the FBI would come after me. With those thoughts, every single day, I believed the FBI was watching me. For some reason, a lot of helicopters flew over my neighborhood, so I thought they were after me. Every time I saw one, I was terrified for my life. At some point, I even thought my best friend was an FBI agent trying to gather my personal information! Those obsessions stopped after three years. Then, my obsessions shifted to thinking my loved ones would die every day, followed by religious guilt. The fear of my loved ones dying lasted only two years but was definitely a more intense obsession. When my friends didn\u2019t respond to my messages, I would check every social media account they had just to see if they were active anywhere, making sure they were alive. If they were inactive for 3+ hours, I would be in extreme panic for however long they didn\u2019t respond. When my parents went to the store, I would think they had died if they took too long or didn\u2019t answer my texts. The religious obsession didn\u2019t last long, but every day, I thought I was going to go to hell because I didn\u2019t fully align with \u201choly\u201d values, and I\u2019m not the most religious person. I tried researching whether certain things that don\u2019t align with Christian values would send me to hell\u2014which some sources said they would! This made me extremely paranoid. I still think about this sometimes, but not as often now. The same goes for my other obsessions; they aren\u2019t constant anymore. Right now, I don\u2019t know where I\u2019m at. Most of the symptoms stopped in December of last year. I feel so empty. I was so close to finally getting therapy, but everything just stopped. I\u2019m pretty sure this isn\u2019t an OCD symptom, but I\u2019ll put it here anyway\u2014I\u2019ve been fixated on OCD itself. Every day, I think about OCD, and I look up the symptoms every other day. I just can\u2019t stop thinking about OCD itself. It started around January. I convince myself that I have OCD, but at the same time, I convince myself that I don\u2019t. So I constantly look up symptoms and talk to ChatGPT about it (which is embarrassing, but it\u2019s a way I reassure myself) OCD runs on my mom\u2019s side, and almost everyone has it, I don\u2019t know if I do but soon I will get the support I need.

I wouldn\u2019t say the thoughts are persistent to the point were it is cause for concern, but often just taking a look around me I feel like the things my eyes are seeing are some sort of video game render, or picture. My vision is sort of \u201eflat\u201d. There are times when it really gets to me though. I realize looking back I also had a period of this last year. At some point it must have gone away, and I guess it\u2019s back now. In September of last year I made a decision do cut down my weed consumption to just the weekends, thinking it was brought on by the weed. I started smoking when I was a young teen, smoked regularly throughout my mid teens and everyday, quite consistently, between ages 17-19 (for reference I turn 20 in a couple of weeks). I\u2019ve also had my fair share of coke, molly, lsd, shrooms. Is it possible that I\u2019ve cooked my brain? I\u2019m trying to think back to when I first had that feeling of \u201ewhy does everything look like it\u2019s a game.\u201d It was after I had taken xanax for the first or second time at the age of 14. Something just seemed off about my sight, or my perception, it\u2019s very hard to explain in other terms then my vision being video game like. Basically this is the feeling I have practically all the time now. Back then it probably lasted a day or two. It\u2019s really difficult to explain this feeling so im hoping someone here has had a similar experience and knows what im talking about. The thing is I can\u2019t really remember what it was like before that feeling, our without it. I guess I would like to get back to that since it is when life seemed more \u201ereal\u201d. Even though as I mentioned before this seems to come in waves, I\u2019ve noticed myself questioning the reality I live in more and more. Anyways, to wrap this up: can someone please tell me what\u2019s wrong with me and give some tips on how I can get better?

It became quite a constant part of my life. So basically at around 15 I managed to get a hold of it and it went away while I was going through my late teens to mid-late 20\u2019s.

I'm a 17 year old guy. I already have a plan to get out of this neglectful filthy environment. In currently studying my drivings test and planning on getting a car and my driver's license with my parents by the time I turn 18, and when I'm 18, I'm immediately applying to job corps to catch up on the years of school I'm behind on, but I'm mainly going to be able to get out of this environment asap. But I'm still very worried because the ONE disease I'm having anxiety about is of course the most rare incurable disease out there, Prions. Please don't click off yet. I'm not an idiot, I realize how rare this disease is. But my environment that consists of being a very unsanitary farm with dog and cat feces and urine present in and outside the house constantly, unvaccinated animals, AND irresponsible parents that don't feed COWS we have correctly, which is literally where you most commonly get prions from an environment, my fears are atleast valid. My arm has been twitching recently sometimes, and body twitching is a symptom so obviously I'm even more worried. And my memory is lowkey bad. The house is so fucking filthy. And since we don't have fixed cats and dogs, there is literally dog period blood just on the floor as I'm walking around the house. And since the many big dogs we have in the house are untrained, we let them use the bathroom on 4 puppy pads that are washed in the washer we all use for laundry. I'm so uncomfortable I don't touch anything outside of my own room without washing my hands. I only eat the food I prepare so I make sure everything that touches it is clean, and I genuinely don't feel hopeful or happy for the future. I'm convinced I'm going to die before I get to leave this place. I'm pretty convinced there's a chance I have prions, and I'm just hoping if I do the incubation period is long enough so after turn 18 I can go get tested and see if I can test if I have prions so I can begin treatment before prions start to damage me, but with how long I've been living in this place, I feel like I'm going to start dying soon. I get it's rare. 1/6000 people get it. But living in an environment like this, irresponsible parents, plus with cows getting into coops/and maybe being fed the wrong food that's not specifically for cows, I don't see how I won't be the 1/6000. I'm probably not going to stop worrying about prions until I get tested, but until then, I hope anyone here can give me some good news that's something other than \"it's rare.\" Yes, it's rare, for normal households. Not to mention, lots of animals have died here before due to unfixed cats having kittens that have died, and a few months back, the kitten was eaten in half in the garage by the other cats or kittens for whatever reason. I guess because it was dying. And I buried it. For all I know now the cats got prions from eating their own kind, and there are prions on the garage floor. There's also plenty of feces in the garage floor in some places.

I should mention that I was diagnosed with ADHD at a young age and was prescribed medicine as a child but was eventually taken off as I approached middle school due to it getting, \" better\" as iv gotten older. My family has no history of Schizophrenia or any mental illness apart from ADHD. So why do I feel the way I feel? Why do I dream the way I dream? Why do I think the way I think? Why does everything correlate with each other? Iv had these weird dreams that lead into each other. Dreams. If you could even call them that. More like nostalgic nightmares. I say nostalgic because it's feel like I belong there in a weird way, horrific yet comforting depending. Why? Why do I feel that way about it. Some of the dreams I would record and look at from a logical standpoint. As there is a lot of ways you can tell if your dreaming. Things such as not being able to tell time, reading/ lack of comprehension skills, lack of control ect. All of which seem to add up. Yes. Just typical Dreams I believe. Shortly after turning 15 I started having these weird vibrations in the center of my head when I played down to go to sleep. Iv have had them before but not like this. Not all of the time but every so often. Skeptic? Ik. I don't blame you I am to. I still don't believe anything I feel regarding this is real. I don't believe that I'm special or that I experienced some sort of,\" awakening\". During these vibrational periods over a while I've Been able to get that feeling on command but only while laying down. When I give it to that vibration it spreads from my head to the rest of my body especially my finger tips. From there if I give into It ill end up asleep but in this world. The dreams I have don't feel like dreams. Call them lucid if you want but this still doesn't check out. None of the former rules apply anymore. I can read, I can understand and communicate, I have control of myself but not the people around me. But there are two things that's always stood out to me. One pain in this,\"place\" ,\"state of mind\",dream\" whatever is very real mental and physical. Two unlike typical dreams when you die in this place instead of waking up it take you somewhere else. The most considering part about that is it's always the same places. Another thing I should mention is that in this place I have never seen anyone that I know personally like in dreams. My mom, dad, family friends nothing. Just strangers. Some kind, some not so much, some completely unhinged, and some not even human. Extremely horrific beings. As well as emotions I can't explain nor feel in the real world. As a child I grew up with a religious grandfather, my mother and step father. My mother believed in demons, angles ect. My dads always been Skeptical. And my grandfather that goes without saying. When I was around 8 years old we lived in this house. location lexington Kentucky, Jackson Street \u2010--\u2010--\u2010- A house with a lot of questionable history we didn't know of. Iv never really believed in demons, or anything like that for the longest. Maybe my it was my childish imagination or maybe I saw something I wasn't supposed to. I would see shadows around the house, back door constantly slamming in the kitchen throughout the night, and distorted voices and stepping sounds coming from the kitchen not just a night but also throughout the day. I went to the school near there at the time William wells brown. A great school and as much as I love my parents going to school was the only good thing I would look forward to due to the amount of dread I would feel the moment I walk into that horid house. The worst part is no one would believe me until a month in and it started getting worse my dad went from Skeptic to full believe. My mom and dad own a boxed wooden dresser well over 200lbs quite literally impossible for a draft to knock over. Until one night my mom and dad where laying in bed then they said it flipped over. My dad was the first out of the bedroom leaving my mom behind out of fear lol. From here on out things got even worse. At the time my cousins where staying with me. We feel asleep in my room on the floor. That same night woke up unable to move that was my first time experiencing sleep paralysis as you could imagine I was terrified. After what felt like 5 mins I could move but when I looked upon the wooden stand we had that held the whatnotts/ dolls we had that hung from the wall. There was one corrupted doll in particular that didnt look the same. What was once a piggy bank dog animal that my uncle had won for my mom via carnival game. Was now a dreadfull, black eyed, clearly in distressed baby doll with what looked to be wearing a bid and a dirty ripped bonnet. At this moment even though I wasn't sleeping this was the first time I had felt that same vibration I felt when I got older. Apart from my head and shoulders vibrating like crazy I was overwhelmed with adrenaline, dread, and disgust. While still maintaining eye contact with the entity I tried tapping my cousin next to me to wake up. When he did wake up, he couldn't really understand what I was trying to tell him until I told him again and again to look up. Eventually I gave up and bolted out of the room. He followed soon after with a scream. I'm not sure if he ran and screamed because I left him in a dark room by himself or because he saw what I saw but whenever I did ask him he swears he doesn't remember. That same scream my cousin let out ended up waking both mine and his parents. I then started to explain what happened to and what it looked like. If I had to describe as a of today I would say it looked almost like the baby that fell from the celling from Trainspotting. Soon after that we moved out. We need up moving to a house right across the street from this one. Same street name, cover store, school and all. But this time the issue wasn't the house. As i said before my grandfather is a religious man. And so he always took me to church with him on Sundays. I loved Sunday school. Even though i was a bad kid and usually ended up in trouble. But this particular day we ended up get someone new. A girl who appeared to be around my age. But something was off about her something I didn't like. In Sunday school we had a small room all of the kids would go into it had coloring books, TV, a table and chairs that went all around it. At this table we all sat at and around lunch time is when they introduced her. We she came in she was wearing black shoes, white old fashioned leggs that led into a white dress. She had brown hair and her skin was extremely pale and abnormal, glossy like almost like a doll, like she was made out of plastic. From the moment they brought her in i Immediately wanted to do nothing more than leave. I experienced that same vibration again only this time another feeling came along with it. Canny? This was my first time ever experiencing a canny valley like ordeal. I was still a kid so I had no idea what I was feeling at the time. It was just abundance of fear and I felt trapped in that small room with her. She didn't look human but for someone reason I must have been the only in the room that felt that way because no one look bothered. After a few minutes of being around her I feel sick to my stomach and immediately made and excuse to my Sunday school teacher that I needed to use the bathroom. That was a lie. As soon as I left the room I booked it up there stairs into the main room where my grandfather was. He asked me why I wasn't in Sunday school and I told him why. He proceed to call me silly and laughed. He then gave me a hug grabbed my hand and walked me back down the stairs back to class. When my pops and me walked into the class he got a look at the girl and then turned around and gave me and strange unnerving look. A face I had never seen before. He then grabbed my hand once more and led me back up stairs with him. He turned back to look at me once again but this time he had a distraught look in his face almost as if a tear was about to fall from his eyes. Which is saying a lot because iv only seen my pops cry twice in my life. He's a tough man that has been through a lot. He kept me up there with him until the last 5 mins of the main service was left then walked me out to the parking lot and we left. He still goes to that same church till this day but he took a couple weeks break from that one after that day. When I got older I eventually asked him what happened. The first time he act like it never happened. The second time he told me somethings are just better left alone. That was the last vibrational feeling I had until after I turned 15. To be honest I'm not really all that religious I believe in a god but I skeptical of a lot of things. For one the vibrations I feel. That may be some mental issues but idk. If so I would love to heard some thoughts. And for the record I have zero TBIs. All my mental and physical medical records are clean.

Is it genetic? My father was always an anxious person\u2014stressing over things others wouldn\u2019t. He used to hit me almost every day until the 9th or 10th grade. I couldn\u2019t fight back. As I grew older, I became toxic too. I started taking out my anger on my mother. The cycle of abuse continued until one day, I cut off contact with my father. He stopped abusing me, but I couldn\u2019t stop myself from physically harming my mother. It became a part of our daily lives, and I know that\u2019s not normal. The worst part? Outside my home, I\u2019m a completely different person. I don\u2019t bully anyone. I don\u2019t get into fights. But the moment I step inside, I become someone else. I hate it. Sometimes, I feel like ending my life. But I don\u2019t want to die. I still believe I can turn things around. I just don\u2019t know how. I want to be loved. I want to be a good person. I want to be happy. The happiest time in my life? When I was dating my ex. That was the first time I truly fell in love. I\u2019ve been in relationships before, but this was different. I felt so joyful, so alive. And strangely, that was the period when I masturbated the least. My lust disappeared. I respected her so much that I couldn\u2019t even think of her sexually, especially in the beginning. It felt like divine love\u2014love without lust. I was obsessed with her, ready to do anything for her. But in the end, she ruined me. She cheated on me too. So, what is it? Can love heal me? Or is it something I have to fix on my own? Am I like this because I\u2019ve spent years stuck inside my room with no social life? I didn\u2019t go to a regular college. After high school, I just stayed at home. Could that be the reason my mental health is so bad? Would having more sexual experiences help? I don\u2019t know what to do. I believe in God. I pray all the time, asking for relief, for happiness, for peace. But I\u2019m still suffering. I just want to sit by the beach, watch the sunset, feel the breeze, and relax. But my mind won\u2019t let me. Even as I write this, my anxiety is telling me something terrible is about to happen. That I\u2019ll get diagnosed with some awful disease. That my worst fears will come true. And if that happens, what will I do? Cry? Give up? Live in misery forever? I don\u2019t know. But I do know I need to change. I need to save myself. I just don\u2019t know where to start. If you\u2019ve read this far, thank you. Please, any advice or suggestions would mean a lot.", "1jeeqk7": "My fear of going crazy has taken its toll on me. I\u2019m 34, F.. I have been dealing with fear of developing schizophrenia, schizoaffective psychosis, delusion & hallucination since i was 27. I have been to different psychiatrist and I was on and off with Escitalopram 10mg. Right now it is my third time retaking escitalopram after long period being stopping medication. It\u2019s my second day restarting it and I\u2019m not happy and feel so much panic and anxiety. I know posting here on reddit may not be a good idea but I really want to vent out. My major concern is the loud intrusive thought that sounds more like mind chatter and mental images/scenarios in my head whenever I tried to sleep and during a severe anxiety episode. I always get these whenever I close my eyes and it usually stops the moment I open my eyes. Usually it doesn\u2019t bother me esp when I\u2019m really tired but when I have heighten anxiety and panic episode. It caused me so much distressed and anxiety. The voices that i have in my head are like internal chatters that says random words or phrases. Most of the time they sound familiar and it sometimes accompanied by vivid images. The way I would describe it is like watching a video playing in your head. It\u2019s like dreaming while your still fully awake. Other times, I hear song loop usually chorus. I\u2019d also hear my name being called. Sometimes it was a faint scream or yell when I\u2019m about to sleep/have shallow sleep and when I was awaken by panic attack. Sometimes the images are disturbing that I refused to sleep because it cause me so much distress cos I feel like I am schizophrenic and experiencing psychosis. I read article, tiktok video and post about people experiencing internal auditory hallucination and closed-eyed hallucination very similar to my own. And they it is a symptoms of schizophrenia now my mind is convince that I have it. I feel like sinking. There are times when I am constantly thinking about my symptoms almost 24/7 that I trigger my anxiety and I started having disorganized word salad train of thoughts where my mind would send me gibberish thoughts/words that doesn\u2019t make sense and it would caused me so much distress. And whether I happen to think or imagine positive/negative scenarios my mind would automatically think it\u2019s delusion.. I keep constantly asking myself what if I start believing in my thoughts. What if i experience delusions? What if I start having psychosis. What if my meds don\u2019t work anymore. When I read about symptoms of schizophrenia or psychosis being not able to process a thought or having different thought that doesn\u2019t make sense it sent me into a downward spiral. I have become so fearful and scared of almost everything. I get scared when I get intrusive thoughts. I get scared when I stutter or paused when I speak. I get scared when I get mental block or forget things. I get scared when I had typo when I text. When I watch a video about prodromal psychosis or read about it, my mind think i have it. And not just that. I\u2019d even feel the sensations and symptoms starts showing up. I have become hyperaware and sensitive with what i hear. Even the tiniest noise. With what i see that I need to double check. Lately even I become sensitive to smell that when I smell something bad even the slightest my mind would question whether I am the other one who can smell it. When I hear even the fainting noise, I\u2019d try to look for the source. Sometimes I get scared looking or watching videos because I was scared I might start believing it. I have been avoiding messaging my friends because I\u2019m scared I might send them crazy stuff. Sometimes I get scared being out in public bcos I kept thinking what if I start acting crazy. Heck I even got scared looking at posters and billboard even though it\u2019s not scary. I feel like I am experiencing paranoia. I can\u2019t sleep cos I can\u2019t stop thinking about it.

Many times in my life I've had these 'episodes' where my visual perception of things is really weird.

It's the same thing with my hand, it looks like it's several feet away even if it's only a few inches.

The episodes usually last about 15 minutes and vary in intensity, this one time it was more extreme than usual, a piano that was about 4-5 feet away looked like it was the size of a shoe.

Vent Hey Reddit, I know the internet is not always the best tool for a mental health diagnosis but I no longer suffer from these symptoms and haven\u2019t for some time so even a false diagnosis would cause no harm, I just want answers out of curiosity. As a child I had severe anger issues, a problem with compulsive lying even if it got me in more trouble than the truth, and whenever my mom would explain to other people how awful I could be I would always act like an angel in public and have great manners but only act bad in my house, I also went through a pyromaniac phase at 11. Not sure if those traits are gonna help towards a conclusion but maybe they will so just dropping that info. I can\u2019t remember the dreams but I remember feeling impending doom after waking up from them and my mom would come in my room and in the middle of the night and said she woke up to me yelling and scratching the wall which I didn\u2019t even know was possible from night terrors. I also up until I turned about fifteen would always see \u201cshadow people\u201d frequently but not clearly, always in my peripheral vision and couldn\u2019t make it out, I\u2019d see the silhouette of a dark figure opening my closed door and then look at my door and my doors still closed and stuff like that. I also valued pets like my dogs just as much if not more so than I did people and still do, I was hard to control so was mostly in my room grounded from 6- 13 years old with my books and my dogs to keep me company so they became my company. I grew up with a single mom working two jobs who was gone before I woke up and home after I was asleep, but we lived with her old friend who we would find out to be a severely sick narcissist, when my mom wasn\u2019t home she would give me the \u201c slap you and give you candy\u201d treatment. Never physically, but emotionally, she would tell me my mom didn\u2019t believe in me, but she did pretty much, and just wanted to feed into the idea of me hating my mom and liking her as an ego thing. She was a compulsive liar as well who even ate all my Halloween candy one year and blamed it on me so my mom got mad at me since I had an eating disorder. My traits developed around the same time we moved in with her, were these learned from her or was I just this way as a kid. No doctors could give my mom a definitive diagnosis and they just gave me a bunch of treatment drugs like lithium to calm me despite having no idea what was wrong with me. At around 14 I started to lose my anger, and the only thing that made it leave was sadness, because of all the stress I caused my mom and nights she spent crying after I said I hated her, I thought she hated me but it was her friend lying all those years and I felt terrible. Ever since that realization I physically can\u2019t feel \u201crage\u201d I can get annoyed but I literally haven\u2019t felt true anger since and that also worries me.

I have had a rough year where nothing really felt good, not my usual favorite mille crepes cake, not my favorite coffee, no tv show or movies or even books. I feel bored out of life and enjoyment, I even wasted my savings on a luxurious trip because I was so exhausted from life and needed something big to just wake up and the trip was amazing, I loved it but it kind of just made me want to lay on warm sand and close my eyes and stay there forever, feeling warm and my mind not having to think about anything. I just can\u2019t focus on anything, everything feels so useless, and weirdly unimportant like the price of gaz or finding a new place, leaving my job, paying taxes. I just want to hide away in a cave and just become one with nature. I\u2019m so tired of eating, having to think about it everyday, cook everyday, it\u2019s making me go insane. Showering is also such a hassle, everything feels over complicated, tiresome. I\u2019m so lethargic and over it, I don\u2019t want to die but kind of just want to fade away. I still eat, and shower and talk to friends and family, laugh, go out but my heart is exhausted. I feel like I\u2019m just waiting for them to turn to the other side so I can rest, lay down and not have to think or do anything. What is this? I somehow don\u2019t feel like this is depression because I\u2019m not really sad and I don\u2019t feel like dying either, I just want peace and I don\u2019t know how to achieve that.

I am in university and have been working on an essay for my philosophy class which was due almost a month ago. I am very ashamed of this. This is no excuse, but I have been very depressed ever since the beginning of this semester (my second semester) and have not wanted to do anything besides go on TikTok (I have tried to discipline myself by setting a screen time limit to TikTok which fails as I always end up adding time to the limit) or sleep. This is odd because I actually did very well my first semester; I suspect this change is either due to the weather changing or because I went off of a medication (clomipramine) that I had been taking for a couple months as I started to think it was ineffective. Despite feeling like this I have aimed to work on the essay a couple hours each day, though sometimes I procrastinate and do not work on it. To be completely honest I do not want to work on it because I am so slow compared to others, and I feel like I have to waste so much more time working on it, just for it to be so bad compared to others. Today I timed how long it would take for me to rephrase a quote from the text I was discussing in the essay, it took me about 48 minutes, though I did get distracted at some points. For reference here is the quote and how I rephrased it: Quote: \u201c\u2026we make an agent the more responsible the more motives we can find for his conduct.\u201d How I rephrased it: The amount of motives that are found to contribute to someone\u2019s decisions/actions justifies how responsible we find them for such decisions/actions. For example, when more motives are found behind someone's actions, we find that person more responsible for those actions. I am still in the process of getting my points together and rephrasing quotes, then I will need to create an outline, rough draft, and a final draft. It is so exhausting taking almost an hour to rephrase a quote and still be left unsatisfied by it. I hate to say it but I am so jealous of how others are able to make such amazing essays in such short amounts of time or how they can complete any schoolwork in such short amounts of time. It is so demotivating, saddening, and angering to take so long on this essay, and any schoolwork in general. I have decided to drop out of university but I am going to try my best to finish this semester passing all my classes. I am still unsure of what I want to do anyways - I do not really have anything I am interested in, or any career that I feel I would be able to succeed in. All this to say, I feel very hopeless about my future and I feel very ashamed of myself. This was just a vent really, I needed to get this out somewhere.

I spend most of my time laying in my bed. I can't sit upright in chairs because my posture is only used to laying in bed. I enjoy eating in my bed. I feel safe in my bed. When I was younger I didn't spend all my time in bed because I had friends and activities to do. I could sit upright in chairs without being in pain. I don't know how to live like that anymore. It's been almost a decade since, I'm not familiar with it. For fun I crochet in bed. I draw in bed. I watch videos in bed. I get a dopamine rush when I think about all the fun things I could do with my life. I fantasize about how good I would have it if I had friends and didn't rot away in bed everyday. I don't know if this is hope or delusion. I make an effort not to lay in bed all day sometimes. But usually it's just so comforting to lay in bed because every other alternative is so strange and unfamiliar. People tell me to just get out of bed, but I'm split between wanting to and not wanting to. I don't know what I'm supposed to do when not in bed. I could do what I do in bed while sitting in a chair instead. But then my neck and back hurts. I could go for walks but I'm so tired, and nobody wants to walk with me. I could go alone but then I might as well just be in bed. I don't feel like I exist when no one sees me. My life is on standby. I can just rot because no one will judge me. Don't get me wrong though. I don't want to have it like this. I want to be normal and be able to make friends and enjoy life outside of bed. I just don't understand how I'm supposed to.

But I don't understand preparing a meal for mealtime or brushing my teeth in the morning and evening.

I feel so so lazy. I used to be someone with ambition and drive. Now I just sit in my bed after school and on my weekends. Some days I can't even get out of bed for school. I don't want to self diagnose or anything but I think I've gone a long time with undiagnosed ADD which has caused me to spiral this past year or two because of the increased intensity and pressure in school work and struggling to get normal things done. Being in class or watching a video and barely picking up any information whilst I'm distracted and my classmates retaining that informational immediately is tiring.

I was going to the gym, in good shape, eating super good, funny and charismatic around my friends and had a great boyfriend. Then I started to get involved in arguments with my parents, getting verbally abused and screamed at in front of my face, having to run away from home. Then everything started to go downhill. Now I feel like my life is over. Although in 2021 I had gone through a similar type of episode and I think it's worse this time round. I wish there was an easy fix. I might go see my doctor finally because I just don't believe I'm depressed, my whole life I've been told others have it worse. My inability to do things makes me feel awful and is causing me to give up on everything and fantasise about suicide if only I didn't feel so bad leaving everyone behind with guilt or hatred towards me.

My social life is basically dead, and I'm not sure how to fix it. I feel so confused and numb most days, and a deep sense of sadness and frustration, also disconnect from the world in general. I hate going outside because it reminds me of how lonely I am, feels like I'm trapped in a bubble and the rest of the world is trapped in theirs. My brain is constantly yelling at me that there is no point when I do creative work, that I'm pretty much just wearing myself out and my work in general has become mind-numbing and repetitive because that's what's easiest.

This is a horrible word vomit so not all of it makes sense. In a rough place right now. I have no motivation anymore. I don\u2019t really enjoy things. In highschool, whenever I was suffering chronic depression, I started a lot of medications, (SSRI, SNRI, stimulants,) and at the time they saved my life, but I am not sure if maybe they fried my brain or something In highschool I used to be super driven to make art, I was super creative and had a lot of visions in my head. I\u2019d fill up sketchbooks constantly, start difficult projects and just constantly creating with different mediums. I wrote a ton as well, and my brain was always churning with ideas and creativity, sometimes making it hard to sleep After highschool I just started losing motivation and sleeping all the time. I probably slept a whole year away. Lost an insane amount of weight from doing nothing. I can\u2019t even really remember if I was on medication at this time or not. I think I was on anti depressants, and maybe ADHD stimulants as well. I felt happy but just preferred to sleep instead of be alive. I started working a full time job, and I didn\u2019t really feel like the medication was doing anything for me anymore, so I just stopped taking it. I didn\u2019t notice any withdrawals or anything either. Now, I work a full time job, go work out at the gym, go skate, hang out with friends, don\u2019t eat unhealthily, etc. But I have no motivation to do anything on my own, ever. I don\u2019t do laundry unless I have to clean an outfit to leave. I haven\u2019t cleaned my room in months. I haven\u2019t done all my laundry in years. My room literally looks like a hoarders room, it\u2019s so bad. I don\u2019t like to make myself food, or get gas, or get groceries. I constantly start projects and never even get halfway before abandoning them. The worst part of it is I don\u2019t create anything hardly anymore. I rarely draw. I rarely write. It is so boring and I don\u2019t enjoy it, I have to force myself to do it, even though I just really want to make art. I can\u2019t see things in my head anymore, like it\u2019s empty inside. My attention span is so terrible that I go crazy trying to focus on the project at hand for more than a couple minutes. I just sit on TikTok during any and all of my free time because it\u2019s the only thing I have the capacity for. In the distant past I have suffered short manic episodes in which I would suddenly clean everything, start spending all my money and not be able to sleep at night for several days. Sometimes I go through bouts of paranoia where I start to think about death and get so genuinely freaked out I can\u2019t think straight and do or say stupid things I tried weed to see if it would bring back any kind of creativity (probably a few months ago), and it hasn\u2019t caused any problems that weren\u2019t already there. I only indulge maybe once a week or every two weeks, to reset stress that builds up from work. Even then I don\u2019t get fried. If I just stop taking it, nothing changes other than not getting to have a decompression hangout night. I don\u2019t feel any smarter and my memory doesn\u2019t get any better, and I don\u2019t feel withdrawals or like I need it. Just a little sad I can\u2019t turn my brain off for a couple hours. My short term memory also stresses me out, it\u2019s really bad, but it was like that before I even looked at weed, it started getting horrible right after highschool like I said. Same with my mental cognition, I am at least 1/3rd stupider now than I was in highschool, despite only having graduated 3 years ago My mental health was the absolute worst in highschool, I\u2019d have random psychotic breaks and anxious meltdowns, sleep for ~18+ hours, and yet I was at my most creative and constantly making art. I was as sharp as a whip and very perceptive. I would get so excited over things it would make me sick, and would always be looking forward to starting new projects and finishing old ones. I just want to create things I love again and I can\u2019t. I don\u2019t know where it went and I don\u2019t know how to get it back. I\u2019ve been trying supplements and schedules and it feels like I\u2019m just going to be like this forever. Like I\u2019m going to keep watching myself get stupider and less creative and my motivation just completely gone in it\u2019s entirety. Life feels really grey for me right now, like all the color has been drained from the picture. Days fly by and there isn\u2019t anything that necessarily excites me in the ways it used to, like my brain doesn\u2019t make those chemicals anymore. I don\u2019t want to live like this. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s adhd or if it\u2019s some sort of schizoaffective or autism or what, I don\u2019t know why I started mentally declining so roughly and so quickly after highschool. Am I just growing up? Is everything boring now? Did I have some sort of stroke or do i have some sort of early onset disorder? Did the medications fry my brain? Do I need to get back on all of them to function again? Was I even functioning on them in the first place? Do I have some sort of TikTok addiction which has ruined my motivation hormones? I just want to cry and sleep forever.

Let your plants die, pile up dirty clothes. It sucks. But it's warm and comforting like a nostalgia from years ago, like a weighted blanket you can't keep off of you. I used to have these kinds of episodes. On smaller scales, not super long periods of time, but I was dealing with this. Since then I've spend each and every day just clawing my way out of that blanket; forcing open the cocoon. Fight to keep myself functional, as a productive human being. I can't afford to go into a depression like this. I have a job, a life. But damnit if I'm not inclined to take a week or 2 off of work so I can fall into this again. Depression sucks.

I would make myself bowls of top ramen just to take 2 bites of it, almost vomit, and pour it out. These episodes really suck. But they're almost addictive.

Friends and family listen but they don't really hear what I am saying, and have grown tired of helping try to make sense of things. I am hurting really bad and feel like I am screaming internally all the time. So here is the story, I met this girl 14 years ago in University. It was love at first sight on my end. We had lots of little coffee dates, and walks in the parks, and around the city, but she soon got back together with her ex-boyfriend. Then broke up with him, than met another guy and eventually married him and had a child. Now this whole time I was still friends with her. When her marriage went south, she sought me out for support, eventually it grew into an affair with me. Then it stopped for no apparent reason. I did not question it, I assumed it was bad timing, she mentioned she was going to try counselling with her husband, so I backed off. Next thing I know she is dating someone and I was left very confused. But, again I decided it was just bad timing and the situation being so complex, I did not want to admit her bad nature. Several years passed with me now being held at arms length, she made it clear she did not want messages from me. I respected her wishes for the most part, never calling her or sending her more than a \"happy birthday\". During this time she left that guy and found another who became husband number 2, which she had a second child with. Fast forward to the fall of 2024, I receive a message from her, completely unprompted she informs me that marriage number 2 is ending. Now, I am older and wiser at this point, but as it turns out still completely stupid where this woman is involved. I ask her motivation for telling me this, she replies that she is just looking for friendship and support, and that she is not looking for anything romantic *\"RIGHT NOW\" (yes she actually said that)*. I acknowledge this as it makes sense, but I also make sure she understands I still have feelings for her. She confirms that she understands and says that she is not uncomfortable with me having told her that. So we begin talking, a lot *(nearly everyday)*. I start to help her understand certain elements of what she is going through *(IPV)* as it is very much related to my education. I help provide contact information for various resources and legal information for the divorce and possible custody battle over her second child. I even help with some advertising for her business. I feel I was being a true friend and support, because that is what she said she needed *RIGHT NOW*. Then the week of Valentines Day rolls around, I had this whole plan in my head for doing something small (not a date or anything) as I did not think she was at the point of starting anything new. At this point she reveals that she is going on a date Valentines weekend. As you may imagine given everything you just read this triggers me. I told her I was not aware she had started dating yet. She says that she thinks it is time and it can be just a *\"fun casual thing, nothing serious\"*. Well at this point I can't help but feel hurt, so I explain that this information has really caught me off guard due to my feelings for her and how much we've been chatting. Que the gaslighting, she tells me she had no idea I felt that way about her, and dismisses me when I show her a screenshot of me disclosing those feelings back in October.

For example I got the top of my physics class but an intro to a narrative I wrote I didn't like the way I wrote it, don't get me wrong the assignment wasn't that bad but it wasn't what I wanted and in my mind if it isn't how I want to write it I failed the subject and the assignment and I just kept thinking about it this and beating my self up and stressing about it, this happened around a week and a bit ago and I am still thinking about it. I just wish I could stop this, I don't know why I think like this and every imperfection I have thought about ending it many times before, since I was 10 if I remember correctly. I just wish it could all just stop in a sense. I pay attention to every mistake I make every day all the time. People my age usually think about getting girl friends and so on, being popular and everything. I just think about money/success all the time I stress about it so much. Everyday I am just thinking on how my life will play out. In my mind my only way of proving my worth is by getting a lot of money/success and I think of money as the only way to be happy. I try and change but it is as if my mind is split into two parts, one part is fighting with the other over a virtual control in my head and my emotions can switch easily. I wish to change but I don't know how. I feel like if I lose the fact everyone views me as smart I lose everything and there is no point anymore.

For context, I'm (19m) a sophmore in college, and it's not been going well. I've come to the hard realization that I was probably not ready at the beginning for college, and life has been in the way since square one. With my parents going through a vertiable cold war divorce, me losing pretty much all my friends, long-term emotional abuse catching up with me, a failed relationship, and constant financial issues, it's been a mess of pretty epic proportions. I'm so exhausted all the time, I can barely get motivated to get out of bed, so I've been skipping classes, even though I'm on my last chance before I'm kicked out of college. I just dunno what to do, and every day my mind just looks for the next fastest exit. I've been taking risks, small stuff at first. Intentionally not looking when crossing the street, not bothering to be safe when doing daily tasks, or just neglecting or procrastinating seeking treatment for health issues. But it's been getting worse and worse, to the point I've basically got a death wish. I know it sounds really dumb, but my experiences in the past have left a bad taste in my mouth when it comes to therapy and support services, and I am thoroughly against admission to a hospital.

My father is still supporting me financially and I feel really bad about it. I was depressed and I feel like I'm getting better that's why I'm feeling bad for not working. I'm currently going to a technical school and I'm studying because I want to go to university instead. I need therapy but I can't afford it (I was waiting for about six months for free one and I'm still waiting.) My parents know about my problems but they are telling me that I should just get over everything because it was in the past which I understand because I'm an adult and I'm responsible for myself right now. I'm giving most of the money that my father is giving me to my grandparents because I'm living with them and it's a resasenoble thing to do. I'm just really scared of working and I'm overwhelmed by everything. I'm trying to pretend that I'm fine because no one cares and I know that I should get my shit together but all of it is too much for me. A year ago I was laying on my bed unable to move and now I'm leaving the house everyday, cooking, cleaning, studying, going to the dentist, exercising and just doing the basic stuff but I feel like it's killing me.

I just feel like a terrible person who is just extremely lazy. I feel privileged because I'm still getting money from my father and I feel like a parasite.

I grew up poor with neglectful parents, with a dad that literally tried to kill me before my mom divorced him and I was removed from his care. I worked hard because I didn\u2019t want to be in poverty anymore and I wanted a happy life. Well that got me no where. I went to college got a bachelor\u2019s degree in biology and now I work at Barnes and noble where I\u2019m severely under appreciated and under paid despite how hard I work.

I want to quit my job but I can\u2019t because again I live in poverty. There\u2019s barely enough food in the house to last a week at all times. I love animals and wanted to be a vet but whats the point I\u2019ll just be in more debt then I already am an be depressed about how poorly people treat there animals. I\u2019m dating someone but it\u2019s not going anywhere because again I can\u2019t feel loved.

I\u2019m also not sure if what I\u2019m facing is depression. I don\u2019t know what I feel but my life is not the same barely any excitement but IK I\u2019m not going to kill myself but I can\u2019t explain it. My Weekdays are usually like: My mom waking me up but me just refusing till the last minute. Getting dressed quick not caring much about how I look and just sighing while looking at myself in the mirror. Quickly eating breakfast but I have many anger outburst in the morning uncontrolled I shout over small stuff. In the car it\u2019s usually me not speaking because my parents and sister are angry I am almost making them late again and I shout sometimes again. School just drags on I barely have anyone to talk to or any time to do so as we have assigned seats and strict teachers but I do talk some classes but I feel like crying sometimes from loneliness. On my A day I usually have to eat lunch with my friend which is a whole another building so I have to walk all the way there but then I also have to see her say bye to my ex friend there who hurt me by leaving me with no explanation and it hurts seeing her with her but I just shrug it off. But for the past month or two I have been staying in my building to eat lunch alone away from her because I want to be alone idk why. Then on my B days I eat lunch alone and I find it peaceful but it hurts seeing other ppl eat lunch with friends I could sit with other people and talk to them but I don\u2019t know I just can\u2019t bring myself to do it because I feel like I can finally rest. I sometimes think back to last year when everything was good when I felt better but I did stupid stuff I regret back then to but I didn\u2019t have this feeling and actually put in an effort for appearance and interactions with my friends didn\u2019t feel so forced. I still think back cry and regret what I did I went on omgel slowly got groomed slowly finally gave in sent nudes which I still regret I feel disgusted with myself. I still remember a sleepover and me and my friends uploading a snap story and my friend getting a text and him just compliment me and that I\u2019m pretty IDK all of this felt good as I was getting validation that I felt better about myself because my mom body shamed me IG. I also remember texting a guy at night he was my age and online I met him on my alt account and IG we texted every night for a few days before my mom caught me I got grounded and they took my phone away for a few days but I was ok I had my iPad. That guy was sweet but I stopped texting him and then my friends added me to this gc a bunch of bullying ig but not directed to me but I still defended stuff my dad saw it again and Ig that\u2019s when I ended my stupid online stuff and actually for the first time cleared my phone and didn\u2019t do stuff that needed to be secretive on it. I did more stuff online that might have hurt me but that was vague details ig but not to much I never showed my face and took measures but IG it somehow affected me. Then summer started I just stayed home and watched something all day on my screen and went out with my parents I was still ok but I did gain weight. I also lost the spark with my friends ig. Then the school year started though it would be the best but I was wrong and then on A days I used to sit with new people but had to leave to discuss with my friend because this friend left me and I lost those other people. And then everything just happened if felt like it repeated every day. I still wanted to look good tho and I went to school and procrastinated at home and did my work late slept late and then my health obviously isn\u2019t going to be great and my mom would be worried and I know she cares for me but she has been diagnosed with depression so IG that makes it worse for her and me and everyone in the house. It\u2019s just a lot of shouts and screams some days or should I say recently most of the days they are directed towards me and she swears calls me names and I try not to shout back cause if I do at that time it only ends with something idk what it is but she falls down screams cries and say I\u2019m going to kill my self I don\u2019t know but I barely cry infront of them and just look ig. This hurts I wish I can improve myself make my mom happy then none of this would happen my mom and my family would be much happier but my mom is suicidal and she asks me if she should leave if she should kill her self because I seemingly shout at her which I\u2019m not proud of. What makes me feel guilt just a tiny but is when I go to my friends house and they open and omgele alt and somehow I end up being praised IK those me are sick but it gives me validation however I don\u2019t do it on my own at home I know infront of my friends I wouldn\u2019t be able to do something stupid. I constantly compare myself to friends and other I have so much in my life I should be happy I really should but I don\u2019t which hurts I feel lower then everyone I just want to cry the whole day but I don\u2019t. I even stay in the room during weekend pretending I\u2019m doing work while I\u2019m on my phone as I don\u2019t know why but I just don\u2019t want to spend time with anyone while the whole week I have done nothing but that. This also causes conflict my mom shouts at me which I just hate again. I feel like dying at that movement just for me to end up in hell from all the pain I caused others around me. Not even all of this matters my grandma she came here to see me but I could get myself to be of my phone as it\u2019s my escape it drowns my memories away all the pain but why do I have it don\u2019t I have a better life then the homeless. I didn\u2019t talk much to her but she deserves my words but I didn\u2019t I feel guilt cause she came here on a plane to see us but she left now. My other grandma however doesn\u2019t care much about me Ik she somehow hurt my mom a lot cause my moms depression is caused by her and still fights between my parents would be caused by her or me but what hurts is she tell us to make a pancake for ourselves with the batter she left and she pretends she can\u2019t operate to stove and called me every single time but for her daughters children she does a lot it evident she doesn\u2019t like us much but still. Hell me even being born I made a mistake I was the last grandchild for her and I was to born girl rather then a boy like everyone wished for. Lastly I don\u2019t know what made my life like this but today also makes me question things I used to love going out and going to restaurants but now today while my mom was waking me up I didn\u2019t want to go it may not sound large but this has been happening for a few weeks it\u2019s not normal for me all I wanted was to stay at home a read a story of another person a fictional character with a better life. I wonder what would have happened if we stayed back in that country 2 years ago instead of moving to USA where in that place I could have grown and also done better in basket ball and actually play it more but I know that if I were to stay there I would have made a mistake. I would have gotten myself a bf I would have been reckless because of the people around me I would have hid it from my parents but I can\u2019t help but think that would have been better my parents would have been happier and I would have been popular still and I would have still been happy and all this is because we had to move because my sister wanted to study here. I actually was in the USA since I was born just moved there for a bit. I can\u2019t talk to my sis she tell everything to my mom and I don\u2019t want to ask anyone for academic help cause she makes me feel dumb. I know she is also just trying to help me but it hurts the way she talks. She makes me mad from just existing probably because I\u2019m jealous? She is older than me to. What worries me is will I ever make an attempt to change my life what would motivate me to make a change when I feel it not so worth it. If you can answer these question I would feel happy: I\u2019m just confused why do I want to not talk?Why do I not want to spend time with my friends why do I feel fake around them? Why do I have to have everyone hate me? Why am I letting my grades drop? Why am I letting life be bad when I can get it in control and make it better? Why do I feel it would be easier to end my life? But what is stopping me why am I not ending it? If anyone is reading this and read such a big rant thank you so much please leave a comment it may help and if you want to talk you could just DM me it\u2019s better to struggle together then alone ig make motivate each other.", "1jhq37n": "After Existential Crisis support Hi, thank you so much for clicking here. Please, if you don't have anything positive or helpful, don't reply. I don't want to view another philosophical view or some bs about nihilism. I have been dealing with a sudden Existential Crisis since last Thursday 3/13/25. This is honestly ironic as it was the day after my 15th birthday. I didn't have anything major life-changing like a breakup or whatever, but I was just suddenly questioning reality. I've had these questions like 'what is the point of life', or 'who is real', since I was very young, but I was always able to shake them off. But this time I got very invested and researched, and eventually it was to the point I was having a panic attack. I slept and the day after felt horrible. I had 0 interest in the present and just kept thinking about existence and meaning. However, over the week, I talked with GPT like a therapist (I can't afford one) and it has gotten better. I learned that what I was mostly feeling was derealization. I do feel better a week later, I don't question the abstract part as much but I'm feeling something else. This is what I wanted to ask: Although I wasn't as stressed as before about existence, I just feel empty- especially when I'm alone. I don't feel much motivation, and it feels like I'm looking out a glass window as life goes on. I hate this. I don't want to spend the rest of my life dealing with this. I wished I had never had that one thought. I normally had very strong emotions. I just almost feel depressed. I often get scared for it to turn dark because that is when I start getting anxious or depressed. If you guys had something similar, please share how you overcame it. Does it just come and go?

I\u2019ve always had online friends during this time but it wasn\u2019t that bad (until 2020 but some of the parts in here are relevant to this story) so it was maybe December 2023 and I lost my last friends in my school(I went to a small school so the only ones left were the popular kids who bullied me) I was 13 during this time and I made some close online girl friends and one guy friend. then during February 2024, those friends didn\u2019t really contact me as much and I was getting bored since a new girl came to my class during January but then suddenly stopped being my friend. so anyways, I use to play Fortnite but i didn\u2019t really like the game but heard you can find friends there so I decided to do that. I made a new account(forever thankful for) and started asking people in comment sections to add. since I was obviously a girl I thought only girls would wanna play with me but nope.. so anyways, some guys dmed me and I was a little skeptical. the first guy I\u2019ll call him mark. mark was kinda weird, like I tried to get to know him better as a friend but he was kinda dismissive and was..strange. basically, while we played I chatted to him and asked questions like, \u201cwhat\u2019s ur favourite animal?\u201d he said dog and I said cat. but then I asked him \u201cdo you wanna ask me a question\u201d and he was like \u201cidk\u201d (his favourite word) so then his friend came to play with us. after that game he told me that his friend said me and mark were good together(only knew the guy for like 2 days) later on, the guy kept ignoring me and I was getting confused. I didn\u2019t wanna be friends with someone who wasted my time. I decided to confront him with the help of another guy(James who is the chillest guy) and to wonder why he kept ignoring me. Now btw James wasn\u2019t that into the convo and I was talking to him in another chat but later he left since it was to much for him. al of a sudden mark just said he wants to be with me and I was so scared of saying no since he was low-key guilt tripping me. I decided to say yes even tho I had no feelings and didn\u2019t even know who the guy was. the relationship was weird as he seemed he just wanted to ruin my life? anyways during this time I went back to my old friend group from December(Kay, Mia, nana and Joan) and they were really invested in this. they kept telling me to act up more around mark since they thought he was funny. I faked saying I was depressed and stuff to make mark break up with me since I told my December friend group I hated mark. later on, another guy dmed me and asked to play. we did and eventually that was it. I\u2019m gonna call him Donald as this guy was so weird. so after we played we stopped talking until basically, Kay told me to find another guy to \u201cdate\u201d but I didn\u2019t tell them I wasn\u2019t into online dating. she said give it a try because she already had an online boyfriend. anyways, i decided to share videos to guys in my dms to try and \u201ctalk\u201d to them but I just sent them weird videos which that part I didn\u2019t tell Kay. anyways later on me and Donald started talking again and I thought he was actually cool and hoped I could befriend him. but nope he had a crush on me and it was obvious. so basically while I talked to him, I was bored and decided to vc him. he seemed he didn\u2019t care and sounded like a child lmao. anyways my December friend group was listening into the call with another device as everything was good. I also made friends with another guy called Dj who I didn\u2019t care about but accidentally treated him like a therapist(this part is importent) because I was going insane. boys were liking me and mark btw kept asking me to show my face and it was so annoying. I felt disgusted but my friends in December just thought it was funny to trick 12-14 year old boys. (they were like 15/16-18) anyways, a weird conversation with Donald made me hate him and basically. So this part made me think like \u201coh he\u2019s a nice guy\u201d because he told me his sister got her period recently and he felt scared and bad because she was in a lot of pain. I decided to be nice and say some stuff and he accepted it. it was until this part which I made sure to fake argue with guy friends to let them know I see them as a brother. so basically, he randomly called me \u201cflat\u201d and I was so confused so I said like \u201coh how do you know\u201d no idea why I said that but then he said this \u201cbecause my sister has bigger ones then you\u201d I was shocked and disgusted and I asked him like \u201cwdym\u201d he then said like his sister was like c cup(she\u2019s 11) and I was like \u201coh\u201d and he said that his sister will have a Z cup when shes 18. that made me hate him because why would you say that about your sister? days went on and suddenly Mark was being a a hole to me. he kept being bipolar or something by saying stuff like \u201coh I hate you\u201d and kept ignoring me. then suddenly when we were arguing, he sent a pic of a random girl. I was shocked and I found out he could be cheating(even tho I won\u2019t call that as a relationship) so anyways I told Donald about this as he said like \u201coh don\u2019t worry I\u2019ll roast him\u201d and I was like um ok. he went into my following as followed mark. they talked and stuff and I told the December friend group about this. they said Donald was being annoying(since I also told them about the sister thing) and that I shouldn\u2019t have told him that stuff. anyway. me and mark broke up(I\u2019ll like to mention me and mark fought every two days and broke up then went back together 12 times) so I was relieved I was finally \u201csingle\u201d and no other boys will annoy me\u2026 so it was my 14th birthday and I was having an actual good day being offline and not always talking to them. I started thinking that I should just lose my online friends and actually talk to people so I decided to tell all my friends that but decided to do that on Donald since I didn\u2019t care about him. so suddenly I was suspicious a lot because days before my birthday, my December friend group was debating if Donald liked me or not and Joan told me to say this to me if I get a chance. \u201cI\u2019ll hop on that instead\u201d I didn\u2019t want to and I thought it was gross but he insisted. anyways I said that and it started becoming sexual as my December friend group was having such a fun time making fun of him and giving me cringey lines to use. I was laughing honestly because I thought it was so gross. now cut to my birthday and nana said to confront Donald since she was the one I trusted out of the December friend group and seemed more.. mature? anyways I told her I didn\u2019t want online friends anymore and wanted to talk to my ex friends again as she told me just to ask Donald like \u201cwhat are we?\u201d and if he says friends that I should just tell him to leave and if he said dating that I should say I didn\u2019t want that and I\u2019m leaving anyway. so that was the plan, I asked him and he was lik \u201cwhat do you wanna be\u201d I told nana in a call privately but Joan came in randomly and dared me to say \u201cdating\u201d I didn\u2019t want to and nana said to just leave it but I said it anyway. suddenly now I\u2019m dating a boy I didn\u2019t even like. few days go by and my December friends didn\u2019t really like Donald as he was so cringe. which was true. so we started scouting for new boys for me but I didn\u2019t want any. during this Donald asked me weird question overtime and kept making weird jokes which I hated but played along. I didn\u2019t wanna make this kid sad tbh. anyway first Donald told me a weird dare that I should put my elbows together on my chest in front of everyone to prove I\u2019m not \u201cflat\u201d(he loved calling me that). I was weirded out. anyways we met another kid who is the one in most scared of called Jacob. so I started talking to him and I wish I never did because he became sexual to me right away and kept saying stuff about myself. I was so weirded out and wanted to die. I couldn\u2019t take this anymore as i remember that Donald use to send voice recordings to me and I use to record them with another app and sent them to my December friends to make fun of him. of course Donald was so weird and I hated him but he didn\u2019t deserve to be made fun of. I decided how could I make everyone leave me alone for once? I remembered in 2020 where I did something extreme and \u201cfaked my death\u201d and becoming sucidal. I couldn\u2019t take these online friends anymore as they were making me feel so negative. so I decided to send a \u201csuicide\u201d note to everyone saying I was gonna kill myself. that was terrible and back fired as Donald suddenly texted all my mutuals that I didn\u2019t talk to that I \u201ckilled\u201d myself. I was so mad because then Donald and Jacob met(worst thing ever) as they also knew where I live and Donald knew my city. I was so done and it was so annoying getting spammed that I shouldn\u2019t die. I didn\u2019t actually want to die but I wanted to get away from everyone. so then I came back and they were relieved. well only Donald and Jacob and Dj since everyone else didn\u2019t rlly care and was like \u201coh damn\u201d so as I came back I had a new mission. make everyone hate me. my December friends group for some reason I wanted to keep at that time and decided to tell them what happened as they laughed at me for being dramatic and told me if I want them to hate me then I have to act like an incel. I already acted like that before but I felt it was too much. anyways during this time Donald made more weird jokes about his sister. basically we were talking about how me and Jacob don\u2019t gain weight and Donald said he did. anyways he then said he wished he was his sister because she gained weight \u201cin the right places\u201d me and Jacob, it felt like we actually looked at eachother and at him as Donald kept saying she had a nice butt and boobs. it was so weird and I recorded it all and showed it to the December friend group as they had a blast. so anyways, during this I\u2019ll like to say Jacob had a crush on me and I didn\u2019t tell Donald. I thought that maybe this could make me untrustworthy and Donald would leave me alone. so nothing happened sadly anyways Jacob and Donald fought a lot and I just wanted to leave. I\u2019m gonna say that I missed actually talking to my real classmates and during this time I just ignored them and acts mean and emo to them. we had alot of beef between as and this was my last school year with them and I wished we could\u2019ve all sorted this out. then there was a time where Kay dared me to send \u201cnoods\u201d to Donald. I didn\u2019t want to and she said that she will edit it and to make sure it won\u2019t actually show anything and they wont find me. honestly I was actually flat so I actually sent Kay a real photo of my chest with a bra and she edited it and told me to send it to Donald. I was scared and regretted this immediately. I sent it and now, Donald had a photo of my chest. Since Jacob liked me I sent a photo to which I didn\u2019t even think about. anyways then I met a new guy named Connor and I decided that I can finally leave Donald and Jacob because Connor liked me and even tho I didn\u2019t, maybe I could\u2026cheat? the thing is my online group from 2020 hated me because I was a cheater and never talked to me again. not sure if they are still friends or smth but I did tried talking to them again under a fake name but obviously I just thought \u201cmaybe it\u2019s for the better\u201d and left. I decided maybe I can make them hate me and they would leave me like how everyone else does. I decided to have some thing with Connor as a side relationship and I saw from Mia\u2019s relationship which she showed us that once her boyfriend found a new guy, he immediately ghosted her, ignored her and was being dismissive towards her: I tried that and it was working until they confront me. for some reason I mention I was talking to Connor and then Donald went ahead and dmed him. they started talking and out of nowhere and Jacob kept saying stuff racist stuff. during this time irl, I caught feelings again for my classmate who I really liked for a while and since this day everyone was busy. I realized how much fun I was having without online friends and how being outside was actually fun.. so I decided to have some time for myself and make one of my friends pretend to be me. for me being dismissive and rude I was really bad at it so I gave Joan all my socials account passwords. if it was messages I just copy pasted what he sent me to say to them. during this time, I met a girl and she was pretty cool. she was new to this school and when I talked to her we liked the same stuff like Taylor swift, Roblox and kdramas. I liked talking to her and it was so fun taking troll pictures of our classmate who she had a crush on for sure. stuff was going great until Joan had to leave and I had to talk. a small recap was givin to me as I decided to talk to those guys again. I was honestly done with this cycle and just wanted to talk to my real friends. as we were talking, I also gave Donald a few days back my social account passwords and since he noticed I was being more meaner, he looked though my messages(fyi, this entire time I had a burner account to talk to Donald,Jacob,Connor etc so nobody knows about the December friend group) anyways Donald saw my messages and I only had nana and Mia with me. I was a little scared but nana said this could be my time to leave those guys. basically I told them I didn\u2019t want anything to do with them and I\u2019m breaking up and I never wanna talk to them again. I decided to block them and it was fine until. overtime Jacob kept making alt accounts to text me aswell as Dj (as I stopped being friends with him too) and Donald. then Connor was scared and found out that Donald knew it this was just so messy. I\u2019m a little thankful for nana and Mia for helping me deescalate this situation. anyways it was the last days of school and I started ignoring everyone even Connor who also kept begging me for a face reveal. it was a week before grad and I had a fun time with my class and I decided to block everyone and I mean everyone and start new. but Jacob found me again and this is what was making me scared this whole time he told me that he was gonna expose me and leak my \u201cnoods\u201d even tho they were fake, I was so scared and I didn\u2019t want anybody finding out as btw, since they have my phone number, my class tiktok account leaked and Jacob messaged my classmates. I\u2019m just so scared my classmates might find out about this and I hope they haven\u2019t.Anyways I had the last day with my class and everyday I wish I can go back and actually make an apology to my classmates because we were all in the wrong but nope. my entire time was taken up by online friends. during these few months, Mia,Joan,nana and Kay were a little mad and Kay kinda threaten my with the chest pic but she didn\u2019t know about my classmates and when I told them all I was done. they were mad and said they didn\u2019t care. but nana messaged me privately and told me good luck and not to worry because it\u2019s not like Jacob will fly out to my country and do stuff. I just hope they would leave me alone.even tho they did threaten me and also Jacob did see my face by mistake on call since he always wanted to call me. I was just scared but then I got over it. until now when someone messaged me and I got ptsd and flashbacks. I also had a dream that Jacob leaked everything and I was the laughingstock of tiktok. It was just weird because I thought I forgot about them. anyways I\u2019m so glad I let this out and to anybody reading this, please reassure me or tell me something and what you thought. it\u2019s so long but I hope you guys can help me. (I\u2019ll like to mention Jacob and Donald and Connor were racist aswell as Kay and mark, they are homophobic, transphobic etc and always said every slur in the book, I also only talked to them becaue I was bored and I thought(okay it shouldn\u2019t be that bad they would leave me right? like how everyone else does and it\u2019s just until the summer break. it was only because nobody talked to me during school and I was bored so I needed a friend.) thank you for listening and lmk if I was in the wrong or if this is just something for me to laugh at years later.", "1jhhe96": "Don't know what to do anymore 19m.

Hey there people. Hope your all having a good day/ evening, wherever you are inside this big blue bubble. I have a question for some people on here, where ever in the world they are. As someone without a disability, why do people judge me as someone that would be stupid just for having a disability? How can I truly feel happy after I\u2019ve been alone for so long? I have barely 1st stage autism, it has gone away drastically since I was little, but ever since I was little, I always had no idea how to talk to people. I drive, read, and I\u2019m trying to become a computer engineer, but i also tried to be a game designer and developer, my childhood dream. I found out programming for me in game design would not be nice for me. Broke my heart, had to switch to something else completely, I was shy, quiet and wasn\u2019t for a long time, but once again i am, due to some extremely poor friend suggestions and behavior completely on their part, which I feel have ruined my happiness completely out of my life. I was blackmailed by my friend group I met with my buddy from elementary. They accused my account with an easy to guess password, and exposed me and my girlfriend\u2019s private chats all for everyone to see. With the whole kit and kabob if you know what I mean in those types of things in a relationship via messages when two people love each other. Was bullied so badly in school I literally felt like I had to act stupid all the time, just to make friends. I hate I did this, if I just kept being myself and I had more strength and courage, I could\u2019ve been done with it all. But I didn\u2019t. Now, have a large former group of Friends now making fun of my body, my decisions and my poor choice actions, get told to end my life, we aren\u2019t your friends, get the fuck away from me, or fuck off. Try to always act like it\u2019s not a big deal shit they say, I don\u2019t care, it\u2019s all online shit on game chat it doesn\u2019t matter bro, your a pussy. Makes my teeth begin to get locked jawed from anger. Even meet with these people in person to become friends, only for them to still make fun of me in person with one single friend who introduced me, and another friend who left me being a friend as a kid because I showed them five nights at Freddy\u2019s in fucking grade 11, runs to his mom, she says I\u2019m a bad influence and we shouldn\u2019t hang anymore. Older brother also likes to beat me up or make fun of me, especially as children. Now he\u2019s just a fat dummy with a big mouth, and no future. And even though I may have one, I really, really feel like hatred goes through my body when thinking of anybody inside of that type of space all jumping together on someone who didn\u2019t do anything wrong. Nobody helps anymore, they just attack. And it\u2019s making me lethally Angered. I\u2019ve always been also that kind of extremely over nice person, always giving people my lunch good in elementary and in high school just a class clown making people laugh, but while being fat. and now, my whole life, i feel now autism, which people have said is a superpower, which I used to believe, I feel it\u2019s a curse. I lost my girlfriend after she found out my forms friends had shared photos of us online and made me so upset she stopped messaging me, I have no more friends and I just stare at my tv after slaving away at school, and end the day. Parents have been my only support my entire life along with my brother. Everyone on my life even from early age has passed and I miss them and it haunts me and I have nightmares about the earth ending, me having no future, etc. My best friend, my entire life ive ever met who even remotely was with me everywhere, spending time with me 247 everyday all day, obviously is my parents and family / friends, but my dog. These so called friends also go on to make fun of my dying grandfather in bed and insult him dying on his death bed. Then when my dog dies last may last year after I told them a few months before I never wanted to see them again, explode and cause a massive scene at my house because of my explosive episodes when I\u2019m angry. Week later, my best friends body was shutting down. In less than 48 hours after this. My best friend was now dead. And it felt as if it was partially been my own actions to cause it. Always have explosive episodes where I used to threaten myself or others who hurt me, only ever got bad to the point in class, one of these kids from this group, but years before, made me so angry with suicidal thoughts, I stood up And began to try to cute my throat with a pair of cutting scissors, I wanted to be happy, leave me alone. 10 years later these demons are still with me inside my mind, I can\u2019t stop these thoughts, and I just want to be, even though I could or should be happy, I really. I think I just want someone genuinely who hasn\u2019t met me, to just love who I am. Why is this so hard to find now today? And why do those people who look get punished often for doing so? I\u2019ve been to therapy, I\u2019ve been working out, I have been making myself better. But truthfully, I think it\u2019s felt hurt wise even more impactful now, with all this built up stress. I\u2019m almost done college, I want to pass this because I want to tell everyone who ever thought I would fail, I can do anything, and anyone can to if they put their mind to it. I don\u2019t know anymore. I just feel off, I\u2019m alone, and I wish honestly truthfully, more women out there were nicer to men especially when that person might be experiencing PTSD, MPD, Bipolarism or even extreme hormonal rampages by feeling angry. All this has built up in me since I\u2019ve been in grade 8, probably around 12 years old? 13? Also my teacher before high school was a drill Sargent jackass type teacher, who terrified me to my core. He didn\u2019t help students. He scared them. Also he was going to be a police officer but failed do to him not being able to do efficient takedowns with standard policing equipment. Building rage inside me, fires burning inside my sky\u2019s, the room stays dry. Shit never changes. When will someone please kindle my fire? I don\u2019t know anymore. Will these kids ever apologize to me? If even one childhood bully talked to me again, and apologized i would feel, somewhat, \u201chappy\u201d. I have a hard time smiling even now, i feel that miserable with my current life. And i even just got a new dog only a couple months ago. What the fuck is wrong with me? My teeth bite my nails down to the nail line. The pain never goes away, but it doesn\u2019t feel any different to the shit and pain I\u2019ve already been through. That\u2019s what sucks the most. And I know I can achieve great things. I believe I can. But it feels hard these days in my shoes. Personally. And I wish I could use honestly or see a bit more stuff in this planet that could firstly, come meet me, and not me, having to practically beg and walk over to them.

I\u2019d love to hear from people who have *lived experience* with depression because I want to make sure I\u2019m handling this the right way. I am a normally very stable person with many spoons to share with my friends. I would hate to do anything that might make this worse. Note I am NOT trying to get back with him. I might be open to that down the road but my heart can't do this again. My49 ex M53 broke up with me after Christmas. I am annoyed he let me go for Christmas and leave more of my things there and not say anything. He broke up with me end of January. Now both of us agree (and still agree) that this was the healthiest relationship we had both ever been in. No fights, only minor disagreements that were dealt with in disgustingly healthy ways., He says I was the best sex of his life (this is important, not a brag. I have only had sex when I am present so I am willing to take his word for it. We were good friends as well as great lovers. It was a long distance relationship. But that hadn't been much of a hurdle as I travelled over seas often and was supposed to be moving there soon. On my own, not through him. This was the sort of relationship where his friends pulled me aside and said things like 'he is the best version of himself when you are around' and he says things like \"I am more confident when you are around' where family embraces me as a new member because the love what they see between us. Then he hit a deep depression spiral. Not his first, but his first since we have been together. He told me we broke up because he 'isn't feeling it'. But he isn't feeling anything. This is a man who ALWAYS had a sexual partner, often more than one. Dating him was like returning to my teen days. I feel that he lost his desire and also lost his feeling of 'romance'. He isn't feeling anything in that way for anyone (He was a borderline porn addict, but we had fetishized that into our relationship and both found it hot. BTW we are both kinky AF! one of the many reasons this is on my alt account. My regular account is old like 15 years and known by many people in my life) He told me he felt numb, that his spark for everything was gone, including his desire for a relationship. He didn\u2019t leave me for someone else. He didn\u2019t say he stopped caring. He just... *shut down.* He said he wanted to stay friends, and I genuinely want that too. He is still one of my favourite humans. But since the breakup, he\u2019s been increasingly avoidant, not just with me, but with everyone. Many in our friend group haven't heard much from him at all. He has spoke to no one about our relationship. He rarely reaches out, cancels or postpones conversations, and when he does message, it\u2019s usually brief and apologetic, saying things like, \u201cBad times.\u201d I know depression lies. I know it makes things feel impossible. I don\u2019t want to push him if space is what he truly needs, but I also don\u2019t want to disappear if *connection* would actually help. I don\u2019t want him to feel like an obligation, but I also don\u2019t want him drowning alone because he *thinks* that\u2019s what he deserves. I am also honestly scared for him. He is the sole carerer for his mom who is now on palliative care in home. She is an amazing woman and the love they share is deep and wholesome. He has said many times previously that his mental health is better when he has a job. But with her health being bad this is his full time job and it is not fulfilling the same need. I worry he may try something stupid when she passes. But I am afraid to say much to not come across as the 'odd ex fianc\u00e9' I also find it odd that all these people who are our friends and saw us together not once has asked him WTF dude. You had a woman whom you loved and loved you and would have stood with you through anything what the hell happened? Any do's and don'ts? Any insight? Should I walk away from him whilst he heals?

But I think I messed up, and now my sister is distancing herself from me. I\u2019m 24M, and my sister is 21F. We used to be really close, but things changed in the past few months. She had a 3-month relationship, and after the breakup, she started having anxiety attacks. I was the one who supported her, and she told me she wouldn't date again. But now, she\u2019s secretly chatting with someone again. She hides her chats, deletes messages, and acts differently when I\u2019m around. I tried talking to her and told her that she\u2019s free to do whatever she wants, but I don\u2019t want her dating again, at least not now. I reminded her of her past experience, but she just said, \u201cIt\u2019s my life, my choice.\u201d That hit me hard. But here\u2019s the thing\u2014I\u2019m not innocent in all this. I used to be overly protective, and yeah, I even invaded her privacy. I kept an eye on her, checked who she was talking to, and I\u2019ve even tried hacking into networks to see her messages (which didn\u2019t work). I thought I was doing it to protect her, but now I see how it must have felt like I was spying on her. Now, she\u2019s avoiding me. Today, we were sitting with our relatives, and the moment they left the room, she left too\u2014on purpose. She doesn\u2019t even ask me simple things like what to bring from outside when my dad tells her to check with everyone. What hurts me even more is that whenever I ask her \"When will we talk?\", she just says \"We'll see\" and avoids answering directly. No matter what I ask, her response is always \"We'll see.\" It feels like she doesn\u2019t care anymore, or maybe she\u2019s waiting for me to stop asking. And the worst part? She\u2019s not forgiving me. I\u2019ve apologized, I\u2019ve tried to talk things out, but she straight-up told me to \"stay away\" for now. It\u2019s like she wants nothing to do with me. I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s just mad at me, or if I\u2019ve permanently damaged our bond. I know I made mistakes, but I did it out of concern. At the same time, I\u2019m dealing with my own problems\u2014career uncertainty, health issues, and depression since I was 18. Everything feels messed up. I even started smoking again from the stress. I don\u2019t know what to do. Should I distance myself? Apologize again? Or just let things be? I feel like I\u2019ve lost my sister, and I don\u2019t know how to fix it.", "eczhm3": "My friend attempted suicide a couple days ago. My family is saying I will \"ruin Christmas\" if I spend time with her in the hospital on Christmas Eve instead of visiting them. What can I do? A good friend of mine with whom I've been attending therapy for BPD overdosed a couple days ago. She survived and was transported unconscious to the hospital. She woke up but is unsurprisingly devastated. I want to be there as her support, she has a boyfriend but no family members who care about her and few friends. I had plans to see my family for Christmas but when this happened, it left me deeply depressed, particularly because another good friend of mine had committed suicide four years ago almost on the same day. To elaborate, I don't like spending Christmas with my family. I like them, but Christmas has always been more about chores and preparations than about quiet and peace. I thought I would spend Christmas by visiting my friend in the hospital. I don't want her to be alone, I know that if I were in her situation I would appreciate it if someone came to visit me. So I proposed this to my mother and brother, even the possibility that I would spend the afternoon with her and then go down to see them before dinner. However, their comments left gasping for air. They showed little empathy for my friend or me. My mother asked me if I had any \"normal\" friends. My brother told me that while it's ultimately my choice, I would be ruining Christmas by not coming down, or even by coming down just for dinner, that everyone would be disappointed in me and it would create arguments, implying I would be at fault for them. Here's the breakdown: with my family, I risk being ostracized for weeks if not months if I don't go down there. However, I've felt more and more like they were less and less my family, while I've felt like my friends have shown more compassion and empathy for my depression and BPD than my family ever has - in fact, they've dismissed it as me \"not having enough social activity\", as \"not having enough will\", and have called my therapy \"a waste of time.\" I feel like visiting my friend is the right thing to do, I know I will think of her the whole time I would be down at my family's, but I do not want to be ostrasized for months. I don't think I could handle it with my mental condition. Any and all thoughts are welcome. Thank you.", "my6sxy": "I decided to tell people \"I am not okay\" when close friends ask me \"how are you? Here is how it went... Every single one of them left me on read. I am really not doing well isolated in quarantine and I get text conversations are the lowest form of communication. but it's all we got in these times. (I am in Michigan with the highest current covid cases in the US, and seeing people isn't really an option). I even texted my friend (who I was just Bestman for in October) that I am not doing well and really need to talk to someone and he has ghosted me. Many of these friends come to me when they are alone, depressed, or need advice. (Also he is the most glued to his phone type of person I have ever met). I am in therapy, and I get like regular people aren't qualified to discuss these topics sometimes and feel uncomfortable about the topic, but I guess I had hoped one of my friends would listen. I am feeling extra bad that I have to literally pay someone to listen to me, makes me wonder if I am insufferable.", "e9uflv": "I'm tired of being everyone's therapist when no one will give me ten serious minutes of their time. I've had a bunch of stuff happen to me in the past month. I got appendicitis and surgery; still recovering. Accidentally twisted my ankle. I got a cold, which I'm still fighting. However, none of that seemed to be enough for people to give me a break from emotional labor; they demand it from me 24/7, practically. Not asking for advice, really just ranting. These are just a few examples. I had my sister calling me talking about her boyfriend who just drinks all the time and does nothing, and she was complaining about how she hates where she works. I tell her to get rid of the man and get a job somewhere else. It wasn't as short as it sounds. I listened to her and gave her serious advice, though I know she won't take it because she never does. Instead of thanking me, no one ever does, she tells me that it's easy for me to tell her to just get another job because I don't have one and can just sit around and sleep. Well, thanks, I just love sitting around and thinking about my crappy life; it is a positive joy. We hadn't spoken until her son ended up in an issue and, of course, the family therapist (me) gets a text, asking me to talk to her son and try to get him to listen to \"reason\". I agree just because I know my nephew doesn't get good support from her. Come to find out, she's mad because he's dating some girl who has a kid already. I can't say it's great at his age, but he's also an adult, so I just told him to be careful, watch out for emotional abuse, and reminded him of his last relationship, which was like a copy of his mom's relationships; she doesn't realize he gets his bad examples from her. After talking to him, his mom texts me and is like, \"I'm getting off work in a few hours, I'll call and we can do a three-way call and talk to him.\" Nowhere did she ASK me if this was okay, didn't ask if I was busy or anything, but as with most of my family, since I'm at home, I never have anything important to do, so they just tell me to do stuff instead of asking, like I'm a human being. I tell her I texted him and I was still recovering and needed to sleep. She didn't ask me what I was recovering from, if I was okay, nothing. Just said, \"Okay, night.\" My niece had trouble at school and she's a lot like my sister, unable to let go of things. She's upset because some girl at school wants to fight her because my niece took her chair. A chair this girl wasn't using, mind you, but that was just sitting next to her. My niece calls me, upset and frantic over this because the girl won't let it go and went to the office and had my niece called out of class because the girl wanted an apology. My niece refused because she said she hadn't even done anything and she went to the principal, who told her that the girl is known for \"keeping things going\", so she wouldn't be bothered again, but my niece wouldn't get off the phone until I promised to stay up until she got out of school in case they call her into the office again and she wanted me to talk to them. A huge reason I don't have kids is so I don't have to deal with the stress of dealing with teachers and other parents, yet I have to be a parent to my niece because my sister won't be. Mind you, I had just come back from the doctor, had been hopped up on pain meds and wanted to do nothing, but sleep. I forced myself to stay awake, but thankfully, no one called. Then, my sister calls me and is crying, telling me how much she wants her boyfriend to leave the house. So, I don't say anything and just let her talk. Finally, she's like, \"I just don't know what to do or how to get him out of my house.\" I told her to call the police; she doesn't want to get him in any more trouble because he has a DUI because he drinks and drives. SHE allows him to drink and drive her car, because he doesn't have one and doesn't have a license. I won't even touch how stupid that is. So, I get frustrated with her and tell her that I keep telling her how to get rid of him and she never listens, so I don't know what she wants me to do. She acts like I offended her and is like, \"I just called to vent, can't I vent, sometimes?\" I tell her that she can, but I'm tired of getting calls almost every week about this man; I'm not her therapist or life coach or anything, I'm barely hanging on by a thread a lot of days and hearing about this situation distresses me because, even if I don't like her very much, I don't want to hear about anyone dealing with this type of stuff. Not to mention, her best friend was killed just a few months ago by her boyfriend who was abusive and drunk a lot... make him leave before he gets to that point. Anyway, she accuses me of making it about me and hangs up. Maybe I did make it about me, but I want people to understand that I am not a therapist and I cannot fix their issues and I'm not emotionally well enough to take on all this stuff. I'm not sure anyone is, tbh. Finally, we come to today. My mother had to take me to the doctor because I couldn't get there on my own and need support to get there. We're talking about normal stuff, then she's like, \"Aren't you tired of just sitting at home and doing nothing? You really need to get out and get a life.\" I don't ever like talking to my mom about my mental health because she acts like it's a phase that should have been over in my teens and she doesn't understand why I'm \"letting it bother me\" as an adult. I'd like to mention, she has horrible anxiety, as well, but she powers through it to work, at least, it still takes over her life. She also doesn't do much outside of the house and has no life, but when I point that out, she brings it back to me. Anyway, I tell her I just paid all the bills and since the bills got higher, I don't have money to have a life, even if I wanted to. So, then, she's like, \"If you get a job, you'd have more money.\" I know this, but I have tried many times to hold a job; I cannot do it for more than a few days without having panic attacks and breakdowns, which either end up with me leaving or getting let go, which then leads me into a deep depression. She acts like I don't try and this is even with medicine and therapy. Sometimes, I'm sure the main reason none of this works is because I'm around my family, but I never tell them that because I don't want to deal with that fallout. At this point, I'm just tired of the conversation, so I don't respond. Then, she brings up how I need to get some friends, at least... says the woman who literally has one friend and who got upset at my aunt for going out without her, even though she never goes anywhere when she invites her. Heavy eyeroll. Anyway, I tell her that I've tried to have friends; it's not my fault they don't put effort in and either they end up not talking or I fade out because nothing is happening. She asks me why I don't hang out with the people I met last summer. The two girls I met last summer were nice, but one would rarely go out with us because she would rather stay in with her boyfriend, which left me and the other girl. We hung out a few times, but then she got a new trivia group and stopped texting me back, so I stopped texting her and let that fade out. This happens too often, so I stopped trying to make friends. I tell my mom that I don't talk to them anymore, and she's like, \"That's your problem, you don't try and cut people off so quickly.\" I texted the second girl every day for a week; she wasn't working at the time and she was always posting snaps, so I knew she was available, I wasn't going to keep texting for no reason. I try to have boundaries and get crapped on for them. Unfortunately, I am not one of those people who will keep trying and trying and trying when I see things obviously aren't going along, anymore. She then goes into this long story about how she met her only friend and how they only talk like once a month, but they are still good friends and I need to be more \"realistic\" with friends. What good is a friend whom I only talk to for 10 minutes once a month and hang out with, maybe once every three months? If that works for her, great, but that's not \"getting a life\" or anything else. Plus, I have a history of getting friends and then I become the \"therapy friend\" and I fade away because all they ever do is come around to dump their problems on me and get advice, then I don't hear from them for months, when something else is going wrong. That's not friendship, to me. And go back to my mom and my aunt. My aunt is mad at my mom for \"checking up on her\" at her age and, of course, I get pulled into it because my mom is being childish and won't talk to my aunt, so I've been designated the go-between, but I never said I would be. They are 20+ years older than me, why am I even in this? I don't know. I'm just tired of being everyone's therapist and mediator. I keep trying to explain how draining it is. They obviously see I have my own issues, but they continually pour their issues onto me, expect sincere, helpful, empathetic responses, but let me feel bad or need something and everyone is busy or doesn't answer their phones or I get \"advice\" that isn't helpful. My niece and nephew would probably talk, but I don't want to burden them with my issues; their mother does that to them enough, and they complain about it, to me, of course. What is it about me that makes everyone think I'm a therapist? Plus, none of them pay me for my services. That probably makes me more upset than anything; if I was a real therapist, I'd probably be rich off all these \"sessions\", lol.", "1jgtoji": "My Own Worst Enemy Well. I suppose a lot of people new to this sub have a longer backstory than can be put into one post. But here goes mine in short form. I (M28) have been dealing with terrible anxiety, centric around romantic relationships, since my very first one, as a highschool sophomore. Undoubtedly, it stems from huge fears of rejection, and my mother not being in my life from 6th grade, until I became a 22 year old homeowner. As well as a divorce with the mother of my one son. I'm a people pleaser with mommy issues and a bad image of how marriage ends. Fast foreward to last year, my current relationship (F27) was going down the tubes, and we suffered from a dead bedroom. A failed attempt at opening the relationship, residual feelings and hidden text messages from the people we tried to connect with, and a near breakup, left my trust broken a bit and left me with panic attacks about being left or cheated on. But she met with an online therapist often enough, and is on medication for anxiety/trauma. I started therapy in the summer time and from there, we grabbed the shock paddles, jumpstarted the heart, and learned what it would take to keep this relationship alive. Lately, things have been looking up, panic attacks are infrequent/non-existent and we're reclaiming our bedroom, reclaiming our own free time, and our wonderful relationship, step by step, slowly but surely. At the begining of this week, we found ourselves in the mood to send each other nude and nude adjacent pictures. Couldn't have been more excited. And then she sent a picture, that was taken a while back, when she was just feelin herself and wanted to take a hot picture, but it was definitely taken from our bed, at night time, and she sent it to me during the daytime, while she was out on the road. And BOOM. A terrible anxious spiral overcame me and I was thrown back into last summer where every move, every text, every thing that she did, and didn't tell me about or explain was a personal attack. I was SURE that she took it a calendar year ago and recycled it to me to humor the situation. I waited a good 3 days to gain some mental clarity and have a session with my therapist. And last night I thought I found the best way to ask her, (not accuse her) of when the picture might have been taken and if I was the only one who saw it. And she still got very hurt and insulted that I would ever assume she would do that to me. Reasonable. But. I also felt like I could never bring my problems to her, without her becoming the victim and assuming I see her as pure evil. Now I'm just mad that I was gaslighting myself and may have ruined or perhaps, reset my chances of sending racy pictures, and I don't know how to make her feel like A: I still love the idea of nudes, B: I definitely didn't feel that way, from a place of malice, but more out of fear. But also C: I still feel heard and respected when I bring her an \"I feel\" statement about a certain event. TL;DR long history of relationship centered anxiety. Received a nude-ish picture that didn't sit right with me, due to said anxiety, and tried to respectfully explain why I came home from work in a panicked state. It turns out I gaslit myself into thinking she was cheating and now I feel dumb and she feels insulted. I hope I didn't ruin my chances of getting more pics.", "kk6u2r": "The best gift I could have gotten on Christmas My teenage son has OCD and for the last year+ his brain has been telling him that I am \u201cinfected\u201d so he often won\u2019t stay in the same room as me, sometimes won\u2019t talk to me, races away from me and won\u2019t touch things that I\u2019ve touched. It\u2019s incredibly challenging and hurts my heart. For Christmas, he said I get a hug. I could see him taking deep breaths (subtly) and preparing himself. I asked how long I could hug him and he said as long as I wanted. When I hugged him, I asked him if I could give him a kiss, too, and he said yes, so I kissed his head. It filled my heart with so much warmth and peace and happiness and I can still feel it a couple hours later. I truly understand anxiety and I know just how difficult this was for him. It was the most selfless and loving and special gift I could have gotten. Also, as a side note, my older son got me an extra gift for my stocking because I\u2019m divorced and this is my first Christmas as a single woman.

Also this guy I like a lot rn had to go to to his car to get something and I literally panicked the whole time he left, even tho he literally left all his belongings inside.

Yet nothing was taken care of bc my mom was the one in control of the narrative. What does it matter if life goes on while death happens every second of every hour? Why does it matter to the people I love and who love me back if leave this world? Bc they will be sad for a couple days and life will continue? So what I take an early leave?

My bf is loyal, confident, affectionate, fun person. He would never do anything to harm me, respects me, wouldn't push for anything physical which I'm not comfortable with and he also wants to be in a committed relationship. The problem is I have gone through some issues in my life and some ongoing, I have OCD, PMDD gone through some surgeries for my uterus and have painful periods cramps. My bf on the other hand has had a easier life and he doesn't really do well in stressful situations, a small thing like minor fight with a random person in street would make his mood godown and small physical injuries also would hurt him a lot. Even in our relationship, if we fight or have an argument he can't really handle it and he says it's fucks his mood up and he's sensitive like that. He wants to have a lots of fun and would avoid anything that's uncomfortable or stressful even at the slightest. He has himself said he is not emotionally mature. He also has listening problems like he won't listen fully to you and would often cut you off even though he has worked on that problem and has come so far for me. I mask my mental health struggle so well and I often felt alone and unheard in this relationship and I asked him to check up on me now and then and he does that and he tells me I can talk to him and open up but the times I did I never felt understood and I feel like he's doing it just bc I have asked him to. The main problem here for me is, if he has not faced any life challenge and trust me I come with challenges like mental ups and downs and physical struggles I need some support, how will he be there for me when I need him? I need an emotionally mature, understanding and listening man to be with so he can see that I'm struggling and is there for me. I don't know how long I can mask and look like that fun happy person which I'm not that often", "1j6qtmw": "She told me I was everything to her a day before, now I don't exist. What happened? Text: I (23M) was in a relationship with my ex (22F) for a year. We loved each other intensely, almost foolishly. She was a genuinely amazing person\u2014supportive, kind, and loving. She stood by me even when I had doubts, and I struggled because she had so many great qualities. But suddenly, everything changed, and now it feels like I never existed to her. The Biggest Issue in Our Relationship: From the start, my struggle was acceptance\u2014I didn\u2019t feel 100% sure about her. I liked her, but I kept questioning whether she was \"the one.\" She knew about my hesitation and was patient, believing we could work through it. Despite my doubts, we were deeply connected. I was incredibly supportive of her, especially during her mental health struggles. I went to therapy, both for myself and to understand her condition. I tried everything to make this relationship work, and she did the same for me. What Happened to Her? (A Breakdown in Steps) 1. She stopped taking her medication (Carbalt) in late January 2025. 2. She entered a phase of unusual energy, confidence, and hyperactivity\u2014a stark contrast to her usual withdrawn self. 3. Then, she faced multiple personal crises: Fights with her family. Conflict with an old friend (who was also the sister of her ex). 4. She started showing drastic personality changes: Became aggressive, impulsive, and confrontational. Started swearing more and posting bizarre videos with confusing statements. Changed her online identity and dressed differently. 5. A few days later, she broke up with me, saying: \"We were lying to ourselves. Your eyes were never fully on me.\" \"This relationship wasn\u2019t right for us.\" 6. I simply asked her not to talk about me on TikTok. She reacted by: Sending me a 5-minute voice note full of insults. Blocking me everywhere. How I Tried to Help Even after she blocked me, I knew something was wrong. I contacted her therapist, who then reached out to her family. They couldn\u2019t find her for hours. I went to another doctor near her home for advice. I helped track her phone location to get her safely to the hospital. She was hospitalized for weeks. Meanwhile, she started messaging one of my old friends, someone I had past conflicts with because she used to be overly friendly with him. She told him everything about our relationship, even though she once said: \"If I ever leave you, I\u2019ll disappear from your life completely, including your friends.\" Now, they still talk to this day. After She Got Out of the Hospital She reopened social media but removed me instead of blocking me this time. When I saw her stories, she removed me completely. She acts as if I never existed. What Her Cousin Told Me (Who Still Talks to Her) I reached out to her cousin, Randa, who told me: She still holds resentment toward anyone who was around her during her crisis. She believes everyone who tried to help actually hurt her. She isn\u2019t ready to face people who remind her of that period. Edit : I didn't ask for the diagnosis as the therapist told me that his ethics can't allow him doing that, I didn't ask her cousin and i really need to know what happened but it seems in our culture that may be i will be an Intruder as We didn't get married or even plan seriously to do so we were just in a romantic relationship and literally fixing my sight and acceptance for here at therapy sessions cause we both wanted to continue but I didn't dully accept her, she knew all of that ,even though she loved and accepted the state as it was till we figure it out. \ud83c\udf00For what really happened after all of that month at the hospital, I couldn't ask her family about her due to our society restrictions , I was praying for ger for a month and giving her such excuses as she wasn't normal at doing these actions , then I was surprised after a month that she was talking to that friend that we struggled due to him , then appearing on social media and removing me from Instagram and Facebook and interacting with these friend and here other friends like Don't care about my reaction... Even though that friend came and told me everything and said to me that he respected my My existence back in her life so not treating her like she will not be his gf But she is acting like she didn't know me before and I am afraid to talk to her or even seeing her in the university as the therapist said she might take a bad action against you or I might even see her with another one or in a bad state that hurts me I EVEN DIDN'T MOVE ON TILL A MONTH LATER without knowing anything about here and just waiting her to heal (which still in progress) and just GIVING HER AN EXCUSE THAT SHE IS ILL , now SHE IS LIVING HER LIFE LOOKING GOOD AND TALKING TO THAT FRIEND AND I'M STUCK HERE DIDN'T EVEN TAKE THE ACTION OF MOVING ON ! I really so loyal to her but her actions rn are so painful to me despite their reason wether they're due to mental illness or Personal will& personal decision The therapist told me that she blocked me when that happened earlier and when she left the hospital she removed me again \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb I think removing is different than blocking for her as she was believing that doors might be opened in the future again and she actually told me that when she blocked me but I'm afraid that these doors might not open again anymore \ud83d\ude2d as chatgpt said that these traumatic people might change with No way back --- Now, I\u2019m here, wondering what actually happened. Did her mental health shift make her genuinely stop loving me? Was this truly a breakup she wanted, or was it influenced by her condition? Has anyone else experienced something like this? Can someone just delete you from their life so easily after everything?", "14nj2oy": "I was going to kill myself today When I was 8, I was raped by 2 teenagers. Multiple times. They told me they were going to kill my family. I was terrified. So I didn't fight them the time after that, or the many other times that followed. The rapes only stopped because my mom couldn't pay the rent and we had to move. When I was in middle school, my mother had taken too many prescription pills and totaled our only car with my brother in it. My mother was arrested and my brother was fine. I missed my mom when she was in jail. She got released a week later. She got back on schedule with her medications. And then I remember begging her to be part of this family, because she had been abusing her meds again. I started drinking in middle school. I didn't stop. We had many pets, and in that sense I watched many of my pets due to not being able to afford vet care. I remember when we lost power on Christmas week and we froze all week. I remember boiling water to bathe and dumping water outside of my bathroom window because the tub wouldn't drain. I started cutting myself in middle school. Everyone thought it was because me and my friend had a falling out because my mother attacked her father. We became friends again and I did stop cutting myself. I hated the attention it had brought me. I felt so empty. I started smoking weed and experienced my first panick attack. I kept smoking weed, I kept drinking. I was in high school when I met her. Her mom did cocaine, we did Cocaine. I missed a lot of school. I was quite drunk or high for most of my developing years. I got my first legal job at 17. I worked as much as I could. I started paying bills around the house. I felt helpful. I drank every night. I met him during high school. It started as a one night stand, but he had a car and knew how to get me off. I remember him calling me in the middle of the night for me to go meet him in his car and we'd go smoke weed and fuck until I had to be to school the next day. I started college a year after high school. I got worse then, but made good and bad friends. I fell in love, again. My love got arrested. I was 20 then. I moved back home and he moved in. We had been together the whole time. He became angrier. He would yell, he would scream at me day after day. Then he would hit me. I used to tell him no, but he would pin me. I stopped crying so long ago. I knew I didn't deserve anything else, not even death. I found out I was pregnant at 21. I hadn't gotten my period for 3 months. I still drank heavily. I even convinced my friend to cauterize a cut on his finger. I was 9 weeks when I was able to get my abortion. I had to go in for the vaginal ultrasound, there wasn't a heart beat. That broke me. I always wanted kids, but I couldn't have a child with this man, especially a dead one. I suffered alone with that. I bled and cried and drank and smoked. My mom left me. I was in and out of therapy. He hated when I went to therapy. I had a good counselor, but I fucked that up too when I tried to sleep with him. Part of me thinks I still would. I had always planned on killing myself. It never got better for so long. And then I met my lover. He showed me kindness my own mother couldn't. He gave me refuge and love. We fucked too, of course. I left my ex. I tried to. I packed my stuff and left to go be with my lover and his kids. And that's where I'm at today. Nearly 4-5 years later. Still in and out of therapy. Now on medications and now clean. Diagnosed with Barrets esophagus, non dysplasia, and PTSD, Depression, GAD and probably more. But the last few months I started using body soap and a loofah, in addition to my very few self care routines and now I use lotion on my bumpy arms. I go to the gym. I just graduated with my RN degree and have a high chance of passing my boards. I fell in love with caring for people when I became a CNA. I am surrounded by healthy animals who's bills I can afford. I have such a patient and loving man helping me navigate my crazyund and crazy past. I get frustrated with myself easily, and he reassures me constantly. It's not a perfect road for either of us. Lots of trial and error, especially getting me sober or navigating my moods. I talk to my family again and I miss them now. I see them more. I have good relationships with people. I did lose a lot of my old friends, but I had to. I am doing so much better, and of course I still fuck up and of course I still cry all the time, but I'm healing. I'm 28 and I should of been dead at 25. I do not want to kill myself. I just want to be a little better every year. Don't give in, never give up. It's tough. And I'm still fighting my head every day, nearly every second. But it does go silent at work. Or when I see the kids having a moment or when we go to fairs.

A couple of years ago, I became curious about losing my virginity through penetration with a man, and I decided to do it with an older man, around 50 years old. For some reason, I felt it would be easier with someone older than someone my age, and less weird. I wanted someone to use me, I suppose. I did it, and at first, I felt disgust, and afterwards, it was awful. I felt so dirty. By the way, it was only penetration, nothing else, no kissing, nothing, i was very specific to not do it. About a year later, my mind pushed me to do it again. I went on a casual sex website, talked to someone, no photos, and they came in the early morning, penetrated me, and left. The same thing happened 2-3 more times. I didn\u2019t enjoy any of these encounters at all. I dissociate, and at the end, when they leave, I feel nauseous and disgusted. Through all of this, I always consented, no one took advantage of me, but it was like I was on autopilot, not caring that I was hating it.

I just lay in bed all day watching TV and the only thing that gives me hope is that someday I won't exist anymore. There is less and less of me everyday. I have no personality anymore.

She once got aggressive towards me when I was taking my laundry up because last time I forgot to take the hamper down. She doesn\u2019t allow me to have any sense of individuality. She will get annoyed at me because I\u2019m not wearing the right underwear or socks. She is also very overprotective, To the point where I am not allowed to go into our backyard when she is not her, I am not allowed to be out of sight when we\u2019re outside, and I\u2019m not allowed to leave the street without her watching. I rarely went outside for the first 12 yesrs of my life because she made it such a hassle. She also talks about how good of a parent she is extremely often. Once, I jokingly rooted against her football team and she made a comment about how she feeds me.

They were fighting on the front porch while I was in the kitchen making a bottle for my 8 mo son who was sleeping in his crib on the other side of the house. After they were arguing, my dad walked in to the house, shut his bedroom door and shot himself in the head.

As I was walking out of her office I said \"I swear to God I'm gonna kill myself\" & she said \"Okay, kill yourself\". I turned around & said \"what?\" & she said \"Go ahead, kill yourself, go on\" & I stormed out, had a panic attack & called my sister. We went back to her office & she didn't want to speak to us & instead sent her secretary to talk to us. He told us to follow him outside, took us to the parking lot, yelled at us, squared up & called us sick. He said that since we are \"sick\" we should be careful. I told him that the doctor couldn't say those things to me & he said \"Who's the doctor? She is, so she can say it & you said it first.\" Then he cussed at us & told us to leave. I have the audio recording of the secretary yelling at us & stuff. My parents are really mad & wanna report her.

I'm currently 17 and the first time I recall hearing her doing this was when we lived with my aunt shortly after my parents broke up and I shared a room with my mom. She would almost every night have sex and I would have to sit there for what felt like hours covering my ears. Then we eventually started living in a camper and it would happen so much the whole camper would shake and all I would hear was the noises. Now we live in a house, and at least we have our own rooms but I still hear them because the walls are so thin and they leave the door open. I bring this up because I cannot and never have been able to have a healthy sexual relationship with myself without thinking of them having sex. The noises and the shaking. I just wanted to tell this on here because this is the only way I feel like I can anonymously say it and I just want some help because it still happens to this day and I just wonder if it's trauma or if I'm just being overly dramatic.

I\u2019ve always been attracted to women, I\u2019ve never felt attraction to men. I\u2019m in a relationship, which for now is long-distance, but my girlfriend visits me, she recently came. A couple of years ago, I became curious about losing my virginity through penetration with a man, and I decided to do it with an older man, around 50 years old. For some reason, I felt it would be easier with someone older than someone my age, and less weird. I wanted someone to use me, I suppose. I did it, and at first, I felt disgust, and afterwards, it was awful. I felt so dirty. By the way, it was only penetration, nothing else, no kissing, nothing, i was very specific to not do it. About a year later, my mind pushed me to do it again. I went on a casual sex website, talked to someone, no photos, and they came in the early morning, penetrated me, and left. The same thing happened 2-3 more times. I didn\u2019t enjoy any of these encounters at all. I dissociate, and at the end, when they leave, I feel nauseous and disgusted. Through all of this, I always consented, no one took advantage of me, but it was like I was on autopilot, not caring that I was hating it. I want to stop doing it, I feel terrible, I have no libido with my girlfriend, even though I love her and want to be with her.

Very disorganized rant, sorry... So, ever since a couple of months ago, my sister has been experiencing paranoid delusions and auditory hallucinations probably due to her MS diagnosis. She claims to hear voices in the walls of her bedroom and accuses my parents of installing a speaker in the wall so her abusive on-and-off again boyfriend can mess with her. She doesn't believe us when we say that's not true and that we don't hear what she's hearing. She also says that there's something about the room that doesn't want her in it? I think that's just because she knows that the room used to be my grandpa's and he died in there but it's just a room at the end of that day... Tonight she kept ringing the doorbell (she's not allowed house keys since her bf took hers before and we had to change the locks) at 10pm but refused to come inside because she was afraid of the house. I guess her boyfriend dumped her. She also was paranoid about him breaking into the house and on one occasion she called the police because she thought she was hearing me being assaulted by him/whoever. This delusion kind of morphed into her thinking I was secretly involved with her boyfriend and started coming into my room at night to search it. It ended up getting a bit aggressive when one night while I was undressed (I told her this) and holding the door closed, she like battering rammed herself in while I was fucking naked! After that, I became pretty cautious and rightfully afraid of her so I got a lock put on my door. But this didn't stop her from pounding on my door some nights, insisting that she heard someone in my room with me. She refuses to believe anything I say and sees everything I do as suspicious. She says that she's been seeing a therapist but only once a month so I'm not really inclined to believe her either. She refuses to voluntarily go to a mental hospital, so am I really just going to have to wait until she hurts herself or me and my parents for something to be done about this situation?

My parents have finally taken steps to get him assessed, which I\u2019m grateful for, but it\u2019s been extremely hard on me. I\u2019m doing my best to be patient and supportive, but it often feels like he\u2019s doing it on purpose\u2014even though I know he probably isn\u2019t and is probably stimming. The only peace I get is the couple of hours I spend at the gym or the occasional hangout with a friend. But the moment I return home, I\u2019m on edge again\u2014never fully relaxed, always bracing for the next outburst. I don\u2019t want to spend the next several months\u2014or even a year\u2014living with a constant white noise machine making background noise or needing to wear headphones just to function. Home is supposed to be a place of rest and peace, but instead it\u2019s a source of anxiety. I\u2019ve been considering working from a co-working space just to escape the chaos, or even commuting to the office (which is a 2-hour round trip), but I know I won\u2019t be as productive. Feel like I'm always 'on' and can't rest. Still, it\u2019s becoming harder and harder to stay home. And that\u2019s what really breaks me\u2014if I can\u2019t find peace at work or at home, then where do I go?", "1jhubkz": "How can I cope with being lonely? A lot of the time I find myself feeling completely alone, and i'm really struggling dealing with that. Im wondering if anyone else has found any solutions or at least methods of coping with being alone? My first solution was to socialize, since i don't really go to school, but people can really overstimulate me; even just a casual hangout with my closest friend pretty much exhaustes me for the WEEK. Next, I figured being social online would be enough. Talking to strangers through a phone is a lot less stressful to me, for example on discord! Now my problem is that I'm completely attatched to one of my friends on there, I got impulsive and now he's seen things he shouldn't have, and I'm letting his attitude effect my choices, my mood, my feelings about myself... This always happens. I'm neurodivergent, I think that explains my weird relationship with people. I'm not sure what to do anymore, since no matter how I try to socialize, I end up burnt out and overwhelmed; if I don't socialize, I feel really lonely. Does anyone have any advice?", "1jhwwu0": "I need someone to tell me what this is (23 F) My mother told me she was sick last night because of my negative energy toward her (because I had angry thoughts toward her). This is not the first time this happend. We just fought again and she started crying to guilt trip me. I don't know what this type of behavior is called. She never let's me express how I feel, especially if it's negative. She wants me to be grateful just because she feeds me. I've been at home for the past four years after finishing high-school. I am unemployed and I'm sure I suffer from depression and anxiety. I'm already so lost (I barely leave the house). And she just makes me feel like crap all the time. This is just the tip of the iceberg.", "1jhv1kp": "Need Support/Help I am a 43/m that suffers from PTSD & OCD. I currently live with my elderly parents.

I have a job that somehow I\u2019ve survived two rounds of layoffs from, but we are extremely short staffed. On days that I work, I work from 3 am to 3 pm. After engagement, I\u2019m going to be moving in with my girlfriend. I feel as though I\u2019m under a tremendous amount of stress and feel like I\u2019m in the middle of a huge \u201cstorm\u201d. I don\u2019t sleep well at all. Maybe 4-5 hours tops. Has anyone been in a somewhat similar position? How was the situation handled? Any support would be greatly appreciated as I feel very stressed about these life changes.", "1jhueq8": "I don\u2019t know anything anymore I\u2019ve never posted or spoken about anything like this before so forgive me if anything doesn\u2019t make sense, I just want to get my thoughts out. I\u2019m 21 years old and I\u2019ve never felt more lost in my life, I hate my job, I have 1 friend and I\u2019ve never felt more distant. I feel alone all the time regardless of where I am or who I\u2019m with I just feel so different. Ive literally always felt different from people my own age and it doesn\u2019t matter how old I am. When I was 10 I felt much older, when I was 15 someone told me I\u2019m like a 40 yr old in a 15 year old, now I\u2019m 21 and I still feel the same way. I think I potentially have undiagnosed ADHD or some level of autism but I feel embarrassed to get a test done due to stigma in my family. Also it probably sounds like I\u2019m introverted or not very socially capable but I had a relationship for 2 years and there\u2019s been periods of time that I have had lots of friends. But in the last year I just find it hard to connect/want to connect with people and I don\u2019t know if the lack of desire comes from my previous relationship and a fear to lose someone so close again. I was so close with my ex girlfriend but we had such a difficult relationship, we argued quite a lot and arguments would become extremely emotional and almost hard on each of our mental healths, but in the same sentence, the times of love were incomparable to anything else I\u2019ve ever felt. Everyone around me thought that it was for the best that we broke up but I am so done with taking peoples opinions I need to trust my own decisions. As I said I feel so lost and when people give opinions on things it makes me feel so swayed because I clearly do not trust my own judgement. This becomes an issue because I then walk around with 1000 voices in my head saying different things and I can\u2019t have clear thoughts which makes me so agitated and upset. Also to the point of having few friends, when I was around 14/15 I had a friend group with like 20 people which slowly split up, I was then in a group with around 8 people and essentially I think because I was the quietest I got excluded from group activities and found out they were all talking about me very badly (I didn\u2019t do anything it was just about my appearance really) following this I had basically 0 friends for a while which as a 16/17 year old is incredibly hard (I used to cry everyday before and after school) I ended up getting a few friends in college which was good but I still held an anxiety so close to me. After college I went to work and everyone left my home town so I was alone again, I met my ex girlfriend a few months later and she was relatively alone too so I think we used eachother as a crutch so when we did things with other people I think we both were a bit jealous which causes issues. We have been broken up for 6 months now and although I wasn\u2019t too upset at the time it feels worse for me now (i don\u2019t know if this is normal). Anyway, in the past year/1.5 years I\u2019ve also had infections and things physically wrong with me basically the entire time which was so damaging for me. One of the infections had me hating literally everything and it was torturous for months (I hated life so much) as soon as that infection was over I got another. But yeah I\u2019ve reached the text limit so I\u2019ll summarise, I don\u2019t know what I want, I don\u2019t know how I feel, I don\u2019t understand anything and I feel so numb to everything but I just pretend it\u2019s not bad", "1jhu4iu": "I feel completely stuck and I don\u2019t know how to get out of it. This is more venting than anything. I don\u2019t know if this is the right one I\u2019m pretty new to Reddit. My life pretty much fell apart after I broke up with my ex last year. Even though I thought I was ready\u2014I wasn\u2019t. I spiraled and shut everyone out completely, acting irrationally. I had depression before, but it went off the edge after that. I\u2019ve been hospitalized for suicidal ideation four times and attempted twice since then. I blocked her because I was afraid of what I might say or do, that I would screw if up. it up.and I was starting to become obsessive. We talked a few times since then, and I keep thinking\u2014maybe if I had picked myself up a bit more, I wouldn\u2019t be in this situation. I know the life I want to lead\u2014actually spending time with people, going on trips\u2014but if I think about it\u2026 I\u2019m not doing anything in my life right now.

It\u2019s currently spring break, and I\u2019m completely alone. As I look down the road toward college, I realize that no matter where I am, I\u2019ll likely be alone in that too. I\u2019m used to it by now, but at the same time, it\u2019s getting harder again. With some new types of therapy and meds, I\u2019m at least a little better now. But now that I\u2019m doing better, I\u2019m not acting better\u2014because I don\u2019t know what to do. I spend my weekends isolated and unmoving. It\u2019s been like that for the past month, and I don\u2019t know how to make it better. I hate how I\u2019ve become. I know I\u2019m not living up to what I could be. I like to think it\u2019s just that I don\u2019t know what to do. Not that I\u2019m incapable of doing it. Im starting to lessen the amount of obsessiveness I have as I\u2019m getting better. At least starting to feel a little more of myself. Less disassociated. But I have been out of it for so long I don\u2019t know how to get into it. I have been trying to rationalize following her again since she followed me. But I\u2019m afraid that I can\u2019t handle what I might find there. It became obsessive after everything happened.more than who she is. I thought about her constantly when we were together that never went away. I think back to how I felt then. But I would give anything to go back. But it doesn\u2019t work like that. Even if I haven\u2019t had any feelings for anyone since her. To be fair. Since her I haven\u2019t really gotten to know anyone. I feel like I\u2019m hoping for a lost cause when I\u2019m thinking of getting better.

I\u2019ve never been good with my emotions, so that umpire heard about every swear word I knew as I walked back to the dugout fuming. I made my way down the steps to our locker room after slamming my helmet against my leg and throwing my bat (made sure no one got hit because I didn\u2019t want to hurt someone else mid crash out) and I was so angry at myself for letting the team down, angry because my dad would be upset at me for failing in a crucial situation, and angry because it was my 3rd strikeout on the day. Long story short I ended up punching a wall as hard as i possibly could and ended up with a bad boxers fracture (yes I know fucking stupid decision. I have mental problems and I can\u2019t control my anger sometimes.) I played the rest of the game but it was bruised and hurt like hell. So now, I\u2019m out for at least 6 weeks if not worse depending what the ortho specialist tells me (I can\u2019t get in until this next Monday).

Hey everyone, I hope this is the right subreddit. I haven\u2019t noticed this problem until later in my high school years but it has been affecting my life a lot now that I\u2019m a young adult. I have the tendency to start crying over really small things. By small, I mean explaining something serious to my mom, venting at any capacity, being asked about jobs or other semi-serious events in my life (good or bad), or having to tell somebody about a disappointing venture in my life. I\u2019ve always been known to start crying when I\u2019m really stressed out over something or overwhelmed, but now it\u2019s started to bleed into less-stressful and pretty mundane parts of my life and it\u2019s really irritating. I shouldn\u2019t be crying, I\u2019m not sad, angry, upset, or even stressed, but it just starts flowing. Does anyone know why? I never used to cry and was severely depressed in my childhood, so I\u2019m not sure if that has anything to do with it? Other subreddits I\u2019ve looked at have also talked about it being related to ADHD, which I suspect I have, but am just undiagnosed. Could that be it?

I've been feeling bad in my head, in my body and in my life for 6 years. I'm desperately looking for a way out, life in my establishment is an ordeal without names. I've developed voices in my head that torture me all day and evening. I was recently diagnosed with hypersensitivity, anxiety, school phobia and depression. I'm seeing a shrink and I've already seen a psychiatrist. Despite everything, my suicidal thoughts are becoming more and more frequent. I'm starting to hear voices, whispers and fear of being alone with them (voices + whispers). I suspect more than what I've been diagnosed with but I'm not qualified on the subject. I cut myself regularly, the last time was hundreds of cuts on my thighs, I also cut myself inside my mouth, split my lips, overdosed on medication, slapped, hit on the face, stomach, chest or even legs. I'm looking for an escape from all this but the only way out would be death. I've also already drawn disturbing things, seen things like autopsies, cut bodies and all that category. These images are engraved in my memory and give me behaviors of post-traumatic stress that are always present. I have the impression of being constantly observed, followed, and judged constantly. I no longer go to school, on the verge of dropping out. Also, I have already tried to kill myself by overdosing too much, by crashing, by being run over, or by drowning in my bathtub. The shrink, for her part, often emphasizes the fact that I am obsessed with the things that happen in my head, and that I have many depressive tendencies underlining my diagnosis.

I want to start by giving some background on my mom (72) and her relationships. My mom has always had a strong personality\u2014loving, generous, and always putting others before herself. But she is also extremely authoritative, likes to control every situation, and is highly sensitive. If something upsets her, no matter how small, she will cut you off for weeks or even months. Apologizing is not in her vocabulary. My dad (80) has been the biggest victim of this dynamic. He is extremely servile, has a hearing problem, and sometimes just zones out\u2014probably to avoid unnecessary arguments. But even in the smallest things, she asserts control. The television remote, for example, belongs solely to her. If my dad tries to raise the volume so he can hear, her mood will turn sour instantly. She has always been strict and believes in correcting \u201cothers,\u201d regardless of their age. She started her career as a disciplinarian at just 16 and was running a school at a very young age. People respected her\u2014not just out of obligation, but because they truly admired her. Lately, her ability to handle disagreements has become unbearable. You cannot win an argument with her. She lacks the ability to resolve conflicts through communication, and it\u2019s exhausting. I noticed a real shift in her personality after my grandmother passed away 12 years ago. My mom stayed by her side in the hospital for four straight years. Then, seven years ago, she lost her younger sister to lung cancer\u2014a sudden battle that lasted only two months. That loss broke her. Since then, she has never been the same. She doesn\u2019t enjoy anything anymore. She eats just to stay alive. Two months ago, she suffered a bad fall and bruised her face badly. Since then, her mood has been extremely low. She refuses to get a head scan because she no longer trusts doctors after everything she saw while caring for her mother. The past two months have made me see her differently. For most of my life, I\u2019ve seen her as this tough, unshakable force. But now, I can\u2019t help but feel that her rigid personality is a shield\u2014a defense mechanism to cope with deep trauma. And now, that shield is cracking.

She was a Friend of mine, \"we\" used to talk a lot at school, but it seem like she didn't wanna talk to me that much after i confessed. She was always so happy around my friends, not even bothering to talk to me, apart for important things. I always took care of her, she was always sick, so i gived her food when i had it, when she sat alone, because she didn't pay for the cafetaria and all her friends where there, i always asked my friends if i could go join her not to let her alone. I always did my best, texting her everyday, if i did not she wouldn't even text back. At one point, i understood, that i was only clowning myself, so, i just abandonned, and she didn't even care, maybe i'm not such a great person, was i too selfish? Was not enough? Even though she knew. She seemed more interested by my friend, and he didn't even like her. But i did, and i always do.

I truly hate myself, i always had this thought that maybe am not cut for this, i would have abandonned sooner, but this damn habit of mine, wanting to not abandon, i probably should not have risen up back when i was kid, i should have learned to abandon. When i texted her, today, saying that, she really didn't seem to care about our conversation online, she was dry, and didn't even seem to want to respond, i just sayed that it's okay, i don't hate her, i hate myself, because i know im probably not interesting, boring, ugly, i can't even define myself. I probably just want to die, listen to this voice in the back of my head. But what will it change, dead or alive, i'm still a clown. I had everything, a good life, parents, friends, family, i'm sprotif (volleyball), i learn piano, i write novels, i read.

Just continue hating myself for bot being enough for someone? I wish i wasn't born, if it was to never be loved, and only the person to love, what was my purpose? That's one of my stupid questions.

Yet, yes, yet, i always wonder if i should be around, i always wonder if im loved, if my presence brighten someone day. I always wonder if i matter.

I\u2019m stuck working the same job I have been for years. I feel worthless, I live at home (my country has a very severe housing crisis) and I just feel so hopeless. I wake up every morning apply for random jobs look at rejection emails and just live in a pure state of panic. All of my friends are in relationships and/or leaving the country.

At the end of the day i don\u2019t know how to help myself. I tell so many people i\u2019m finally getting sober, and somehow end up relapsing and it all goes down hill.

She is everything i could ever ask for, and i don\u2019t want to better myself just for her, i want it for the both of us. I have been sober lately, but i\u2019m terrified of another relapse. I think about it like, i would want a healthy and happy partner, who isn\u2019t consumed by drugs, and i know she would expect the same. I know nobody can help me but myself, and nobody is watching my every moment to force me to do better, but i would like some coping skills i can really stick to.

And yes, I follow the rules for a while and it's good. But then I repeat the same mistake over and over again. It's to the point where my mom thinks that I'm doing things that I'm not 'Like disrespecting her in front of my friends because I think it's cool' even though I don't do it. I've tried to talk to her, but she doesn't want to listen, because she already believes that I do these things. It's too the point where I've almost kill myself in front of her twice, and even though I wouldn't do that. The stress is so much, and she calls me names that I don't want to the point where I couldn't control all my emotions.

Long story short, over the summer I was planning on driving my car over the edge of a cliff after I dropped some people off on vacation. I was overwhelmed in life and saw no way out aside from ending it all. Felt like a disappointment because I dropped out of college, worked as a personal trainer at a gym where I was taken advantage of and forced to work 16-17 hour days for pennies. Lived in some slummy apartments with no AC and barely had any grocery money. I usually bummed pizza from local Pizza shops at the end of the night when someone hadn\u2019t picked up a carry out order. Sometimes I\u2019d get something, sometimes I\u2019d get told to fuck off. Got on average 3 hours of sleep aside from Saturday nights. Mental health was at an all time low. I made some changes that started with therapy. After that, I got a lucrative new sales job, love the people I work with, practice Muay Thai weekly, work out every day, and am in a much better place mentally. If you think this post is about me rooting my own horn... You\u2019re right. I\u2019m damn proud of the progress I\u2019ve made. Whatever it is you\u2019re going through, keep fighting.

I had been trapped in my apartment for months with no job, money, or motivation. My mentality started shifting to something more cynical as well. One night in particular though, my boyfriend helped catalyze me getting better. It was insanely difficult to get out of bed. Sure I\u2019d get up maybe for an occasional snack or a quick bathroom break but I was just stuck mentally and physically, and in this case I hadn\u2019t left my mattress for days. I wasn\u2019t okay at all. Then one day out of the blue, my boyfriend went into my closet and grabbed me one of his t- shirts, (my) underwear, and (my) shorts. He propped me up and undressed, then dressed me while my eyes swelled up. He didn\u2019t even ask. He just did it. Every time I think about that moment I tear up because it was the most intimate and sweetest thing anyone has ever done for me. I really am so lucky to have such a caring man in my life. I can\u2019t wait to marry him some day. Our relationship is him doing the most selfless acts of love for me, and even though he might not think much of his actions, they mean the world to me.

Therapy saved me. But my therapist didn\u2019t. Here\u2019s what I mean. TL;DR please seek help if you are struggling, if you\u2019re unhappy, or even if you\u2019re happy and want to stay that way. There is a light. 3 years ago, my family home was foreclosed on. 2 years ago my mom had a stroke and was paralyzed and left unable to speak. 3 months ago she passed away after a long battle. I haven\u2019t been able to speak to my best friend for 2 years and now I\u2019ll never be able to. Within that time, I had two suicide attempts. I was on pills. I was drinking alone everyday. I was hospitalized. I was uninsured. I was homeless. I thought I was beyond repair. For two years now since then, I\u2019ve been in therapy. Every week for two years. Now, I\u2019m engaged. An awesome step son. I have a good job. A nice place to live. I\u2019m excited for the future. Therapy saved me. But not my therapist. My therapist is amazing. He\u2019s smart. Insightful. Knows when to listen. But when I started therapy, I thought my therapist would just tell me what to do. I\u2019d do it. And I\u2019d be fixed. That\u2019s not how it worked for me. A lot of my friends who aren\u2019t in therapy have been afraid to, or too stubborn to go seek help. They think they know better than a professional. BUT HERES THE RUB: My therapist didn\u2019t know how to fix me. I did. (For me personally) therapy has been about bringing out repressed thoughts and feelings. Things I couldn\u2019t talk to my friends about. Couldn\u2019t talk about with my family. Therapy also made me take accountability. For all my mistakes, the people I\u2019ve wronged. I can now accept my past and look to the future. A future I wanted to take away from myself. I hope if even one person reads this and feels inclined to help themselves. Because you can. P.S.

Maybe not now, maybe not immediately but they eventually will! Don\u2019t give up! Although I myself still struggle after being raped nearly 2 and a half years ago (and the rape will impact me my whole life) I want to let you know that time really heals wounds. After, I got raped it was the worst time in my life. There are no words to describe how horrible it was. From a person who was very confident, lived in multiple countries, travelled the world I was afraid to go to my local grocery shop. I nearly had a panic attack when I was alone with a man in a shopping aisle. I had to postpone all my exams, my academic and social life suffered immensely. I had PTSD, anxiety, depression etc. I had very dark thoughts. I considered taking a year out of university because just getting out of bed was a struggle for me. I could write a book about all the negative effects of rape. But now I honestly feel so much better. Of course, I still suffer the effects. But compared to the past I have made great progress. I am planning to continue my therapy though as I feel like my healing process is not over. But I want to let you know that things will get better. I have graduated from top 30 university in the world with a prestigious degree, last year I was a committee member of multiple societies at my university. I am looking forward to life. One thing I would tell you is that don\u2019t put a timeline or deadline for your recovery. And don't compare yourself to others. I used to wonder will I ever get better. Why I am not getting better already? Why is it taking so long? Don\u2019t compare your recovery to someone else. Although I will recover the whole of my life, what I mean is that If you are not getting better/progressing in a certain period of time is okay. Everyone is different and take as much time you need to heal. For me, it was also hard to see all my friends enjoying life and this tragedy happening to me. But now I am slowly accepting that life didn\u2019t turn out exactly the way I wanted. And bad things happened to good people.

It has been two weeks, I was basically out of money in a new city, have searched everywhere for a job but couldn't find any, so I decided to go to the social services center at the town hall to see if they could help me anyway. Shared with the staff my story and how I was going to be homeless that same day, but since it is a small city, the social worker contacted a friend of hers that owned a place that was looking for a woman to cook, clean and receive guests at a private tourist attraction. Although I'm male, she decided to give me a chance, and so it has been two weeks of hard work but everything is working out so far. I actually like the job a lot, and my employer seems to be quite happy with my performance and already increased my salary from past week. My anxiety and depression are way under control now. It seems that since my work requires more doing and less thinking it just keeps my mind better focused in the job and been glad for this opportunity that while I still get some intrusive thoughts once in a while, they are way less aggressive than they were in the past few months/years. So that is it. Just sharing a story with a better ending than I expected so that, maybe, it give those of you guys who are still facing harder times, a glimmer of hope that things may get better for you too.

I suppose that\u2019s a good thing that I\u2019m so involved with the good bits of life now that I almost forgot that this wasn\u2019t always the case. Ten years ago I threw my legs out a 6th floor window at college, intending to hit the earth below me. I was in the thick of some really terrible times then. I was 19, heartbroken, homesick, lost, and very confused. I remember the sharp air that rushed in the room when I opened the window that very cold and snowy February night. It felt like little needles on my skin; a stark contrast to the hot, salty tears streaming down my face. I was in trouble for drinking on campus...again. However, the drinking wasn\u2019t just purely fun and games. I was using it to cope with a lot of uncertainty and hopelessness. My on again off again boyfriend told me he was dating someone else. He lived with my best guy friend at the time so a lot of \u201csides\u201d were taken in the whole mess. And somewhere along the way my roommate moved out. I was alone. I spent the remainder of the week at the hospital under psychiatric care. The days I spent there blur together now. I was in such a haze of numbness. My entire life was uprooted. I got kicked out of college and I had to start over somewhere new. The next several years were spent kicking my ass into gear to show myself and the friends who abandoned me that they didn\u2019t get the best of me. I pushed and pushed myself. I started looking forward and not backward. I learned to love myself again. Slowly. Very slowly. I graduated from a new (and better) college with honors two years later. I took a chance and bought a one way ticket to NYC and began living the life I used to only be able to dream about. 10 years later, I am living proof that things get better. Depression and anxiety are challenges I still deal with occasionally, but now I know how to handle it. Right now I\u2019m sitting in the house I just bought all by myself. I\u2019m reminiscing about the years I spent living and working in Manhattan, where I had an incredible job and amazing friends. Most days, my life felt like a happy movie. I recently decided to re-locate, slow things down and enjoy the present. Now I\u2019m in the process of renovating my house from the inside out. I volunteer with an organization that raises funds for underprivileged women and children. I carve out time for my hobbies, friends, and loved ones. I\u2019ve truly become a better person. I can now enjoy a glass or two of wine without overdoing it just to cope. I can take a deep breath, a small sip, and appreciate how far I\u2019ve come. I still have a long way to go. I\u2019m still a work in progress. I haven\u2019t found love yet but I look forward to the day I do. In the meantime, you can catch me cultivating my new herb garden and reading a good book or two. If you\u2019re going through what I went through 10 years ago, my best advice is to hang on, know it does get better (and no this isn\u2019t something that people just say. It\u2019s true). You\u2019re not alone. You\u2019re loved. And you\u2019re stronger than you think.

I'm 19, a fifth-year law student and i still feel like a child trapped in a role i never asked for. Ever since i was little, i was the one doing the chores. My parents made me do things way beyond my age like washing other's underwear at 8 or cooking when i was barely in middle school. If i refused or didn't do it well enough i got severely punished. I think these experiences traumatized me because my memories are foggy but i know lots of things like that happened. Now that my mom has a small shop, she expects me to take care of everything at home whenever i don't have classes. I have to wake up early, stay at the shop, clean and cook sometimes. Our house isnt really small so i feel like i do endless physical labor, yet it's never enough for them. Meanwhile, my siblings make a mess and throw things everywhere and i have to clean up after them constantly. They're 18 and 14. When i try to talk to my mom about how exhausting it is, she just dismisses me saying things like \"you think you're just going to live here for free ?\" or \"you should do that because you're always asking for money anyway \". As if i owe them something just for existing. I get that parents provide for their kids but isn't that what they chose to do by having children ? Why does she expect me to handle her responsibilities ? I already help way more than i should i think. And yet, i feel like im losing my time and my youth for nothing because i can't do anything else (they don't really let me, mostly if it requires money) and i don't even earn anything from all this. I mean we''re not even poor i can tell that we're kind of stable. That's why im always frustrated and irritated. And when i express it suddenly im the villain because they don't understand why i feel this way. But im not just physically tired im also mentally exhausted. I can't do anything for myself. I can't even read a book without being interrupted because people come to shop at the grocery. I feel like i have no space, no freedom, nothing of my own.

And also living in the mountains everywhere is a drive and job hunting is torturous. It feels like everything is sorted out right now but I just cant seem to stop having these crying fit every few minutes thinking about what I should do with my life. Im stuck with this feeling that I lost out on a future for myself. Id like to go back to school to maybe learn either vet tech or maybe data analytics but it feels impossible to do anything(living in the US).

But i am not really successful but what makes good for me that it doesn\u2019t require interactions and socialising. I never had career dream honestly, but i come from family which makes below average and my parents are getting old so my destiny is to work everyday and night. But I don\u2019t want that.

I don\u2019t like my job and I don\u2019t want to lose it and become poor. I don\u2019t know should i change my career path but i am kinda scared bc my degree is so useless (it was a mistake). Honestly i blame my parents bc they were always broke and now i am also like that. I don\u2019t own anything except phone and clothes.

I've tried to get a degree in uni but can't keep going, I've been trying to open my own shop in my area and of course it failed miserably, All I knew and did to earn money successfully for my whole life was farm game currency to sell for a smidgen of real cash while taking a loan to help keep me going and I had enough of it.

I\u2019ve been dealing with depression since I was 10\u2026So basically half my entire life, add self harm and substance issues into the mix as well. I had been doing so good since about 2023 after my last \u201cattempt\u201d and stopped sh completely as well. I got into a beautiful and healthy relationship and we\u2019ve been together for over a year. I recently moved out of my parent\u2019s house (I\u2019m 20 now btw). I also have an amazing job in a hospital doing ect (no I don\u2019t shock people\u2019s fucking brains). For the past ~few~ months it\u2019s been getting bad again, I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d start sh again but I failed that a couple weeks ago. I kept everything functional, I reached out when I needed it. I still go to work, take care of my cat and other household chores, as well as my relationships. I still however feel an overwhelming sense of emptiness, I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m meant to be alive and I\u2019ve had this recurring thought since I was a kid. I never understood what being a human was like, I\u2019ve always felt misunderstood and like an alien just wasting a spot on this earth.

Got a job a degree and I went to work and I made money. All of it was supposed to make me happy. It really didn't. I just felt like a prison of my own making. All of you young people are experiencing depression I can tell you it really doesn't get better. As you get older, it really just gets worse.

I worry most about my height and my hair. I recognize it could be far more worse, but I can\u2019t stop feeling like I\u2019ll never be happy. I can't interact with attractive people without feeling intensely envious or unhappy. I wish I didn\u2019t care at all, but I do to an unhealthy extent. The fact that ugliness is still socially acceptable to mock just makes this nightmare feeling even more real. It\u2019s crazy how, even in my own friend group, the tallest guy is the most respected and happiest, while the shortest has the most problems in his life. I mean, I can\u2019t count how many times the jokes write themselves. I know I'm overly sensitive, and posting about my problems online probably isn\u2019t the best idea, but what other options do I have? Mindfulness, SSRIs, and CBT didn't help at all. How happy can you really be when you know you're not separate from nature and your chances of experiencing 'love' are determined by things entirely outside of your control? The only thing that actually makes a difference is socializing with people I feel close to. But no matter how hard I try, I can't seem to move past the acquaintance phase now. All my old friends moved on to different colleges, and now I spend my time online and alone, struggling to care about my future, knowing it's just going to get worse with age.

I\u2019m on academic probation and failing out of school. I was recently hospitalized with 7 stomach ulcers and I am through intense mental and physical health struggles. I\u2019m in therapy twice a week and on medication, but things keep getting worse. My single mom had to take on over $100k of debt to keep me in school, and she doesn\u2019t have a job. I\u2019m terrified for us financially. We\u2019ve always struggled, but it feels like everything is collapsing this year. I\u2019ve also been involved in a traumatic family lawsuit since I was 8 years old, and over the past year I\u2019ve had to take an active role in it. I\u2019m still waiting on a judgment related to finances that we were depending on, and I\u2019ve heard nothing. Because of the case, my grandfather suddenly stopped talking to me and cut me off emotionally and financially. The stress has caused my mom and I to fight so much she\u2019s lovely but so stressed herself. To make things worse, my younger brother hasn\u2019t spoken to me in over a year since I came out to him as gay. He was the one person I thought understood me \u2014 now I feel like I\u2019ve lost him too. I feel like I can\u2019t go home to take time off of school because it will lead to so much fighting with how my mental health is. I\u2019m not rlly able to do anything at all. I quit my dance team, distanced from friends, and feel like I\u2019ve withdrawn from everything. Even my previously happy and healthy relationship is struggling now due to all this stress. My dad left when I was 8 and has never spoken to me since. My family feels broken, and I feel completely alone in the world. I know I\u2019m doing what I can \u2014 therapy, medication \u2014 but nothing seems to touch the pain of losing family, financial safety, or the legal stress. I just don\u2019t know where to begin.

At first I am in a big group of students who came from the same country like me. But then I feel like I came all the way here so I want to make more domestic friends. So me & my bff isolated ourselves from the group & just go together so there\u2019s two of us only. We tried out many things together & lives have been better because we are meeting more meaningful people. However, we never truly make any more friends whom we could hang out with, it\u2019s always just a \u2018waving & hi\u2019 with them. I have only her & she has only me, which is kinda frustrating sometimes because if she\u2019s busy im alone & if im busy she is. Today my college has a big event going on and the party is very big. I want to go to a party at 12a & have fun but she wants to go to bed. I know why she don't want to go. Because every time she went out in a frat, we just like, just two of us dancing together. And it's so hard to talk to people in a frat, especially when you don't know them beforehand. They're sticking to their own friend groups. It's not like you can make friends with strangers. We've been to many frat parties, but it's not working out. That's why we stepped back a little and she lost hope with it. But I still want to go and enjoy the fun & I dont rlly care if we talk to anyone or not I want the music and the vibe of youth. I have no one else I could go with, so I have to stay at home, I am so upset because everyone else was screaming & happy & enjoying the party outside I could hear the noise, and Im in my bed miserable wanting to go but I cant because my only friend doesnt want to.

This may sound minor but ever since then, I have not been the same. I've taken so many substances, that I never thought I would try. When I was 11, I wanted to be a Doctor. That's what I thought about when I was stood with a rolled up note in my hand hovering over lines of crystal meth. My husband has always been a supporter of me taking drugs. So many sleeping tablets, that I can't remember life before my husband. The latest shit storm I've been dragged into, another court case is this week. I've never broken the law and it makes me so so sad that the authorities are always in my life. I work and my husband does not, I'm so so sad that I long to be left alone. But this doesn't happen, in a way I think the job is the only thing keeping me here. Ive tried to make us both happy, I took us on 2 breaks away to Europe and as soon as we got to the the hotel on each break, my husband would not speak and would limp around both cities shouting with pain that he didn't have at home.

Hey everyone, I\u2019m a 20-year-old guy, still living with my parents and my little sister. My mom doesn\u2019t work anymore; she\u2019s always at home. She has mental health issues, like thinking everyone is out to get her. To explain what kind of relationship I have with her: in the past, I fell into depression. We went to a psychiatrist, who prescribed me antidepressants. But she wasn\u2019t satisfied with my diagnosis. She desperately wanted me to have bipolar disorder, even though I clearly didn\u2019t. She took me to several other psychiatrists, lying about me so they would prescribe neuroleptics. She even tried to convince me that I was bipolar. Then, she tried to convince everyone else that I was crazy and had anger issues, even though I obviously didn\u2019t. She told people that if she was sick, it was only because of me. She even told them she was scared I was going to kill her in her sleep. My sisters took her side, and my dad didn\u2019t care. When I talked to him, he just said, \u201cBut your mom is sick, you\u2019re always messing with her, it\u2019s your fault.\u201d Even though I was just minding my own business in my room. When she got tired of me, she would send me to the psychiatric hospital. We kept going until we ended up back at the first psychiatrist, who told her that being \u201csick of me\u201d wasn\u2019t a good enough reason to admit me to a hospital. She was also an alcoholic when I was a kid. Now you see what kind of mother she is. (My dad is no better.) They always hated me. When I say that to my close friends, they always tell me, \u201cNooo, they don\u2019t really hate you, they\u2019re your parents.\u201d But please believe me when I say they really do hate me for NO reason. I\u2019ve always been calm, introverted, and tried my best to please people. Now, here\u2019s what just happened, and it scares me. First, you should know that I\u2019m in student debt because they paid for my sister\u2019s school but refused to pay for mine. I stopped talking to my mom for a week because she wanted me to organize her medication. I said okay. It took two hours. And at the end, instead of thanking me, she looked at me with disgust and said, \u201cPff, I\u2019m sure you hid Xanax in your pockets,\u201d as if I were a drug addict. So I told her to apologize, or I would stop talking to her. She still didn\u2019t. This afternoon, I was just making an apple pie in the kitchen. I thought people would be happy about it, lol. While I was doing it, she said stuff like, \u201cPff, I\u2019m sure he\u2019s doing it just to piss me off,\u201d because usually, I\u2019m not allowed to stay in the same room as her for too long, or she sees it as provocation. Then, she suddenly stormed into the kitchen, crying and yelling because I added more dishes to the sink (even though I was going to wash them). She completely lost it, screaming that I was \u201cdoing everything I could to ruin their lives,\u201d that \u201cthey couldn\u2019t stand me anymore,\u201d etc. My apple pie needed ten more minutes in the oven, but she started shouting, \u201cNO, I CAN\u2019T WAIT TEN MORE MINUTES WITH YOU HERE! LEAVE THE ROOM!!!\u201d I wasn\u2019t even talking, just washing the dishes. Then my dad told me I was making them crazy. I told him I was just minding my own business, and he said, \u201cMaybe that\u2019s the problem.\u201d And he said to back up my bags and that by tomorrow I should not be in the house anymore Guys, whatever I do, they always have something to say. They just want me gone. He said they were going to kick me out. It reminded me of when my mom tried everything to send me to a hospital when I was too young to be kicked out. \u2e3b Now, I know they really will kick me out. I don\u2019t know what to do. I have 6\u20ac in my bank account. I\u2019m in debt, and my studies take a lot of time. I tried to find a weekend job because I knew my situation at home was unstable, but I couldn\u2019t find one. I\u2019m so scared. I also don\u2019t have any friends that could help me. And I don\u2019t have family because my mom fought with her entire family, so we haven\u2019t spoken to them in years and years. What do you recommend I do? You might say I should work, and yes, I should probably keep looking for a job. But if I only work weekends, will I make enough to afford rent, food, and my 300\u20ac/month debt payments I'll have to start paying very soon? The big problem is that I\u2019m in med school, and my studies will last for a long time. I think I\u2019ll get a (low) salary in my 6th year, but right now, I\u2019m only in my 2nd year. (Side note: I haven\u2019t had a proper meal in more than a week because they don\u2019t make food for me and won\u2019t let me cook. I\u2019ve just been eating garbage\u2014cookies, snacks, whatever I can find. At school, I can\u2019t eat lunch because I don\u2019t have enough money in my bank account.)

It's as if I were under attack in my own bunker. I spent my childhood being rejected by others; every time I think back to my childhood, I imagine myself alone at the foot of a tree in my old school on a gray-sky morning. I had my first depression at the age of 9, following a violent argument between my parents in which my father threatened to kill me and my mother. I began to experience more and more harassment and rejection at the age of 11. At the age of 12, my mother went to hospital for over-medication. She came out of it without any after-effects, but afterwards my father often asked her to go to the pharmacy to get the same medicines for him. One day, I overheard a horrible telephone conversation between my mother and my half-sister. My mother was crying and told my sister that she suspected my father had pushed her to take more medication. Today, my life is hell, I'm filled with hatred and a horrible feeling of powerlessness in the face of all these injustices. All I do with my fucking life is walk alone in perfect solitude.

On top of that i only have like 3 friends maybe. i've never been social or good at making friends (i've been friends with all of them since i was a kid). at the beginning of second semester of freshman year i had to talk to a probation officer about my absences and was almost put on probation, but i kept missing school. even after being threatened with probation, cps, and juvie i continued to skip. I HATE SCHOOL AND ANYTHING ABOUT IT. when sophomore year started last fall it started good. i was somewhat happy with my classes and wasn't skipping a lot. my school has a rule that if you miss 4 or less days you don't have to take finals and every semester i strived to miss less the 4 days but of school that never happened until last fall i had miss 4 days so i could miss anymore and one day in november i skipped again. then it all started again i started skipping a lot again and my grades slipped and when school ended my mom signed me up for online school. i started doing online school in january but never really did it (idk why i just couldn't). and eventually i was kicked out of online and for the past month i haven't gone to school at all and i've just been laying in my room feeling depressed. i've fucked myself for life with what i've done to myself. i'll probably never be able to come back from this academically or mentally and honestly feel like there no reason for me to go on. if i can't even go to school or do my work then i'll never be able to have a job or work. my whole life i've felt like somethings wrong with me. when i was little my dad loved my stepmom or than me i felt unlovable and developed self esteem issues at a very young age. i've always felt ugly and boys never have really showed interest in me, rather people around me. i also feel dumb from failing classes but because all my friends are very smart (my best friend is top of the class) so i have always felt pressured. also i have 2 cousin that are in my grade who do really well academically and athletically so my grandma i live with is always comparing me to them. i used to be so happy and do well in school and i even played sports. i played softball for 8 years but eventually my mental health got in the way of that as well. mental illnesses run in my family and so does addiction so i've been doomed since before i was born. i've suspected that im mentally ill for a while (since i've always felt like something's wrong with me) and i think i might have depression. i sit in my room all day by myself, because that's the only way i'm happy. i'm only happy when i'm alone or so that's what i thought but i'm starting to think that's just what i'm used to and i've just adapted to that feeling and think its happiness. (i hope that makes sense). But truly the only way i'm happy is when i'm high and i'm not trying to sound like a pothead, but i've been smoking since i was 13 so it's became a coping mechanism i guess. also weed is the only thing that helps me sleep so when i did go to school i would have to get violently hugh ever night just to be able to sleep. i tried to start self harming when i was 12 but could never bring myself to cut myself, making me feel like a pussy. when i was 14 is when i actually started self harming. i would burn myself with cigarettes and still do it to this day. almost 2 years later and nobody has ever noticed. NOT A SINGLE SOUL HAS NOTICED SCARS OF MY ARMS AND LEGS. i'm starting to think i should burn myself in more noticeable places so people will notice and actually believe that i'm struggling and not a lazy failure. a call of help i guess but i don't want to seem like an attention seeker. and i think i might be starting to get addicted to it because i like the way it feels and the scars. since i've been out of school in december i've started eating less because i don't eat lunch at school anymore. i don't eat breakfast or lunch and hardly ever eat dinner. i usually just eat a snack once or twice a day or sometimes nothing at all. i've actually lost over 10 pounds because of this and i weight about 80 something pounds now and the bmi says i'm underweight. like i said earlier i struggle with self esteem issues so i don't like that way i look. i've been extremely skinny my whole life and was often praised for it as a kid, so now it's nailed in my head i have to been skinny and petite. when i was a little kid i was short, skinny, blonde, blue eyed, and had a perfect smile thanks to my fake teeth. i'm starting to think i might be anorexic or am developing it because on top of loosing that weight i have also lost my appetite and often have to force myself to eat. my period have became irregular and almost didn't have one last month, which i know happens when someone is anorexic. i spend a lot of time in the mirror looking at myself, and i hate how i look. thin lips, dead dyed hair, dark circles, bad skin, crooked teeth, everything. i also spend alot of time looking at my body. i hate how flat i am but also love being skinny. i know this isn't nice but i'm scared to become fat and often see myself bigger then i am. i only feel skinny when i can see my ribs poking through my skin, but i hate how skinny my legs and arms are. i find myself caking on tons of makeup just to feel a bit pretty. i hate my smile because my teeth are crooked. as i little kid i had to get caps on my real teeth because they were rotting or something. my teeth were perfectly straight and SO WHITE, but now are just crooked and yellowish. i haven't been to the dentist in 8 or 9 years and i have cavities i think. when i was a kid my dad enjoyed pulling my teeth out for some weird reason so as i got older i stopped talking about my teeth period with anyone and i didn't even touch my loose teeth. i would let them fall out on their of or wait for the new tooth the grow above it, creating crowding with my teeth. now i'm almost 16 and haven't even lost all my teeth yet. i've tried talking to people but nobody understands me. i've never met anyone who's gone through the same things as me. none of friends growing up and now didn't have split parents, none of them were abused, or lived in a dysfunctional household. not even my parents or siblings understand cause they didn't go through it. anytime i try and talk about how i'm feeling to my mom or grandma they just bring up school and remind me that i'm a failure. i've been asking to go to the doctor for over a year and they say they'll take me but they never do, no matter how much i've cried,begged, and pleaded...literally. i have broke down in tear multiple times just begging for help and nobody does anything. Nobody has really ever asked me what's wrong or something like that. not friends. not teachers. not even my family. i feel so lost and different from everyone else and i just want help. im actually starting to blame my mom for that way i am. because if she just took me to the doctors like she promised i probably wouldn't be writing this right now. i don't know what to do anymore help or a doctor is not and option anymore and i can't talk to anyone. i tried to kill myself last year but absolutely it didn't work and i've been contemplating suicide again for a while now. i'm never gonna be anything or do anything in life so i feel like there's no point. everyday i live just feels like a chore at this point and i'm tired of vacuuming the same spot everyday if you know what i mean. so i guess i'm coming to reddit or help or answers. if you have questions i'd be happy to answer them. i honestly have no idea what to do with myself.", "1jhfj3p": "I'm not sure what to do with my life right now I've been feeling really lost, unmotivated, and numb lately.

I met this girl who lives in different county and we fell in love with each other she is the most beautiful soul and we then were in a relationship for 6 years multiple apartments. In 2023 we brought a beautiful baby girl into this world. I struggled with alcohol addiction extremely badly and was a horrible person to her and everyone not a good partner especially as it came to helping with our child. I made a grave mistake as I was blacked out one night that changed my life for ever and ended me up incarcerated. I changed my life around the best of my ability with meetings and groups of such but was given 3-4 months no contact with her or my child only seeing my baby through a picture frame. Fast forward to today somewhere along the way we re connected and moved into a new apartment and I thought things were well but they weren't. She was never able to heal from the damage I MYSELF caused to now where before 2025 started I came home to an empty apartment and have been left abandoned. She was my everything and helped me with everything in life in every aspect of my life even my extreme ocd.

I'm a young man with depression. As much as I hide it, I do have it. I pretend I am fine when I'm not, when in actuality, I'm taking my anger, frustration, and sadness out on everyone else the moment they do anything at all. A bit of backstory; Last year, my girlfriend dumped me after lying to me for a very long time, lying to me for years. She also cheated on me, and every few weeks, I find out that there is another guy or girl that she cheated on me with. She's also began to accuse me of mentally abusing her, which I never did. Then, because of her, I nearly got my safety threatened at my own job, and when I'm just walking around in public. I've been happy at times since she dumped me and everything became public, VERY HAPPY, but I'm still depressed. It always comes back to depression. I'm stressed beyond far, I'm constantly injured, I'm hurt all the time, and no one cares to listen to what I've got going on. And then a bunch of people turn around and judge me, bully me STILL, speak to me like shit, and tell me to kill myself. And that's when I've been getting angrier than myself lately, and often fighting these people, when I'm not a man who fights because someone said something about me. I prefer to always play it smart and not engage in a fight, as it lowers me to the aame level as the fuckwit that wanted to fight. But lately, I haven't been able to play it smart, or safe. Am I an asshole for saying all of this? Am I an asshole for exposing my ex girlfriend? Who cares.", "1jh6uv0": "I regret moving I guess I should be grateful. For the past three years (except this one), people have defended me, even after the one time I lashed out at them. I still don't know why they always chose to stand up for me. Every time I got in trouble with the teachers or just in general they would defend me. This year, my fourth and final year in junior high, I've been avoiding people and skipping as many classes as I can. I still get in trouble a lot for not doing well in school. I lost my motivation ever since I moved away from them. I used to be a student who scored in the 90s, a straight-A student even, but now my grades have fallen below 80, with my lowest being 74 which is already a failing grade here, since passing is 75. Not only that, but I'm starting to hate my classmates, which makes me want to skip even more classes. In class, the teachers get pissed off easily, and my classmates butt in just to insult or yell at me. It really shows how toxic people can be when they have numbers on their side. So this year, I've been completely alone in class. I never even leave the house. I'm practically a shut-in who only goes to school unwillingly. And even when one of the people who used to defend me asked how I was doing, I was too afraid to even talk to him. In times like these, I can't help but wish I hadn\u2019t been born in the first place. Even when I was defended, I knew I'd eventually have to go back home. a place I never liked.

I am very lucky to have a car a job and a few close friends to keep me company and sane but sometimes the bad just overweighs everything.

I tried to end it but is too much of a fucking coward to do that too! Got a motorcycle recently so I'm planning to get into an accident soon one way or the other. I just need to make sure no one else gets hurt. I feel zero motivation, zero drive and has nothing to look forward. I still miss her. I miss holding hands and our bus rides when i kiss her on her forehead. I asked her for a swcond chance but she is too much hurt that she started seeing a therapist. I would have loved if she killed me with her own hands. Life is kicking me down. I can't get up. There is nobody to talk to. I want to go somewhere far away but then again change of environment won't solve my issues. I know that. I shouldn't have said yes. I shouldn't have been born. These days I'm just a walking, eating, shitting piece of flesh that has no sense of belonging, or worth.", "1jh406o": "Hi again Thought I'd give an update since the last time I posted was months ago but things have gotten better and worse at the same time. Every time I think I've got this living on my own thing down it's like everything gathers together to kick me back down. I live off a check I get from a booth my dad had before he passed away in a consignment shop but without him constantly going there to sell things in person, it's only bringing around $600 a month. And some times not even that. This month I made absolutely nothing, in fact I owed them money for the rent. That booth is the only income I have but if it keeps on like this I'll have to put a stop to it but if I do that I'll have no income whatsoever. The house is paid off thankfully so I don't have to worry about that and I applied for snap benefits as well so that has helped. But I'm just not sure how long I can keep going like this. My dad passed away late last September and since then I've held a gun to my head twice, thought about it even more but it was twice that I nearly went through with it. The reasons I haven't is because of my dogs and now my aunt. My uncle and I have been a huge burden on her, she comes here to help take care of my uncle, brings us food, and even helps clean the house some times. I don't have life insurance and I know if I died, all those bills for a funeral and all that would go to her. I'm enough of a burden to her as it is I don't want my death to be an even bigger burden. I wouldn't care if she tossed my body in the woods and forgot all about me but I know she wouldn't do that. So I'm back to playing the waiting game. Wait until I get life insurance, wait until my dogs pass away. I just hope I can make it until then, there are days when I feel like I can't. I'm not good at talking about my feelings with the people around me so no one knows any of this. Not even my best friend since I was in 2nd grade. (I'm 30 now) She's the only friend I have but it feels like I'm staying the same and she's moving on. She rarely talks to me anymore. She has other friends, a job, a life. We live pretty far from each other now, in different states, but we used to always talk over discord. Play games together and things like that. I've sent her messages but she hasn't responded to me since January. Not like I blame her, I'm sure I'm annoying her when I send her messages all the time but I just I don't really have anyone else to talk too. I really only leave the house once a month to pick up my check from the store and to pay bills. She's the only friend I have, I've never been good at making friends because of my social anxiety. The only person I see every day is my uncle but he's not really someone I can talk too. He has a mental disability due to seizures and because of that he has the mind of a 7 year old. I take care of him, not the other way around. I have a boyfriend but it's long distance and to be honest, I've built myself in his eyes as this always happy person, I've never told him or let it show how depressed I really am. I've never told him about my thoughts of wanting to die at all. I've tried to only show him the good in me and I'm scared that if I show him everything he'll think it's too much or he'll down play it. I've thought about telling him but for some reason I just can't bring myself too. I see my aunt every week but she's not someone I can really talk too either. Deep down I know she does care for me but another part of me thinks that the only reason she comes around so often is just for my uncle. If he wasn't here, she wouldn't be either. She's talked about him moving in with her because he has mobility issues and the our house is it's hard to get him out so if he ever has a medical emergency it'd be really difficult to get him to a hospital and I understand that, and I know it'd be easier for me money wise and all that if he did move in with her. But at the same time if that did happen I'd be completely alone. My aunt would have no reason to come by anymore and it'd just be me in this house. I'm already having issues trying to keep myself alive for the limited time frame I've given myself, I have no idea how much harder it'd be if I was alone. I don't know. At this point I'm just rambling.

Always judgy and those class pets too always snitching and calling out for petty reasons, ugh. Lost of something, My childhood. I am 14 now, which may not seem old but, it is in my country. I miss being a child I used to play outside without worrying anything. Lastly Recently I just wanted to play on my PC(laptop) I don't really get that much screen time on my laptop besides schoolwork, yet my mom yells at me for using it on quo on quote: \"it is using too much electricity\" mind her my dad is giving her more than half his salary.

Now I just mostly cry myself to sleep and thinking about shit.", "1jh3c8b": "I\u2019ve spent the past three years in hardship and all my efforts feel wasted & idk what to do now. Need advice. Soooooo. Where do I start? This is gonna be a long one. Back in 2022/2023 I was working in retail at a pet store. Not the greatest gig, but it was relatively stable. I was struggling with time demands because the work was physically intensive in terms of labor (Petcare) and I was working around 45/50 hours and I only had 15 minute breaks during my shifts. At the time I was able to meet financial deadlines, but I eventually got burnt out with everything else happening in my personal life. Hard disappointments from my dating life, an apartment flood, and not being able to really take care of myself or my own creative pursuits. I worked and worked and worked, and then I had more and more time difficulties. Even if I was getting the rest I needed, i would flounder and loose myself and crawl back to bed. I sometimes would routinely pull all nighters because I\u2019d miss getting to work on time. Eventually I got one of those angry vibrating alarm clocks. That didn\u2019t help either. Eventually I got fired (on my birthday of all days) this past year. Couldn\u2019t get unemployment so while job searching I decided to pick up sex work as a \u201cmasseuse.\u201d Did get routine clients. Was making some kind of money, but not enough and I was behind on my bills. Eventually I got a hosting gig at a restaurant next door. Good people, meaningless work, still behind on bills. Spent the next few months getting my shit together and it was very hard. Then in November, I landed a really cute gig as a dresser for a touring company. I can\u2019t talk about who I was working with because they\u2019re prevelent figures in the arts and I don\u2019t wanna get sued. But the pay was good and I had friends I\u2019d be working with so sounded like an ok deal. I didn\u2019t expect how absolutely hard it was. So I traveled the US for thanksgiving and Christmas on a tour bus. I worked the hardest I ever had getting every performer dressed on time and que, moving garments and props, steaming, repairing, sewing, cleaning wigs and shoes, helping with makeup, being their therapist, their bartender, etc. I was exhausted. I\u2019d wake up get to work, run a marathon the whole day, and get back on the bus and cry in my sleep, then the next city, same thing, no off days, for 50 days. Some of the crew did not like me, I was ok with that, but the friend I had on tour now don\u2019t talk to me and idk what I did. I think I did the best I could for my skill set and first time on the road doing this kind of work which was unfamiliar to me. I have no hard feelings about it, but it stung a bit. The whole thing. I get back home with the bills paid at least, and get back to my life back at the restaurant after new years. My creative pursuits are solidifying more and I\u2019m working still. My finances are hitting a wall again despite me now picking up a new gig their doing data entry for invoices and tip pool. I\u2019m getting paid a lil tiny bit more, but I won\u2019t see that money until next month. I barely get hit up by my clients now minus 2 or 3 irregularly. I feel like I\u2019ve negotiated all I can with my landlord and I make myself go hungry and eat a free bread loaf from work. I keep looking for jobs the whole time and that\u2019s been annoyingly shitty. I\u2019m able to sleep, take my mind off things a bit, but I\u2019m running back around in my head. I\u2019ve been homeless before when my parents kicked me out after coming out as queer YEARS ago. I\u2019m afraid to talk to my family about my current struggles now, as they didn\u2019t want help me before. I managed myself, put in the fucking work, had some help along the way, and was able to make life better. I\u2019ve gotten through hard times like this and I know I\u2019m capable. But that just it, I\u2019m capable. I\u2019m resilient. I can do hard things. I\u2019m fucking scared shitless the whole time and life goes on. I\u2019ve done any kind of odd job you could think of, regardless if I was good at it or not. I don\u2019t live frivolously. I manage my time now a lot better. I eat rice & beans. I don\u2019t do drugs or drink or go out. I don\u2019t date. I just struggle. The hard work over these past few years has gotten me nowhere, and I\u2019m at a loss. I don\u2019t want to work harder anymore. I dont know what other skills I need to learn or incorporate into my life. I hate my own resilience & I don\u2019t know what to do anymore. I\u2019m tired. I\u2019m resentful. I\u2019m disappointed. I\u2019m enraged and I\u2019m starting to feel hopeless again. Sometimes I could either die and get the shit-show over with or burn the fucking world to the ground. Doesn\u2019t help that the state of politics right now just might make things worse for everyone, myself included. If you\u2019ve gotten this far, thanks. I never get on here for anything, but this is kind of my last ditch. I\u2019ve worked 22 hours so far the past two days of this work week, so maybe I\u2019m just tired. again. And, no. I don\u2019t want to die. The idea is just flirtatious to me every now and then.

Especially anger. I would just not take things personally or understand it could've been a mistake or that the other person just didn't mean it the way I perceived it. I use to break alot of controllers when I was young while playing video games. Or punch walls or the such. But by the time I was in highschool, I'd stop all that. And I got really good at letting things just slide, and moving on. Since I've started driving. I had never used my horn in a reactive way, I had only used it as a warning to let someone know they were about to hit me or something. But more recently, isolation has changed me. And I'm becoming bitter. I use my horn all the time now. And I usually lay on it. I punched a hole in my apartment wall last week, an apartment I had been living in for 4 years and not caused any damage to it up until that point. I also broke my TV could months ago out of anger. A TV that was 13 years old and had survived 6 moves, one of which was 800 miles. But what made me realize something was definitely wrong, was the other day in dicks sporting goods.. it was an off day at work. And I was feeling a bit anxious due to isolation. And thought that being around people might help, so I went to the shopping center in my town. Was just looking around dicks for a bit until I got bored and decided to go to Walmart. But wanted to get a drink on the way out. At check out. The lady was wearing a Philadelphia eagles bracelet. I was born in Philadelphia, so I'm also an eagles fan. But we are 800 miles away, so I don't see many down here. And I thought this was going to be a pretty easy chance for me to just strike up a conversation. No expectations of anything, just a chance for me to feel connected to another person for a second. But as I was about to say something. A man behind me in line put his items on the counter and was practically touching me as he spoke over the cashier as she was still telling me my total trying to strike up a conversation to me. And now usually I would just let this go and just move on. And some people might call me a push over for that. But idc, I don't have anything to prove to anyone. Except that's not what I did this time. I turned to the guy and shoved him a bit and \"asked\" if he could back the fuck up. He came forward at me and started to say something before a pushed him again nearly knocking him over. And then he calmed down. I then paid for my drink and left. I haven't been in any physical altercation in nearly 15 years. But I broke that streak the other day. I think part of me was hoping he'd been carrying as we're in the south.

When I was 11 we started middle school, we were still in the same class and all our classmates were trying to get us together, but we were pretty shy at that time so we didn't dare to \u00ab flirt \u00bb. Finally it was the following year, when I was 12 years old, that we got in relationship. Ofc the feelings I had for her weren\u2019t as strong as those I had for her when we grew up up because we were still young but I was so happy. She was the first girl I kissed, the only one actually. We kept growing up, we were always in the same class every year and we kept spending all of our time together. If I explain that, it\u2019s so that you understand that from my 5 to 19 years I almost spent every day of my life with her, she gradually became as essential as breathing for me. The more the years went by, the more \u00ab serious \u00bb (important to each of us) our relationship became. We never argue, ofc sometimes we didn\u2019t agree with each other but we knew how to put our differences aside and respect the point of view of the other. Then when I was 15 we started high school, at that time we were in a relationship for almost three years and people were amazed by the longevity of our couple, because at that age it\u2019s unusual. But we loved each other so much (and I still love her so much), it was like I had found the perfect person to me and I don't want to speak for her but I felt like I was perfect to her. We kept growing up, we did our first time together (and all the others, I never had sex with another girl). We wrote long love letters to each other, any pretext was good to say how much we loved each other. I mean, I'm kinda that clich\u00e9 of the chunk rugby player, people don't really imagine me doing that, yet for her I\u2018d have done anything and everything, she was so exceptional, I felt incredibly privileged to be part of her life. We graduated high school and that summer we moved into our apartment, then started university. I was so glad to live with her, to sleep with her every night. Of course our parents let us sleep together on weekends and holidays but it wasn\u2019t the same, it was a new step in our relationship and we were so happy. When I explained to my new mates from the university that I had been with my girlfriend for 6 years they were stunned, they asked me if I had never wanted to flirt with another girl or anything and the answer has always been no : since my childhood, I grew up alongside this exceptional girl and I always dreamed of being with her and I felt so lucky to be in a relationship with, I never even noticed any other girl. I found her perfect in every way. We were so happy. I just want to tell you a little bit about the great person she was. She was so heart warmed, she couldn\u2019t stand injustice. She always wanted to help others. She was so kind and caring. Whenever our friends needed advice or support for something she was the one they call, she was full of wisdom and good intentions. She was always smiling, she illuminated people's lives with her presence. She was a very funny person as well. She always saw the bright side of everything, she was so positive. She never gave up, she worked hard to reach her goals. She was so clever, I\u2019d even say brilliant, she was a very gifted student. She was passionate : when she did something she put her whole heart into it. She made people feeling special, she knew how to bring out the best in them. She always complimented everyone, she was adorable. She was also sensitive, she hated seeing the ugly things of the world, she could cry for that. But she was also someone who made the world more beautiful by her mere presence. I\u2019ve never met someone so selfless and altruistic. She was also incredibly beautiful, the most beautiful woman I\u2019ve ever seen. She was an angel, for her friends, for her family, for me, for my family who loved her too. My mam has three sons and she was used to say that Honey was like her daughter. My little brother was kinda an hooligan when he was younger and listened neither to my parents nor to me. She spent so much time helping him, because of her he really took control of his life again. Everyone loved her, literally. She was wonderful. She was someone who loved to pamper people. She could spend weeks making a gift or a surprise for someone, but she was always embarrassed when someone gived a gift to her. I think she was one of the few people who was sincere when they said they preferred to give than to receive. I felt so good with her, she was the love of my life, literally. I always wondered how she could love me so much, I mean I\u2018m not that bad and I always did my best especially for her but she was so much better than me. And yet she still looked at me like I was one of the wonder of the world. We were so happy. I was only 19 years old and yet I saw my life with her and she saw her life with me, we had lots of plans. And even beyond me, she was a great person, who was so young and had her life ahead of her. I mean, if we had broken up, it\u2019d have been incredibly hard but at least she would have kept existing, living, shining as she deserved. But I cannot bear what happened. We were together, so happy and in love, I never could have believed that she will disappear so quickly and in such a brutal way. No one deserves that and when it happens to someone so close to you, someone you love so much, it\u2019s extremely harsh. It was a Sunday and we were at our parents\u2019 for the weekend. Sometimes on weekends we slept together and sometimes we slept on our own and we just spent the day together. On Saturday evening we slept each on our own, her at her parents\u2019 and me at mine, there wasn\u2019t even a particular reason. On Sunday morning she wanted to run for an hour and offered me but I was lazy. I was tired, I wanted to stay in bed an hour more. It\u2019s absurd : I was studying sports science and I was too lazy to go running. I\u2018d never forgive myself. It\u2019s an ongoing case so I\u2019m not allowed to speak in detail about it and anyway it doesn\u2019t have to be, but she was violently assaulted and tortured and died, and then her body was burned. Suspects were arrested a few weeks later, it was in Feb 2019 and the trial was supposed to be in May 2020 but it was postponed because of the coronavirus (France is in quarantine). I cannot even describe the infinite pain I felt when a few days after his disappearance, while very important research was being carried out, her body was finally found and we knew what had happened to her, I had a blackout. Since I woke up from this fading away I have been taking heavy psychotropes, that doesn\u2019t prevent me from constantly having anxiety attacks and having to take a fuck ton of sleeping pills to sleep, otherwise I have awful nightmares. I never thought I\u2018ll fall so low one day, I have always been someone very happy and full-blown. But I never thought that the love of my life was going to be murdered one day either. I haven't been going to university since, I don't do anything except think about her all day, I saw a lot of therapist but they only say shit, how am I supposed to accept the sudden death of the person I love the most in the world and with whom I grew up believing that we were going to spend our lives together ? They tell me about the emotions of mourning but the only emotions I have are deep feelings of hopelessness and hatred towards those who did this. I feel even worse since I know who did this and what their \"reasons\" were, because they were people I knew. I feel devastated. Sometimes I want to kill myself and sometimes I want to avenge her by killing them. But I feel unable to inflict this pain on my parents, who are very friends with Honey's parents (They had been friends for a long time before, because we are neighbors) and who help them a lot to hold on since it happened, I can see that they have the fear is that I kill myself and to be in the same state as the parents of Honey. Her parents are suffering so much, they lost their only daughter and I don't know what to do to relieve their pain. Whenever I speak with them they seem so happy all of a sudden, they say that Honey kept living through me. But imo it's not true, she no longer lives and will never lives again and I miss her so, so much. But I know if they say that it\u2019s because they miss her so much too. She is missed by everyone who knew her, she was so wonderful. And I will always miss her. People tell me that one day when I\u2019ll be happy again and I\u2018ll meet someone else and go back to normal life. But I know it\u2019s wrong, first I\u2018ll never be happy again, how am I supposed to live without her after growing up with her ? She was as essential to me as breathing, it\u2019s unbearable to survive since she\u2018s no longer there, how can I resume a normal life ? And how can I meet someone else ? I never wanted when I was happy and she was there to meet someone else so it isn\u2019t now that I\u2018m desperate without her that I\u2018ll want to meet someone, plus she is irreplaceable. I feel devastated. She is the only one I want and yet I know she\u2018ll never come back. I constantly think of her, of her laughter, her smile, her scent. I bought her perfume and I spray it on my pillow every day, I know it's stupid but it's the only thing that helps me sleep a little better. I just wanna hug her again. Sometimes when people lose a loved one they say they regret not telling them how much they mean to them and at least I\u2019m \u00ab relieved \u00bb that Honey knew how much I loved her and how important she was to me when she passed away, because I told her every day. Just before the quarantine there was a commemoration for the one year of her death and everyone looked at me with pity. As I no longer go to class, in rugby or to see my friends I don\u2019t see anyone and I had not seen some people for several months, they were dazed by my appearance. And I hadn't realized but actually I became the shadow of myself, I always was very \u00ab strong \u00bb and now I\u2018m extremely bony. It depressed me even more to see how many people seemed concerned when they saw me. That's why I avoid my friends, they don't know what to say (and I understand that's normal, in their place I wouldn't know what to say either) and they\u2018re also embarrassed not to know what to tell me. The only person I used to open up to is Honey, and now having to deal with such difficult emotions without knowing to who open up is very painful. My family is trying to support me as much as they can but it's very hard, there was a very bad atmosphere at home, so much so that my parents broke up and my father went back to Ireland with my older brother. I feel like my mom and little brother don't know what to do with me anymore. But I don't know what to do with me either. I think that after the trial I\u2018ll go to Ireland for a while as well, just to take a break, here every time I go out everyone is aware of what happened, throughout the region (and even outside, but here they recognize me so they look at me with that pitying air that depresses me even more). I\u2019m not afraid of the judgement, I know they\u2018ll have a long sentence but I\u2018m very afraid of the trial in itself and to, during a week or two to, hear what she has been through in detail all day, to see her murderers and to hear what they\u2018re going to say, I\u2018m anxious I cannot bear it. For the moment I\u2019m trying not to think about it. I spend all my time in the tree hut that his father built between our gardens when we were younger. We spent all our time there, when we were teenagers and our parents didn\u2019t want us to sleep together we secretly met there and stayed all night. Everything remained as it\u2019s, when I\u2019m there I feel calmer. I feel like nothing can ever ease my pain, I don't even know why I came to tell my story here. I just needed to open up and I can't do it with my loved one. I don\u2019t think anyone will have read this anyway.", "jy2o4t": "Having wonderful, loving, supportive family doesn\u2019t make you any less depressed. I have two extremely loving parents, a supportive sister, and a handful of close friends who I know would always listen if I needed it. I am still extremely depressed and ready to end it all. I attempted suicide 4 years ago, ended up in the psych ward for 2 weeks, and my family and friends visited every day. I can barely function anymore. I try so incredibly hard every day to be normal, to work, walk, chat, and appear fine. Mentally, I am thinking about killing myself for hours every day. Today I lost it, blew off work, and slept the entire day. I cried to my mother and she cried with me. Asked me what I needed, willing to do anything, but it doesn\u2019t help. There isn\u2019t anything wrong with me. I\u2019m young, pretty, thin, and am capable of making friends and keeping them. I have a STEM degree, I\u2019ve had committed relationships. None of that makes me happy. The true tragedy of my life is that I know I could do more, be more, and I just cant. I\u2019ve been told I am strong because I haven\u2019t done drugs or drank, because I powered through my degree, because I haven\u2019t killed myself. I\u2019m not strong, I\u2019m guilted. Having a family who loves you and you love is a double edged sword. Love doesn\u2019t cure depression. It does wrack you with guilt if you even think of attempting it. It would destroy my family. I\u2019m not exaggerating. They have all told me individually, may times, that it would. My parents would never forgive themselves. I would haunt them forever. I tried therapy. After I got out of the hospital I was on anti-depressants. I tried different meds, I saw 4 different therapists. It all just made it so much worse. One of my therapists almost got me involuntarily recommitted to the hospital. Her talking to my parents and ensuring they would be picking me up and taking me home was the only thing that saved me. Even the \u201cgood\u201d therapists just made me feel worse. I would leave every appointment more depressed than I came in. I quit trying that after a year. The thing about therapy is that you are forced to lie. I was suicidal but couldn\u2019t talk about it. If they suspect anything you get the cops called on you and they forces you into the prison that is the psych ward. They force medication on you, get you fired from your job, and destroy whatever remnants of a life you had. My mother is a certified grief councillor. She volunteers in hospice and regularly supports grieving people. She can\u2019t help me. Talking to her is pointless. She will cry and beg me not to. It doesn\u2019t make me feel better, just guilty. All this rambling because the truth is that I am without hope. My family is dragging me through life. All the love in the world and it doesn\u2019t make a fucking difference. Drugs, therapy, doesn\u2019t matter. Depression is a death sentence and there is no cure. My only hope is to distance myself from them and one day just do it. Push them far enough away that they grieve me and move on. That way, killing myself won\u2019t affect anyone.

Its nice to feel understood.", "n2nqpm": "I called the suicide hotline, the lady seemed irritated and then abruptly put me on hold. I\u2019ve been very depressed and having intrusive thoughts.

I told her I have been depressed for a long time, my life, finances, family, job, everything is going terribly. I keep having the thought that it\u2019d just be easier to end it all. I\u2019ve been abusing alcohol heavily as well. She recommended therapy. I said I was going to therapy for a while, but it was expensive and didn\u2019t seem to help at all so I stopped going. \u201cUm, you can afford alcohol but you can\u2019t afford therapy?\u201d She audibly scoffed into the phone and put me on hold indefinitely.

It never fucking does. It\u2019s like I\u2019m haunted by my relatively uneventful past.

No more mistakes. No more disappointments. I\u2019m tired, I\u2019m tired of being tired, and I\u2019m tired of being tired of being.

I literally cannot remember a time in my life where I wasn't angry or unhappy with myself or how people treated me. I've had body issues since I was 8 years old because my grandparents overfed me and let me eat sweets all day, which led to me being outcasted by my peers and constantly criticised by my parents. I first started thinking about suicide when I was maybe 12 or 13 and 10 years later I still think about it. I don't think I've ever has a solid year of my life where I've thought that everything was going to be okay and life was worth living. I've had months of temporary relief from the constant pain, but thats all they were; temporary. I thought finding someone to spend my life with and who loves me unconditionally and puts up with my suicidal tantrums would fix me but it hasn't. I thought effectively curing my disfiguring autoimmune disease would help me have a new lease on life, but it hasn't. I have lots of friends, an attractive face, and I had a job I liked. No body in my personal life except for two people know that I struggle, and the rest would never guess it. I have nothing to be sad about, really, I have an objectively easy life. But that doesn't matter, I am depressed and I always will be. I could have the perfect body, my dream job, have millions in my bank account and I'd still feel exhausted.

I'm shared custody from my mom to my dad. My dad is very abusive towards me. I've been diagnosed with depression and PTSD and I've gone to the hospital twice over suicide attempts because every time I'm with my dad I want to kill myself. He pushes me to the limit and I'm afraid that. Ever since I was little, my dad has always beaten me with a belt. Even before I was old enough for school. My dad has beaten me for not doing what I was told to do. He yells curse words at me and uses my mother as an example of what not to be. And that makes me feel sad because I miss my mom. Recently, my grades dropped. I've been having problems at school. I have a hard time focusing and paying attention to what I'm being taught. My dad was pissed. One moment he\u2019s screaming at me and cursing me out and telling me I won't achieve anything in life. And telling me I'm going to regret it when he\u2019s done with me. My 11 year old brother also made a bad grade, so he walked into my brothers room and I heard screaming and loud sound from my dad hitting him with a belt. Then he walked up to me and told me to give him my hand. I held my hand out and he hit me extremely hard with the belt. I screamed and held my hand, but he told me to hold my hand out again he continue to do it over and over again. Then he told both of us to come in the kitchen. He started yelling at us saying he was in an \"ass whooping mood\" and that he'd beat us whenever we felt like it. That if we didn't care about our grades he wouldn't care either. That he'd make us feel his pain. He hit me extremely hard. My hand was red and swollen. I had a bruise on my wrist that was slightly swollen and stung to the touch. He told me to hurry and wash the dishes before he'd do it again. And he did. But my hand hurt too badly. He threatened to hold me down. I'm going to kill myself if I have to continue to live with him. I cannot take this anymore and no one will do anything about it, I decided that when I go back to my mom's on Sunday I am refusing to go back to my dad's. This is what it's come to because he refuses to cooperate and my mom doesn't have enough money to get a lawyer and free legal aid takes too long. So I am not going. I know my dad will call the police if I don't go. When they come, I will talk to them and tell them my situation. Can they force me to go? What will they do? Because in order to get me to go they would have to physically drag me. I am in fear of my life and I don't want to die but he just pushes me to that limit so I just can't be around him. I don't know how many times I've tried to tell my dad this and even my therapists have tried to tell him this. He doesn't care, he simply denies treating me the way he does saying he's never called me the things he does on a daily basis like dumbass, idiot, son of a b\\*\\*\\*, and he even calls my brother those things and denies it.

Only been to one party. Never hooked up. Never had a relationship. The only things I have going for me are my writing and my drawing, and even then I'm losing interest in those as well. I don't blame women. I don't blame men either. It all lies with me. My family isn't any better. I've tried talking about this to them multiple times. I can predict exactly what they say: \"this too shall pass\", \"believe what you want to believe\" \"if you believe it won't happen, it won't.\" Yeah, great.

Every time I try to leave, they threaten to call the cops. I have nowhere to go, no source of income.

One is in an Ivy League school and the other is going to a nice university. They both get good grades, have a social life, and know where they're going in life. Meanwhile my mom got stuck with a total wastoid that sits around all day on his phone. I don't drive, don't have a job, don't really wash myself unless it's been a few days or I have to go out somewhere. I have severe ADHD and don't really do well taking basic classes. I just feel so guilty that this is what my mom gets to deal with. She always tells me about how it was such a magical moment when I was first born. And I just think \"if only she knew how I would turn out.\" It wasn't her fault, though. She is such a loving caring person. She didn't deserve this. Anytime my dad comes home from work I have trouble even looking him in the eye because I know I'm probably such a disappointment in his eyes. I act normal around him but the anxiety and dread is always there in the background. I wish I could just kill myself and end the bullshit, but that would just hurt them even more. No matter what I do, everybody loses.", "hzah5n": "Im begging somebody to read this I desperately need to feel like I have a friend there for me right now. Posting this on a few subs because I don\u2019t know what to do. I feel like I\u2019ve reached my breaking point. Im so tired. I\u2019m so tired of existing. I\u2019m so tired of being mad. I\u2019m so tired of being tired. It\u2019s pathetic. I\u2019m a 25 year old adult who\u2019s stuck living at home with my family. I can feel myself falling apart and I\u2019m reaching the point where I\u2019m finally just going to take myself out of this shitty game called life, or I\u2019m going to end up cutting ties all together with my family, which is where I\u2019ll probably sink. If it\u2019s sink or swim out in the big world. I am holding on to so many grudges. From so many years. That I clearly can\u2019t cope with in a healthy way.

I realize that I spent probably the first 18 years of my life. Living in literal fear of my pseudo racist father. I still remember being 6 years old or so and hearing my mother scream for my brother because my father was choking her in their bedroom. Was a big steroid fan back in the day. I spent most of my middle school and high school career grounded from one semester to the next one because I frequently got C\u2019s in school which my parents would ground us for. Even one C on the report card and it was grounded for the rest of the semester. I still remember getting in trouble so badly for lying about doing my homework, not even so much for not doing my homework. But it was distinctly about lying about it. My father was beating me in our dining room and at one point was physically choking me against the wall, and I remember my mother saying \u201cwell Don\u2019t choke him (insert name)\u201d and him looking straight at her with his hands around my neck saying \u201cI\u2019m not choking him\u201d I still remember that same night him having to come in my room to change my ice packs on my swollen face and how petrified I was that the gameboy sp I was playing was flung off the bed in a room with no carpet because I was certain I was going to get beat again. I remember going to school the next and having to tell my teachers (because all six of them forced me to stay after class and talk about it) that I was playing football with my brother and fell on a sprinkler. Funny how their response to me lying about homework was to in turn go to school and lie about why half of my face was swollen and black. I remember the first time i was ever caught shoplifting (was obviously my last time doing it too) when my dad came to pick me up, he was already so nasty to me before leaving the store that the police threatened to not let me leave because he was already trying to hit me in front of them. But you know. Now that I\u2019m an adult and have been jumped literally just because of my sexuality. If I\u2019m going to get my ass beat I\u2019m going to get my ass beat. I\u2019m just not living in fear anymore. }}}} {my thoughts on my brother} {{{{Which brings me to my brother. Who as of lately might as well be dead to me. We have not currently spoken since April, and as far as I\u2019m concerned we probably won\u2019t ever speak again. Let\u2019s start with me saying I feel like my brothers relationship with me has always been from the start. Me bailing him out when he needs it. I remember being in elementary school and him getting to go back to sleep after my mother woke us up for breakfast and would leave for work, because it was my job to \u201cwake him up after rugrats\u201d when he was about 12 or 13 he got mixed up with a bad neighborhood kid and ended up almost lighting an entire house on fire in our neighborhood. The police officers were nice enough to offer him the deal that if you stay out of trouble until you\u2019re 18 this will be completely removed off your record with no trace of it ever even happening. Sure enough he starts smoking weed in high school (which is back when it was HIGHLY frowned upon) and guess who had to take every single drug test for his four years of high school. My dumb ass. Bailing him out again. Until finally he got caught coming back late from lunch (upper class men were at the time allowed to leave campus for lunch) and he came back with a hotboxed car and didn\u2019t air it out. So when the principle stopped him to ask why he was late she was literally hit with a cloud of smoke. My brother was the sole reason my high school was no longer allowed to leave campus for lunch. My brother and father have always had an awful relationship too obviously all this places even more tension on it, and eventually lead to him either being kicked out or leaving. I don\u2019t remember which. Being on the streets on his own he was arrested more times for carrying stupid large amounts of weed on him because he sells it, and eventually got charged I think with robbery. Then to top it all off, a few years ago my brother got mixed up in the flocka epidemic. And of course there\u2019s my dumbass bailing him out again being forced to put two stolen bikes in my car and drive him to Miami. When I first started realizing how much I hated him was I think my senior year of high school. My parents had gone out of town leaving him in charge. I remember distinctly it was the night before vans warped tour he\u2019s in a huge fight with his at the time girlfriend, because he was literally hitting either her, or her and/or her kid. And I remember he stormed into my room flinging open the door trying to use me as an excuse \u201cisn\u2019t this okay because it\u2019s what dad used to do to us. \u201c of course having a criminal record he couldn\u2019t find a job and was on probation at my parents house and because nobody wanted to hire somebody with his record they literally gave him a fucking job at the company my father works for. This job is 15$ an hour, gets benefit and vacation days. I on the other hand spent years being treated like shit in jobs. Two years ago I worked for quiksilver over the course of about a year, finally left because they told me and a coworker that we were the ones being considered for management and yet they brought in two outside hires after the second one the other coworker had the sense to leave. My dumb ass stayed thinking well now that she\u2019s gone it\u2019ll look better on me. Which is when they brought in another outside hire. Who I was eventually cool with. I just stopped offering to do the management work for sales associate pay. Until I finally got so fed up that I transferred to GameStop because they were willing to start me as a keyholder since I already had basic management training. So two years trying to work for a manager only to be shit on by my parents because it\u2019s not full time and \u201cat your age your brother worked full time\u201d at my age y\u2019all gave him a fucking career because nobody wanted to hire a literal criminal. Anything I do It\u2019s just never going to be good enough. Let me talk about our most recent altercation, because it\u2019s a fantastic transition into my mother, as of last April I was unfortunately unemployed thanks to this whole virus outbreak, and of course that sets off my family members because I sleep all day while they work. So my mother asked me on April 20th the day before my birthday (a day that I was operating on approximately 2 hours of sleep because I\u2019m always up all night) if I could go help my brother in the warehouse where he works because he really needs it. I have already had altercations with my brother there from helping him a previous time. It was so bad that they sent me home early. So being there in general makes me uncomfortable. Even when I go in to help my dads department. So of course I didn\u2019t want to help which wasn\u2019t an acceptable answer to my mother and after about the 5th time of her saying something obviously I snapped and agreed to which she responded \u201cforget it\u201d and slammed my door shut. (It should be noted that in my mother\u2019s defense I\u2019m a nightmare to wake up because of how little I sleep. There are times I wake up and am in a fight with my mother because she apparently tried to wake me up and I was nasty, meanwhile I have literally no recollection of even speaking to her ) so my dumb ass trying to bite the bullet agrees to go work for eight hours in a hot sweaty warehouse with barely any ac on my birthday of all days. I woke up that morning still mad about the fight I had with my mother the day prior because I feel like as a grown ass adult I should be allowed to say no I don\u2019t want to do something. Get to the warehouse work the shift, I leave at five, which apparently was a mistake because I wasnt supposed to leave until 5:30 which I thought was fine because 1) I genuinely thought they left at 5 every day and 2) I didn\u2019t take a lunch break because I was hoping if we happened to get everything done early we would just be able to leave. Obviously that was wrong and I got a shitty passive aggressive text message from my brother. Having already been in a bad mood from my fight with my mother the day before partnered with my brother annoying me after I had left I stopped by aunts house to vent because I was literally seeing red. Wasn\u2019t even planning on going home for my birthday because I just didn\u2019t want to be around any of them. The next day comes and I don\u2019t show up because not only did I not want to be there, but when I had gotten there the day before another employee of that company said \u201cwe don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll need you tomorrow or not yet\u201d so I just didn\u2019t bother to show up because if y\u2019all needed me you should have worked that into your text message when you were being an asshole in my opinion. So of course my petty ass isn\u2019t going to show up. My brother comes home through the door doesn\u2019t even put his shit down and is in my face screaming at me for not showing up \u201cwhy should I have to explain to my boss why you didn\u2019t come\u201d \u201cwhy do you get to sleep all day while we work I\u2019m sick of it\u201d turning to my mother \u201cI\u2019m sick of him aren\u2019t y\u2019all sick of him\u201d (to which she agrees probably just trying to get him to calm down, but I won\u2019t ever for a second forget you just said you were sick of me. ) and of course I\u2019m running my mouth back in return, which is when he decided to put his hands on me, shoving me literally to the floor. And this is about where I Black out with anger because I had my Nintendo switch in my hand. The limited edition no longer in production animal crossing themed one at that. So obviously I\u2019m pissed and yank his PlayStation out of the wall and slam it on the ground. You can skip the next parentheses part if you don\u2019t care about why a stupid video game console made me so upset. (A detour to mention about these video game consoles. My brother and I used to exclusively use Xbox but I made the transition to the PS4 when it came out. My brother didn\u2019t. I had been asking for a PlayStation 4 since they came out for both my birthday and Christmas for I think like two years. Until the year my brother spent Christmas in jail because he was addicted to flocka. When my mom finally bailed him out because she felt like he was actually clean, he got a PlayStation 4. When I asked why he got one and I didn\u2019t despite it literally being the only thing I asked for as a Christmas gift, she said \u201cwell he wasn\u2019t here for Christmas so I had to make it special.\u201d I think I eventually got the PlayStation for my birthday the following year. But this fucking switch man. I swore up and down when I was a GameStop employee that they were going to make an animal crossing version and they all laughed at me said if it was going to happen it would have already and talked me into buying just a standard switch instead. Low and behold a few weeks later the animal crossing one is announced and I\u2019m lowkey heartbroken that I just spent a majority of my money on the standard one. I eventually get myself so worked up over it that I asked my mom to front me the money to buy the new system, and I will give her 200 when I sell my switch and the rest from my next paycheck. She\u2019s talking some I can\u2019t I don\u2019t have that kind of money, which would have been totally fine. I was just embarrassed that I not only put my pride away to ask for money, but was also upset enough about not getting the animal crossing one to even be in this situation. So whatever whatever we end up agreeing on if I sell the console first and give her the two hundred she will give me the rest. Where as I was only asking her for the front because I didn\u2019t want to risk selling my console before the new one came out and risk then not having a console at all. Especially since I had already missed like two years of the switches lifespan. So obviously I\u2019m super thankful to my mom and I literally spent like two days thanking her and talking to her about it, only for me to find out that she had given me my own money. I don\u2019t know what it was for, possibly my unemployment since the console came out around the time the virus was starting to flare. And at that point all I can keep thinking is wow. You really kept my own money from me, made me gamble on being able to find a limited edition console without a preorder. And told me you couldn\u2019t loan me anything. That makes me so mad. How are you going to lie about my own damn money. Serves me right I guess for not being adult enough to stop using our joint bank account.) Anyway. I slam his PlayStation on the ground after he put his hand on me the first time we get into a screaming match in his room to which I say something along the lines of \u201cyou\u2019re allowed to knock my switch out of my hand so why should you expect any different of your PlayStation\u201d to which he responds (talking out of his ass) \u201cwell you didn\u2019t pay for it mom did!\u201d Jokes on you asshole not only did I pay for it entirely with my money but our mother literally withheld my own money from me and made it more difficult for me to get an already difficult to get console. This ends up with him coming back into my room because everyone in my family (myself included) has to have the last word in argument. Which leads to him putting his hands on me a second time except this time since there\u2019s not a 400$ gaming system in my hand I pull his disgusting ass down with me.}}}}} This whole fight somehow ends with me being kicked out of my house by my mother. {my thoughts on my mother} {{{{Fun fact. Maybe about a week before this my mother was begging me to stop going out despite taking precautions with a mask and specially made sanitizer consisting of primarily alcohol. Because they had a friend in critical condition from covid. This is the same woman who threw her kid out into streets during the first peak of this epidemic. (I\u2019m in Florida so it is at this moment higher than that first peak because Floridians are trash) so I spend the next three or four day sleeping in my car doing whatever trying to manage on my own, spending what little money I had fixing the joycon drift on my switch that was non existent until my brother attacked me with it in my hand. One thing leads to another and I eventually end up back home. I asked my mom if we could start family therapy because I\u2019m literally holding onto grudges that I don\u2019t know how to let go of. She says when all of this is over but I\u2019m positive she\u2019s forgotten about it and it might very well be what causes me to cut her out all together. A few days ago me and my mother got into a huge arguement because she woke me up to ask me to take her to firestone to pick up her car(I\u2019m exhausted but totally not a problem to me at all) so I get right up get dressed grab my keys and when I walk out of my room she goes \u201care you ready now I\u2019m not in a rush or anything\u201d I was a little annoyed by the stupid question I\u2019ll admit, like you just two minutes ago came into my room to wake me up and ask me to take you. Yes I\u2019m ready to go lol. Otherwise I\u2019d still be asleep. She of course takes my flat response (a slight mixture of both my annoyance and exhaustion) as me being in a bad mood. So we get into my car and she\u2019s overreacting because my car is a little shaky (which I\u2019m almost positive is just because I need air in my tires) talking some oh my god we have to pull over what if you have a flat. Like we definitely would know if we were driving on a flat tire. It\u2019s been doing this since like the second week I got this car. So I\u2019m just sitting there trying to get to the destination as fast as possible trying to hold my tongue and not cause a fight when she sets me off and says something along the lines of \u201cyou\u2019re in a bad mood because I asked you to take me\u201d my response being \u201coh what I\u2019m in a bad mood because I got right up to do something you asked me to do???\u201d which fucking infuriated me and caused a screaming match in my car. I don\u2019t understand why she has this god complex where she thinks she gets to tell other people how they feel about something. She did it to me on my birthday too which I forgot to mention and am now too lazy to go back and add in. But like it drives me crazy. I don\u2019t care if they\u2019re right wrong or somewhere in between. Nobody has the right to decide how somebody feels about something except for that person. So when I sit there and tell you I\u2019m not mad and you tell me \u201cyes you are mad that\u2019s why you\u2019re being shitty\u201d that\u2019s a self fulfilling prophecy right there. Of course that shits going to make me mad. If you\u2019re just going to decide I\u2019m in a bad mood for me then shit I guess I\u2019m in a bad fucking mood then. So this screaming match in my car leads to her saying \u201cI hope something happens to your car, and when it does DONT call me\u201d. I will never ever in a million years forget she said that to me. I hope that when something does happen to my car, I\u2019m inside of it, I hope it\u2019s something fatal, and I hope she has to live with it for the rest of her life. And then of course after our screaming match she sends me a passive aggressive text message (because apparently my family is famous for doing that shit) talking some I won\u2019t be screamed at in a car that I bought you, you are SO disrespectful the next time you talk to me like that you can find a new place to live! (As if she didn\u2019t kick me out when I was 16, and 18, and 23. Like clearly I can manage in my car bitch try me. I would rather starve to death on the streets than feel like I need help from someone who treats me like shit) Skip the parentheses if you don\u2019t care about context with my car history (Both me and my brother were fortunate enough to get cars for our 16th birthday. The difference between us is my brother has wrecked I think 2 cars my parents bought him, one car they gave him because my mom got a new car (which that one he wasn\u2019t at fault for but still it\u2019s a car to add to your tally) and ruined one of my dads trucks that he was using for whatever reason one day. I on the other hand drove the same car that I had since I was 16 until literally this year when I turned 25 and was given a new one. But honestly my parents had been trying to buy me another one for a few years I just fought them on it because I didn\u2019t want a new car which I will explain why later. ) And then now just today, we are in another arguement because I think last night, my brother walked out our back gate to go sell drugs in our mailbox because he thinks he\u2019s cool and tough and can handle jail as if he isn\u2019t literally crying \u201cmommy bail me out\u201d when he\u2019s in there. As he\u2019s going out he knocks over the ashtray I had been using over there (which was admittedly in the walkway but only because that particular night I was in a hurry to relocate under my backyard awning because it was raining and I had all my technology on me) but when he walks back he has the nerve to say to me \u201cyour ashtray is knocked over \u201c as if i wasn\u2019t outside and heard him kick it over like I\u2019m supposed to lean up after him. Despite us having literally not a said a word to eachother since April. So I hid the ashtray that he normally uses with the mindset of \u201cif he needs an ashtray he\u2019ll have to go over and clean up the one he kicked over.\u201d Only for me to find that my mother ended up being the one to clean up his mess. Which of course infuriated me. And then she had the nerve to defend him in a text message after we got into an arguement about it. \u201cWell it is your ashtray...\u201d okay did I kick over my ashtray or did my brother. Because that\u2019s the person who should have cleaned it up was who knocked it over. In regards to my mother specifically it hurts me the most. Because I often at times feels like she\u2019s the only one out of the 3 of my immediately family that I could have a relationship with or that I actively want to have a relationship with and that bridge is so close to being burnt to a crips. I don\u2019t want to appear ungrateful because as a mother she does go above and beyond. I\u2019ve been spoiled sure. But my problem with it is, I feel like my mother only gives as much as she gives so that she has ammunition to hold over peoples head. I fought her for YEARS about getting a new because I knew she would just hold it over my head. Which obviously I was right about. I remember being kicked out when I was 18 because I wasn\u2019t working and i had just gotten kicked out of college and she said leave your keys pack your stuff and find somewhere to live. So I did set off with no car no money no nothing ended up being taken in by my best friends family. Spent a year or two there, and I literally did not get my car back (the same one she had given me at 16) until the girl I was living with literally called her in tears asking if we could just borrow it so we could go see her mother who was in the hospital because she needed brain surgery. LITERAL BRAIN SURGERY was the only reason I got my car back. And it still took my friend like two or three times of asking my mother for her to let me use my car just to take her to see her mother. My father has always babied me and let me get away with more than he lets my brother get away with I can admit that. The problem with it is, that because I don\u2019t feel the same type of yearning for a relationship about my father that I do about my mother I don\u2019t really care about him favoring me. And because my dad tends to let me get away with more my mom feels like she has to let my brother get away with more, which in turn causes me to always just feel like I\u2019m chasing my mother\u2019s approval or some shit. }}}} {thoughts on my own disgusting self} It\u2019s only been recently that I\u2019m starting to come around to my father and that\u2019s only because I think I\u2019m starting to hate my mother. I know I probably sound ungrateful and entitled. And I can see why. But I am truly thankful for how privilege I\u2019ve been and all that I\u2019ve been given. But I don\u2019t know how to not feel the way that I feel about these things. And that\u2019s not to say I\u2019m perfect either. I\u2019ve caused plenty of problem for my family. So let me just skip to all my flaws now. When I was a kid like before I could even start kindergarten I was literally already sucking dick. My next door neighbor ( my brothers age at the time) used to make me do it to him and I used to agree because he was considerably nicer to me when I do would so. He was already a problem child too but that\u2019s neither here nor there. I was pretty much only sucking him off because my brother always hated when I would hang out with him and his friends, and the neighbor always let me hang around (for obvious reasons) distinctly remember my brother catching us a few times but I guess nothing was ever done about it. Not even sure if my parents know about it. But as an adult I can see that\u2019s where I started getting fucked up. Idk if I necessarily blame my neighbor for me being gay, because I do firmly as a gay man believe that it\u2019s just who you are and can\u2019t be changed, but I feel like there will literally always be a part of me that questions it. Like what if I wasn\u2019t sucking dick at five years old, would I be interested in girls? I remember having a crush on at least two different girls before i met (what I now as an adult realize was probably my first boy crush) like looking back on my child hood I vividly remember playing \u201cdoctor\u201d with other kids or truth or dare that always ended sexual and I realize like damn. That\u2019s fucking gross we were all kids. Fast forward to me being in I think middle school, and I was caught sexually experimenting with my cousin. I was definitely old enough to know better so I take fault there, but I also wasn\u2019t ever the one initiating it. You know. I was letting him suck me off for longer than I can remember honestly, but I also distinctly remember I wasn\u2019t the one initiating it. I still remember the first night at his house when he asked me to go pornhub and grilling him about how he even knows about that. I don\u2019t remember when I started letting him do stuff to me, but I know that I shouldn\u2019t have. I remember well enough that when he would come sleepover there were times I would opt to stay up late with my father in hopes that he would fall asleep waiting for me to come in. I remember one time I was up late and he comes walking out like 2 hours after being put to bed because he was trying to get me to come in to bed with him. But again I was the older kid in that situation. So that\u2019s my fuck up. Obviously when we got caught it put a wedge between that side of our family. I can see why, but in hindsight I always wonder. Would you have still distanced yourself if you knew it was your son who had been initiating it? Because he was younger all the blame was pushed onto me. And I can see why. Again I should have known better. That\u2019s probably around the time I started getting fat. By high school at one point I was over 300 pounds and openly gay. Never had a serious relationship. Never even had someone interested in a relationship with me. I can see why. Not only was I cringey in high school but I was literally disgusting. It wasn\u2019t till about my senior year I finally got back under 300 pounds and started losing some weight and gaining some confidence. But here\u2019s the kicker. Before I started losing the weight I had become a literal serial catfisher. And I\u2019m talking like anybody you wanted to see naked I would go out of my way to target. Friends, friends boyfriends. Nobody was off limits to me. It makes me sick thinking about the hundreds of people I\u2019ve catfished because I was horny and lonely. Catfishing even basically got me kicked out of my college ( granted I was surprisingly innocent at that time but because the kid found out about me being a catfish he refused to believe it wasn\u2019t me, despite me literally having to show my catfish accounts to the dean and them not matching up to whoever he was talking to. The college only realized their mistake a semester or two later because the kid was immediately put on academic probation the semester following my suspension, and then got caught trying to do the same thing to another gay student the semester after that. Which is when they were like wow we were wrong we\u2019re so sorry don\u2019t even worry about the requirements we gave you for coming back you can just come back never did though.) It wasn\u2019t only until I hit maybe 22 or 23 that it like clicked with how awful what I was doing was. And started making an active effort to stop it. And I feel like I was only even willing to because I fell in genuine love with somebody I was catfishing. When I finally told him, we were fine for a few days. He told me he didn\u2019t care that I was a guy because he fell in love with the person behind a screen. But all of that quickly crumbled to ashes. That\u2019s another one that\u2019s my own fault. Not only was I doing something shitty but I was also in too deep. I think I still to this day get texted from somebody I started catfishing when I was about 15 or 16 that I just am too afraid to finally tell the truth to. But since the recent heart break I\u2019ve thankfully been able to almost entirely remove catfishing from life save for the one guy I was in too deep with, and the old catfish accounts that I occasionally log into when I\u2019m desperately alone/horny/whatever it may be. I\u2019m tired of feeling alone. I just want to be loved. I want someone to want me. To care about me. I\u2019m starting to realize this world is awful. Almost every thing and everyone in it is bleak. Some people genuinely want to live long happy lives, me personally, I don\u2019t think I can make it doing this shit for another 25 years. Self deprecating jokes and suicidal humor are my biggest weapons. Because I feel like if I don\u2019t turn them into jokes. I\u2019ll let them overcome me. Too many people in this world are awful. I don\u2019t want to be one anymore. I doubt any of you will actually care enough to read this through. But if you for some unknown reason did, then I thank you. Because I could really use a friend. TLDR; I\u2019m a scumbag. I\u2019m starting to think my family is scumbags, and I\u2019m genuinely losing my will to live. I\u2019ve been holding on to grudges that are literally consuming me and transforming me into a being of hatred and it makes me sick to my stomach.

The closest place with lots of people is about an hour away, but I have some driving anxiety going on in the bigger city.

Thanks for any input!", "1jhwepw": "Surviving is a struggle and I hate people If there\u2019s one thing life has humbled me with time and again, it\u2019s how difficult it is to survive as a person from a broken home who\u2019s trying to find love / hope. And it\u2019s not because you\u2019re particularly unlucky, but because you simply don\u2019t believe you can win. Life has never given it you in a platter and you grow up seeing how scarce your life is even in terms of resources that aren\u2019t even that hard to find or be provided with. My parents have had an unhappy marriage their entire life, one where you can visibly see how tired they are of each other and are only continuing because they decided to have \u201ckids\u201d. You learn to perceive yourself as a liability in such homes before you could even learn what it means. I was the older kid in that household which means my parents definitely did a better job with my younger sibling than they did with me. Being born felt like the wrong thing to do and growing up felt like a struggle. I could never trust people by sharing what happens at home because my parents had an \u201cimage\u201d to maintain. I\u2019m not sure how much truth am I revealing even now but I\u2019m trying. And it\u2019s less for the viewers and more for my own satisfaction that I didn\u2019t keep all of this to myself. That someone knows. That someone somewhere might be going through something similar and maybe this post tells them life is hard and it would continue to be hard but you\u2019ve got you and that\u2019s all that matters on most days. My life has particularly been hard across aspects (family, studies, love, job). When u started venturing out of my home I was 17, I chose the college farthest from home because that was the only way of getting away from the toxicity which focusing on what could be relied on in the future \u2014 my education. I got bullied a month into college for being different. I was an introvert, always into myself, didn\u2019t talk much and often appeared distressed due to the environment of constant fights I had come from. I had my hostel roommates boycott me and call me names. I had a senior in college who liked me, lack of people in my life u needed to survive lead me to agree to a relationship with him. He was five years older to me and that should tell you a lot about how dominated I was in that relationship. He asked for my Facebook password, changed my relationship status, mentioned his name on my profile, and unfriended all the guys on my profile. And I was so weak, that I couldn\u2019t even confront him about this. I knew he won\u2019t listen and might retaliate. So I did what most girls would \u2014 forgot about it. A year passed by and I was banned from talking to any guy in college. If I did, it was met with allegations and blames of me trying to get attention. I survived that relationship with zero friends. Again a toxic ground that I couldnt talk to people about. Six months later, I heard from a friend that he was found kissing some girl at a party last night (a party he advised me to not come to). Obviously that friend told others about it too (gossip travels fast in college) and people started coming to me to tell me about more incidents like these where he did things with other girls over the past two years. I was distraught, once again had no one to go to, and couldn\u2019t see what tomorrow would look like. Thankfully I had some friends who had gotten better friends over the course of the college who supported me through it and who I\u2019m indebted to for life. My boyfriend kept on denying these allegations until he finally accepted them a year down the line. He pursued me and the relationship further for two more years until he finally gave up. I think something inside me that was carrying hope also broke with that relationship and it has only been breaking more the more encounters I have with guys and people. I think the society demands you to wear a certain face to participate in it and be deemed as \u201cyou belong\u201d. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s my inability to wear that face or disapproval to the concept, I feel like I dont fit in. And that takes the joy out of living? Not fitting in? Animals bring me more joy than humans do. I at my core, detest humans and I\u2019m not sure if this could be a successful way to go about life. Id be a miserable human and hence a more toxic one if this school of thought isn\u2019t challenged. This does give me anxiety, like it\u2019s being in a group you know you secretly hate. Navigating in a world you know no one would ever understand you in. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s my series of experiences or conditioning that makes me the way I am.

Currently, i work from home, but the job doesn't pay as much as it should. And the growth options are limited because i live in a city with limited employment opportunities (at least in the field that i am working in currently), and i can't move to another city. I am at a stage in life where i need financial stability. There is a job opportunity that may give me financial stability to some extent. There are other pros also. For example, i have worked at that organization previously and know many people there. Those people are all friendly and helpful, and that organization was very good to me. So, the problem is: that job is a teaching job. And teaching has felt very alien to me. Idk why. I used to feel like i have been placed in an alien land when i was put in the middle of kids. I did my job decently at that time, but i don't think i have the empathy or extrovertedness required for teaching. Additionally, this position is a higher position than the position i worked at previously, so the responsibilities would be much higher. I don't know whether i should apply for this opportunity. I feel extremely anxious about the changes in my life that will happen if i get the job. I am also worried whether i will be able to do the job well enough and whether i will be happy. On the flipside, i know that if i get this job, i will have financial stability and many of my problems would improve. Lately, i have been feeling like i am failing the people around me. They think that i can do so much, but i don't feel like doing anything other than wake up, do my current job, eat, meet friends sometimes, and go to sleep. This lack of ambition is killing me. I see people around me chasing money left, right, and centre. I want to do that too but i don't do anything for it. People tell me that i am stuck in my comfort zone and that i need to get out of it to do better things. Deep down, i think they are right. For a long time, i didn't feel the need to change anything in my life. But lately, i am feeling like i must bring a change, at least career wise.

Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you for taking the time to read this long post.", "1jhrb1r": "AITA for Feeling Drained by My Best Friend's Negativity and Self-Inflicted Problems? Hello everyone, for starters, I\u2019m 23F, and my best friend is also 24F. We\u2019ve been best friends since early elementary school, and I\u2019m almost done with college now. I really feel bad for thinking and feeling this way because my best friend has always been good to me and my family. She\u2019s always been there for me, going above and beyond, and spoiling me, really. She\u2019s gotten us many gifts on all special occasions like birthdays and Christmas and is close with my family. The issue is that my best friend can be a very negative person, and I\u2019m the type of person whose mood is affected by the people around me. I grew up as the eldest child in a family whose parents hate each other but stay together \u201cfor the kids,\u201d so I always felt like I had to fix everyone\u2019s problems and moods. This led to me developing really bad anxiety and a people-pleasing personality. Surprisingly, I think that\u2019s why I got along so well with my best friend since she didn\u2019t have a good family growing up either. She\u2019s been through so much\u2014one of her parents isn\u2019t in her life, and she\u2019s been through toxic relationships, etc. We practically text every day, but lately, over the last couple of weeks, I\u2019ve felt like she hasn\u2019t wanted to talk to me or just gets annoyed with anything I have to say or tell her. She doesn\u2019t like when I \u201coffer solutions\u201d to her problems or try to help her out of a negative mindset or even with financial decisions. She constantly makes bad decisions for herself, like dating people who aren\u2019t good for her, going into debt, wrecking multiple cars, and spending all her money on fast food and shopping. Then she complains about how everything is expensive and how she doesn\u2019t have money, blaming it on her job. While they don\u2019t pay her much, she doesn\u2019t even try budgeting, and whenever me or her grandparents tell her this, she gets annoyed and says she can\u2019t because it\u2019s little money. At this point, I\u2019m really tired of her complaining, especially since most of her problems are self-inflicted. Yet, she continues to complain about how the universe hates her. I really can\u2019t stand it anymore; I can\u2019t have a conversation with her without her turning it into something negative. She also has terrible insecurity issues. I feel bad because she\u2019s been going through a lot of health issues and is worried about that, but over the years, she\u2019s been in and out of hospitals because of her anxiety. No matter who she sees, they tell her she\u2019s fine and that her anxiety is making her believe she\u2019s having a heart attack or stroke or that something\u2019s wrong with her heart, seizures, etc. Whenever I tell her she\u2019s a hypochondriac, she gets pissed and complains that no one understands her. I really try; I really do, but she\u2019s very stubborn, and honestly, it feels like she\u2019s the one who won\u2019t listen to anyone else around her. We\u2019ve also had conversations about relationships before, and she will continuously tell me that my idea of love is unrealistic because I want someone who\u2019s loyal and who doesn\u2019t participate in hookup culture, someone who thinks of those things as something special, who can hold a conversation and be open and vulnerable with you\u2014not someone closed off who can\u2019t communicate, etc. She thinks that because I read so many romance books, my idea of love is fantasy and that real people aren\u2019t like that. She also criticizes my ex for how he treated me (and he wasn\u2019t a peach\u2014he ghosted me a lot and made me feel crappy), but when I point out that her boyfriend and exes are worse, she gets upset with me. I just don\u2019t like feeling like she thinks I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about, or that she\u2019s smarter than me or knows more and invalidates anything I say to her.

I don\u2019t have any desire to manipulate others or take advantage of them I believe it\u2019s morally wrong and I can and have felt guilt over past things I have done when I hurt people.

I have an easier time expressing sympathy or letting them know I hope things turn around for them soon.Or perhaps help others with thing when they need help like giving rides to coworkers and such.

Hi, I'm 25M, and lately, I feel like I'm starting to hate everyone. I had a close friend from college who helped me get into his company, and I was grateful for that. But as time passed, I started getting better opportunities\u2014higher salary, chances to work in other states, and overall career growth. I used to share my work experiences and achievements with him, thinking he\u2019d be happy for me, but he would instantly cut my calls whenever I spoke about work. Later, through a mutual friend, I found out that he had been badmouthing me. Once, I told my friends about partying and dancing with girls at a pub, and he went and told them about how I got rejected in college and became afraid to talk to girls after that. Yes, it happened, but why bring it up just to embarrass me? He also had a crush on a girl, but he would constantly criticize her dressing, how she posts pictures, and even trash-talked her and her ex to me. He said he\u2019d never love her, but suddenly, he committed to her and hid it from me. When he finally told me, he acted like nothing had happened. To make things worse, he\u2019d mock me in front of others, saying I never dressed well before getting my job, and even told a senior that I wouldn\u2019t be a software engineer without his help. I\u2019ve decided to cut him off, but I can\u2019t forget the past insults. I stopped talking to him for 2 years, But he's still in my instagram followers list and couldn't block him because he will reach out to me asking why or through mutual friends and it would really embarass me. what to do ?

They played for a junior college and spent a lot of time training and being great but not NFL material. We thought it would stop after college but he only became more dedicated and all this talk about scouting and how he\u2019d been contacted for deals sounded like bragging or lying to ppl who knew him. It didn\u2019t help that it was all he could talk about or bring up, so everyone got annoyed and thought he was just trying to lie. Im not saying this to be a jerk or ruin his dream but he\u2019s over 30 now and somebody as football obsessed should know that it doesnt really happen at this point. The main point that\u2019s freaking me out is he posted these things of like an \u201cunknown number\u201d missed call and he\u2019s convinced it was a scouter and he needs to figure out who to get his chance back. To me this is the point where something is seriously wrong if something as simple as a missed spam call registers as a career in the NFL. He has been posting basically essays nonstop for days defending why this is legit and how upset he is and i cant twll if his mother thinks this is true or if she\u2019s just trying to comfort him. Like i said this has been going on for years but it\u2019s never escalated to this level of him being upset and it scares me that this all started from a simple spam call.

Was there a point when you knew, that life is worth living it? What makes a life worth living? I know... that's a big and very loaded question. From the outside, my life would surely be described as worth living. I'm 34, mother of 3 wonderful kids, since last summer separated from my still-husband but we still get along very well. I have a job, a home, no financial struggles. My parents help with the kids and more and are very understanding. Still, I hate my life. Not the people in it. They are all great! I love my kids very much! Life is just so very exhausting. Of course, there are good moments, there always will be. Still, I just don't understand why people like living. I hate it. And I hate the thought, that I still have to exist 40 to 60 more years. I have weekly sessions with a great psychologist and meds that help. I have a severe depression and since december an autism diagnosis. That explains, why I never felt like I belonged. I really am trying to get my life sorted out. To adjust it to my needs, since I ignored them for 34 years. But that's a slow process. You can't change your neurotypical life in a few weeks into an autism friendly one. And I really don't know if I'll ever like living. If it ever will be less exhausting. I really don't want to live anymore. But I can't quit, so I won't. Because I have kids, and they don't deserve a dead mother. I don't know what I want to get out of this post. Nothing I guess. I just needed to get it out. Tomorrow I go to my job like every day, smile at the people around me like every day, cry in the evening like every day.", "1jflc5c": "7 years of isolation amde me hate humans I wrote this in Arabic first, but here is the English translation: From the age of 18 to 25, the number of friends I spent my youth with and shared the most important moments of my life with is literally the most depressing number in existence: zero. Since I graduated high school, every attempt to experience any form of human connection has only resulted in failure, embarrassment, and shame. I wouldn\u2019t even mind if my relationship with someone was full of drama and problems\u2014I just want to feel like I still exist. These past seven years have not been easy. At first, I felt a bit of hope, but it quickly turned into panic, fear, and constant rejection from people. I ended up completely alone with my thoughts. When intrusive thoughts hit me, making me feel like something bad is about to happen\u2014like a heaviness in my hands that makes me unable to lift them, weakness in my legs, or my heart beating too fast\u2014I start thinking these are all symptoms of a heart attack. Literally, everything in me and everything I see around me becomes a reminder that I\u2019m about to die, and there\u2019s nothing or no one to take that fear away from me. And it\u2019s not just about death. It\u2019s also about losing my sight, my hearing, spinal injuries, and so much more. Every single thought that enters my mind forces itself into my reality, and with no one around, there\u2019s no one to reassure me that I\u2019m just imagining things. These fears inevitably forced me to find a way to cope and reduce their intensity. And what was the only way I found to lessen these obsessive thoughts and fears for seven years\u2014and still rely on today? The only thing that relieved me, even a little, was putting on my headphones, playing music, pacing back and forth in my room, and imagining people talking to me. I would physically react, talk to myself, laugh, feel sad, get angry, cry, and experience every emotion I\u2019ve been deprived of. Most of the time, these imaginary conversations weren\u2019t even related to my intrusive thoughts at all. Just imagining another person engaging with me\u2014even about random topics\u2014somehow made me feel a little comforted. I feel like I\u2019m missing any presence of another being in my life. What hurts me even more is that one time, I was walking on the sidewalk, and two people were walking toward me, shoulder to shoulder. One of them needed to step back so we could all pass without bumping into each other. But to my surprise, neither of them moved aside, and my shoulder collided hard with one of theirs. The strange thing is, I didn\u2019t get angry or upset at all. On the contrary, my first thought was that I hadn\u2019t felt another human being in so long. Any touch, even a random bump or an accidental hit\u2014I don\u2019t mind. Just anything that reminds me that I still exist in this world. The feeling that no one knows me isn\u2019t just about \"no one knows me.\" It feels like I\u2019ve been exiled from existence itself. Why haven\u2019t I been able to form any real human connection to this day? Why have I been deprived of something that shouldn\u2019t be this hard at all? Other people also want to connect with others, but they don\u2019t want me. No one I\u2019ve ever met has been as isolated and alone as I am. Everyone has at least one friend, even if their friend is annoying, stupid, or insufferable. But me\u2014specifically me\u2014no one wants. I am the outcast, the unwanted one, the one with a personality that even I hate, and everyone else hates, too. Every time I tried to make an effort to form friendships, my weirdness and terrible social skills would show in the most embarrassing way possible. From kindergarten to the end of middle school, I spent most of my time alone, and my friends were extremely limited. I feel like this affected my basic social skills when trying to meet new people. I didn\u2019t know how to introduce myself properly or pick up on the social cues people use. I was literally dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb. No one would ever be proud to walk next to someone like that. So, of course, I remained alone. But in high school, somehow, by pure coincidence, my social life suddenly flourished because of a few lucky events. I don\u2019t even know how it happened. I felt popular, I enjoyed school, and my personality improved in a way that made me unable to imagine my life without my friends. But then we graduated. And now, here I am\u201425 years old, feeling like my personality is stuck at 18 or 19. I haven\u2019t achieved anything, I don\u2019t know anyone, and I haven\u2019t moved forward from my room. Every time I look into people\u2019s eyes in the street, it feels like my shame takes the form of a giant being in the sky, crushing what little self-worth I have left. I feel my inferiority, my delay, my weakness. I feel envious of everyone. My future is over. I won\u2019t say I want to kill myself or anything like that, because I\u2019m not stupid. I know full well that if I did, the only reaction people would have would be mockery, ridicule, and laughter at me and everything I\u2019ve felt\u2014all the emotions that no one knows about. I don\u2019t blame them. I mean, what else would you expect from a weirdo who lived seven years unnoticed? Did you really think there would be any other reaction? Huh, you idiot? That\u2019s why I would never harm myself through suicide. Because that would only prove everyone right\u2014that my existence is as good as nonexistent. Honestly, even calling myself \"human\" is a compliment, because I\u2019m less than that. No one has ever acknowledged my existence, as if I was meant to be erased from the world, as if I never felt any of the emotions they feel. But my will is strong. And I\u2019m not saying I\u2019ll become a criminal or physically attack people\u2014no, never. That\u2019s not who I am. But I swear, all the pain and isolation I\u2019ve felt will have an impact. The suffering that has destroyed my body and drained me\u2014I will return it to the world. My pain has meaning. My emotions have value. No matter how much I want to reconnect with people, I can\u2019t force myself to forget these past seven years. I just wanted someone to look at me like a normal person. Forget being a friend\u2014just a normal human being. And then maybe, maybe we could become friends. But everyone sees me as weird. I swear, I hate all of you. I swear to God, I hope you all suffer and feel pain, and I won\u2019t allow myself to feel any sympathy. Because sympathy is mutual, and if no one feels for me, I swear I won\u2019t feel for them either. If I\u2019m not human like you, then you\u2019re not human to me either. This time has been enough to prove to me that I have no value in this world. My life has been at a standstill, and it still is. My existence is as good as nothing. But I will make sure my feelings don\u2019t just disappear like they never existed. With whatever remains of my life, I will make sure I prove my existence to everyone, and I will take my revenge.", "1jfjjga": "I feel sick Recently I have felt a lot of guilt and fear I hurt people when I was in freshman year of high school I\u2019m 15 and a sophomore now and like it makes me sick because I was so overly sexual to people who trusted me to be their friend and I made them uncomfy i woukd text them making sexual jokes and just being sexual even when they said no. None of them talk to me anymore and I don\u2019t think they forgave me and I feel so sick I hurt them like that and I did the same thing to a 17 yr old who is now 18 I begged to them for explicit pictures and making advances on text things like that and they said no and I kept doing it and one time they said I s@d them but I never met them in person before but I felt sick so I kept apologizing but they got annoyed and told me that they manipulated me to keep making THISE mistakes and begging for picture and that they were paid to but idk if that is true. But now I\u2019m at school and I\u2019m scared one of the people I hurt woukd report me or tell the whole school and I deserve it but I\u2019m scared of being outlasted thought of as a sick monster and maybe I deserve it but I\u2019m scared I\u2019m scared what my new friends woukd think of me how they would never want to talk to me again how my teachers would hate me. It scares me I have nightmares and maybe that\u2019s a sign I deserve to be outcasted but idk what to do maybe I need advice idk.

For context, I\u2019ve always struggled with suicidal thoughts and thoughts about wanting to die since I was about 8. I grew up in an abusive household within a narcissist family unit. I still live with them unfortunately and have struggled since I was 15 to leave my home. For the longest time, my parents didn\u2019t allow me to have a job, a bank account, nor did they teach me how to drive. I wasn\u2019t every allow to go out or even so much as to go over to a friends house. I first attempted when I was around 16 and within one month I was hospitalized 3 different times. I basically spent Christmas in a mental health facility. My mom attempted to legally disabled me, never understood why. My family always complained about me not being able to do anything for myself because I was never taught to do anything by my family so it\u2019s ironic to me that they tried to disable because wouldn\u2019t that mean you\u2019re the ones stuck taking care (or lack there of) of me? Anyway, I reached these basic milestones of getting a job and car through trail and error on my own. Even then, my biggest challenge has been moving out and cutting off my family. I live in Florida so rent is absurdly expensive and I definitely want to move out of the state and then I remember that I have to essentially buy my own freedom. I recently lost my job and have been nonstop applying trying to find even a shitty job just to have consistent income and not have to do ubereats all week. I\u2019m in therapy and every morning I start off with practicing gratitude and positive affirmations. Lately, it\u2019s been incredibly difficult and yesterday morning my suicidal thoughts came in hot. They have been in and out of my mind but with emotional regulation I was able to manage them, now\u2026 not so much. I cried all day yesterday and thought it was just a bad day and if I went to bed earlier, I could have a new day and feel differently. I was wrong. I keep trying to do my best to regulate myself and remind myself of a job interview coming up. My biggest question that has yet to be unanswered, does it actually get better? I tell myself and my therapist this can\u2019t be it and there has to be more than just living in a meaningless marathon of misery. Of course, I know we all have bad day, weeks, months, years. Suffering in our life time is inevitable but I do wonder if this feeling of being unhappy and wanting to die will ever go away? If I can emotionally regulate my suicidal thoughts away and never feel like I want to hurt myself again or will I unfortunately be someone like one of my personal heroes, Robin Williams? Waking up one day in my 40s/50s, still unhappy and just end it all? I don\u2019t really have a support system. I refer to my family as the \u201cworking class Roy\u2019s\u201d from Succession with all the narcissism and betrayal. The most I have told my few friend is that I lost my job and they haven\u2019t really reached out to me and when I hang out with them, I don\u2019t feel like they enjoy my company anymore. Other than my therapist and even then, her advice on \u201cfocus on what you can control\u201d or \u201chave you tried self-care?\u201d Just feels insulting at this point. And let me clear it up, yes I am still doing my health coping mechanisms of reframing my thoughts, practicing gratitude and self care, daily exercise and socializing when I get the chance and above all else, believing it will help and this will pass. But the wanting to not be alive, even when I tell myself life IS worth living and trying to force myself to believe it when my material conditions don\u2019t mirror that and I\u2019ve been stuck in the same environment for almost 30 years, will that really pass or am I just gaslighting myself?", "1jeomh5": "Am I a sucker for letting my past affect me?

But, and I mean this genuinely and appreciatively, it was inadvertently a huge factor in helping me understand that not only am I NOT an actual fucking HUMAN being like EVERY SINGLE OTHER PERSON \u201cMY AGE\u201d AND ESPECIALLY IN COLLEGE (even if I\u2019m still not back there), but that at this point there is absolutely no chance of me becoming one at this point in my life \u201c\u201d\u201d\u201dlife\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d, in terms of undoing past damage. So even if for whatever bizarre reason you thought that a thing like \u201cme\u201d was somehow entitled to an apology (I\u2019m not) as opposed to anything other than expressions of disgust on yours or anyone\u2019s part, the prior mess was still actually productive for me. I remember you telling me in your last message that you understood the way I felt, and had once been in a similar position yourself. I\u2019m not sure if you meant just in terms of harming my\u201dself\u201d, or more broadly the experience of spending part of one\u2019s life not growing up like a normal human being and than being lost when in the world, but I feel like you meant the latter. And that was one of the most important things. In conjunction with what you told me about your own history with harm, I saw that even if you at one time had lived a life where you were not human, you must have turned everything around WHILE THAT WINDOW WAS STILL OPEN, and still were a person by the time you STARTED COLLEGE at least. So, thank you for once again inadvertently helping me let go of another delusion about \u201cme\u201d changing. I now recognize that at this point in my \u201c\u201dlife\u201d\u201d, I\u2019m too much of a mentally ill, sheltered freak to ever become a human as well, and that there\u2019s no time, or point, anymore. Sadly after some previous nights spent staring down bottles of pills I ultimately still seem to lack the courage to fucking kill myself like I need to (even though logically I understand that\u2019s what I should do, I doubt I ever will, especially since I put all of that effort into my appearance, which working on makes me feel better than anything else in the world) but I\u2019m really appreciative that this situation helped me realize just how fucking WEAK and EMPTY and HELPLESS I am. And more than ANYTHING how HOLLOW I am, completely devoid of normal HUMAN MEMORIES of having fun and also suffering and discovering one\u2019s self and growing with other HUMANS. What\u2019s even more sad is that several days ago I was forced to be on a mood stabilizer. So as that kicks it will probably steal the depth and intensity of my emotions of which I am so proud, probably the only thing I can say that about. Already it\u2019s more difficult to imagine myself being really moved by, say, a piece of music, or having these beautiful sobbing fits at night thinking about all that was stolen from me. And even if this med don\u2019t make me feel outright horrendous like my previous concoction of 3 pills I was on until somewhat over a year prior, I predict that such \u201cstability\u201d will cause me to maybe believe these false delusional ideas about \u201cchanging\u201d, or even worse make me okay with not being human. Obviously I understand fully that this is wrong and inappropriate to send. In fact I understood that about the email I sent in early September, too. When I sent an apology the next night, I claimed that I was hanging on to a false hope about friendship, because that was easier to explain then the fact that I knew it was wrong but lacked sufficient mental stability and self control to not compulsively broadcast my suffering. That I\u2019m doing that again just PROVES how FUCKING CRAZY and UNWORTHY of INTERACTING WITH HUMANS \u201cI\u201d am. And more than anything I\u2019m just so tired of being me that I can\u2019t even think of what\u2019s wrong anymore. Plus my true feelings need to go out NOW before the meds kick in and I begin to believe aforementioned false things anyway. Again: even if not intentionally, I\u2019m really glad that I was able to experience something that helped me stop being delusional about \u201cchanging\u201d. And, considering my outward freakishness and pattern of behavior, I\u2019d hope that you\u2019d be even one percent as disgusted by me as I am by myself, because I believe that\u2019s the sensible attitude towards \u201cme\u201d. My plan was to go back to school in August. As much of what remains of delusional part of me wants that to happen and still believes that things will turn around, I hope that by point that for one reason or another won\u2019t occur; least of all so that I can\u2019t be a THREAT to all the actual HUMANS that I meet!

Im usually cheerfull, but i have periods where i get very depressed for months, start having suicidal thoughts. Its like there is no in-between. About 90% of the time there are intrusive thoughts in my mind, telling me to just kill myself. I've made it a game - i gave those thoughts bodies, theyre dark blue and green hedgehogs.

Yet, despite these accomplishments, I am plagued by desire to just be gone. This realization has led me to a troubling conclusion: that these feelings may be a permanent fixture in my life. I do feel although I have friends, they are very much just passers by and it won\u2019t have much impact if I am no longer here. I can\u2019t live the rest of my life like this and my thoughts of acting on these impulses are becoming more and more tangible. I don\u2019t know what to do.", "1j4m7vl": "Looking for support and people like me. This is my first time posting on reddit so bare with me. I wanted to share this on a platform without my friends knowing my account. I'm 18F and graduated school in 2024. Ever since school ended I've felt so empty. I have a learning disability as well as anxiety and depression, I was diagnosed at a young age. I struggled making friends in school and had a hard time learning, I was also in the mental hospital in 11th grade. I was doing decent for a bit, taking my meds, going to therapy, etc. I felt normal, like I knew who I was. But recently, I feel like nothings working, the thoughts of not wanting to live and feeling hopeless are back. I've tried working at 2 different places but I'm so horrified. The second time I cried infront of the supervisor. My dad thinks I'm lazy, he tells me \"I'm only hurting myself\" and I know that, but I just can't seem to fix myself. It feels like I'm in a world that isn't meant for me, everyone around me has a place or something they're good at, but I don't. I was very into art and writing but now I can't even bring myself to do the things I love. I cant even play video games, I just scroll on my phone all day. I'm just so stuck right now, everything seems impossible. I don't want to die but I keep telling myself \"That's the only thing you can do\". And I can't be honest with my therapist because I'll be put into the hospital and my parents can't afford that. I'm so scared of myself. I'm so tired of trying to be a person.", "gypf57": "Does anyone else feel like they\u2019re faking their mental illness? I have anxiety, panic attacks, I self harm and I\u2019m mildly suicidal. For some reason I feel like I am faking all of it. So many people are actually faking it and self diagnosing that I feel like I might me faking it just like them. When I have panic attacks alone in my room, I stop myslef because I convince myself that I am doing it for attention. When I self harm I feel like I\u2019m doing it for attention even if I then hide it or do it in a place that is not visible to anyone. I convince that my intrusive thoughts of suicide and death are just something normal that most people feel and I\u2019m just blowing it out of proportion. Does anyone feel like this? I need to know that I\u2019m not alone. Edit: everyone is talking about getting jobs so I wanted to clarify. I\u2019m 16 years old. Thank you to everyone for you comments. It really made me feel less alone. \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc9e\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc95", "ocxm45": "Three years ago Thursday, I tried to end my life. On the anniversary, I was approved for my first apartment. F(24). I have wanted to be on my own for a long time, but due to my mental health, I haven\u2019t been trusted to do so, by myself or my family. I\u2019m grateful to my mom for staying by my side and helping me find the resources I needed to stay alive. I think Back to that night daily, and sometimes I still wish I\u2019d succeeded. But I didn\u2019t, and I\u2019ve had to move forward with my life. So here I am, almost 25, and I finally found a place to call home. The complex is by the river that I go to as my safe place, and they are not charging me for my animals because they know how vital they can be for your life. There\u2019s a dog park for my dog and windows overlooking the woods and the river for my cats to watch deer and birds go by. I\u2019m five minutes from every member of my family if I ever need help. It\u2019s a bittersweet feeling but I\u2019m proud of myself for taking time to focus on bettering my mental health. Being committed was scary at first but the medicine they found for me finally did the job without making me feel worse. I also was officially starboard with PMDD and found a birth control that works for me. I work full time at a library and am freelance writing on the side (my passion). Im so ready to move in in the next couple months.", "k1k3ee": "I grew up with a mentally ill parents. Mother had depression and bipolar and and father had rage issues. Terrible together. Absolutely terrible. I hated my father until I was in my 20s. Ever since I could remember he would scream and yell and break shit like a 2 year old having a meltdown over everything. If my mother didn't have the house clean or if my mother didn't make peas with supper or if the Christmas tree wouldn't stand up straight. My mother slept all day and would forget to feed me. I was 4 I believe, I know I wasnt in school yet. My mother would get up to send my brother to school and then would go back to bed. I would use the VCR and watch Cinderella over and over and over. If I got hungry I'd go get stuff out of the fridge. I would cry if I got to hungry and I couldn't find anything to eat. I'd cry and cry and try to wake my mother to get up and she wouldn't. She would moan and fall back to sleep. I remember crying so much and I had my Cinderella shoes on (my mothers heals) and I was kicking and my shoe flew off my foot and smashed the window. My mother finally got up and cried she knew my dad was gonna be mad. I remember her hugging me and saying sorry. My brother and i were left alone all the time from age 5 yr old and my brother was 8 and up. My mom worked nights and my dad worked days. When my mother left for work my father would wait til she left and then left us home by our selves. I dont know if he was to cheap to get a babysitter or just didnt care. My mom would get home at midnight and found us alone and scared and crying. We lived in an old house beside a cemetery. So every noise scared us. CPS was called once maybe more but they only came to my house once and never came back. My mom cried all the time. She also lied and stole all the time and would take me with her when she stole and if she got caught she would lie...ill fast forward this. Years later when I was 12 my parents came into my bedroom and told me my dad was leaving. I never felt so happy. He was so mean towards my mother. I thought finally we can live happily. Boys was I wrong. I didnt know about metal illness. My mother couldn't cope. My dad took care of everything and did everything for her and worked so hard to keep food on the table. But as a kid I didnt see that. I saw just how mean he was all the time. My mother got very sick.. I didnt know what was going on. She started not eating except cottage cheese and jam. I tired getting her to eat other foods and she wouldn't. Then she started pretending to choke her self and buried our dishes in the snow in our yard. Also thought she was giving birth to my older brother. She started to forget who I was but always knew who my father was the great love of her life and my brother. She started to get jealous and mean towards me. One time I got home from school and I heard her screaming and I ran into her room and she called me nurse and asked me to help her. Said the baby is coming. Then pissed in her bed and said where's the baby. Where is the baby. And passed out. I called 911. She was in and out of the hospital. They kept sending her home saying nothing is wrong with her. I tried to get her to sign a child tax cheque so I could go get us (my mom, brother and I) groceries. And she flipped out said I gave her a pen that didn't work and that I must work for the government and punched me in the face. My mother never hit me before. Never. I then ran into my room crying and and she came after me. I was lucky i had a lock on my door. I called my father to come get me that something is wrong with my mother as she was pounding on my door trying to get into hurt me. My older brother lived in the basement and I barely saw him. He use to be so mean to me growing up I didnt bother with him much. It got to the point that I couldn't stay in the house with my mother and my friend mom let me stay with her. Finally after my mom lost so much weigh and was so so sick that my bother called my mothers sisters and they came down and the doctors finally took it seriously and she was admitted for mental health. My father moved back into the house and I moved back home. My father still a Workaholic so I barely saw him but he wasn't angry anymore. There was no more yelling and he took us to go see our mother at the hospital. It was terrifying. Ill never forget the smell of the hospital and the people looked like zombies. My mother talked so fast and her eyes looked so different and she talked about God about how God heard her and is saving her and she showed me something she made in work shop out of clay. How she was in darkness in this cave and God opened up the cave and gave her light again. Fast forward to 6 months she was in the hospital. I was home with 2 of my girl friends and my mother came in the door and I said mom! I felt so happy to see her and she wouldn't even look at me like I didnt exist and she packed her things and left. Did not even say a word to me. Just left. I felt something change inside me that day. I was so hurt. My mother wasn't well but the love she gave me and showed me as a child when I got hurt or when I was having a bad day. It was like she could make it better. She ended up moving back in months later and it she was different. It was like she didn't care about anything, blamed everyone for her problems, if she got caught in a lie she would blame it on something else. She didn't seem to care about anything other then money and stuff. She started filling our house with stuff. So much stuff and clothes. My dad stayed and his rage came back... I got sexual assaulted when I was 13 and my girl friend saved me from him going further with me. She heard me crying and telling him to stop... I never felt so scared. He made me look him in the eyes and kept telling me he wouldn't make me do anything I didnt want to do.... and i kept telling him i didnt want to do anything. He wouldn't listen. Tears running down my face as he was doing what he wanted. My friend and her bf came running over and said what the hell are you doing. He let go of me and I ran. I ran so fast. I didnt know where to go but to just run..... I felt like I had no one to talk to. I got so depressed my friend told the guidance counselor at school what happen and she brought me in and then called the police. When my father picked me up from the police station. He said \"boys don't know what to do now a days\" and my mother cried and said nothing. It still bothers me to this day what my father said to me. Didnt ask if I was alright or he'd kill the bastard. He should of just said nothing like my mother instead of what he said.... We went to court and bc it was his first offense he got probation and had to stay 500 feet away from me. Boys seem to scared to even come near me. People at school didnt believe me. I heard them say how can you get sexual assaulted. She must of did something. I ended up quitting school. My father got a job in away and moved out again when I was 17. I got a job at subway and moved out with my boyfriend. Who would cheat on me and I would always take him back. I went back to school and got my high school diploma and I applied for college. I took my boyfriend with me to the city and left the town.... should have left him in the town. He brought me down so much. He quit his job while I was in school so we lived off on my student loans and I worked and I couldn't take the stress I quit school and focused on working. He signed up for the military. My father bought all the things he needed on the list to go. And he left. Bf brother and preganet girlfriend move in with me to our small one bedroom apartment. (Thats another story...) anyways ill fast forward this too. We end up breaking up a year after the military. I was completely heart broken. I thought he was the one but I knew i couldn't take him back this time. I made a list of everything I ever wanted to try and do. I move in with my brother and then one by one I was checking off my list and I started to feel better and started having confidence and loving life. I went to 5 different dance glasses aweek, gym, I bought a pink bike. I always wanted a pink bike so I went out and got it for my self. I went para sailing, white water rafting, tidel bore rafting , zip lining and going out with gf, getting my hair done monthly and read alot more books. Its funny the things you give up about your self when your in the wrong relationship. My ex ended up wanting me back 9 months later and I told him I'm never taking him back and that its over for good. I never felt so good to be rid of him. I wanted to have a relationship with my parents again so I got my license and would go home to visit and help them out and take them to doctors appointment etc we grew close. My dad went to therapy got help with his anger. My mother was always obsessed with my father. Wanted him back would cry all the time and then get really mean. It was an everyday thing. She wanted to know everything about him. Even when she had a boyfriend she would obsessed over my dad. It was so sad. I would tell her she has to move on and live a happy life. But its like she couldn't. My brother stopped talking to our mother. Couldn't deal with the toxic relationship. I met the love of my life from a different province when I was 26 and 2 years after we met we moved in together and started a family. My mother got sick and had to get a bag when my first born was 5 months old. Her mental state declining saying horrible things about me and everyone. Very racist and Homophobic said terrible things to the nurses and doctors. She was pissed i couldn't take care of her. But I had a 5 month old and breastfeeding, I couldnt do much. She got home care but her house was so full of stuff they couldn't make it in past the livingroom. fast forward again... My mother now imagines things, thinks people are following her, thinks her phones and house is tapped and says the most outrageous things to me. Said she had sex with her Psychiatrist but now thinks he's someone else bc his hair looks different or if he goes to the bathroom his twin comes out. Still obsessed over my father and they haven been together in 20 years. If i don't answer her calls she will call my inlaws say terrible horrible things that aren't true about me. She thinks I traveller's the world. I always say I wish that was true. But now this past year she started calling me awful names. I wont repeat but it is awful. And says if I dont let her talk to the children she'll call CPS on me and my job and my inlaws and say these hurtful and untrue things about me. I went to her family doctor and tried to get power of attorney but it was her Psychiatrist is the one who deemed her capable! She lives in a house that is so disgusting filled with food, clothes, cat shit, and is imagining things but says she is capable. He wont even meet with me or our family.... I dont understand how he can deem her capable when he doesn't know the truth. Nor seems to care about the truth. Her family doctor, seniors safety and peoples protections are all involved and agree my mother needs help. But said they can't help people who don't want to be helped. Unless I get power of attorney. My father use to pay her Alimony but retired so she has no income except old age pension. She doesn't have enough for food and bills. I try and help with food but everytime I gave her money she would go out and buy stuff not food. She is so mean towards me and I know its her mental health and I tried so hard to help her. But I get so depressed when I talk to her. I feel anxiety when I feel like I should go see her or talk to her. My kids are scared of her. Everyone in my family has disowned my mother even her church bc my mother would say the meanest untruthful things. She is alone. Makes me feel guilty she is alone. But she does it to her self. I tried so hard to get her help. Unsure what to do now. Growing up no one asked if I was ever ok. No one talked to me about mental health. I honestly hate talking to her. But she's my mother so I feel guilty not talking to her bc I know she's sick. I know she was physically abused and emotionally abused by her mother and by my father. I know she is ill. But sometimes I feel alone in knowing what to do and I dont want history to repeat its self. I dont want to be like either one of my parents.. I know it must be so hard being mentally ill. Its also so hard living with someone being mentally ill. When she has good days I end up crying. Brings me back to when I was little and how loving and caring she was. It doesn't last tho. No one talks about the kids who live or lived with mentally ill parents and how to cope.

My psychologist has really been getting me to expose myself to uncomfortable situations especially when you know they're going to be uncomfortable. I kind of figured she had a boyfriend/didn't date customers or whatever but I considered this an experiment in allowing myself to become uncomfortable, and just sitting with that feeling for a while. It's this kind of stuff that almost literally rewires your brain (albeit small amounts over time). If you keep avoiding things, your brain will get used to it and that's how you end up using avoidance to deal with being uncomfortable. If you expose yourself to those uncomfortable situations and allow them to run their course, those feelings start to become a lot less scary over time which can help build confidence.

For context, I'm turning 20 soon. When I was 16, 1 became best friends with a girl named Stacey. We were close up until the spring of my junior year (I was 17). Around that time, I was in a toxic situationship with an older drug dealer named jack. It wasn't even a real relationship, but I was trauma-bonded to him. During spring break, Stacey confessed that she had slept with jack and profusely apologized. At first, I accepted her apology, but after a week, I couldn't even bear looking at her. Eventually, I cut her off completely. My three best friends supported me through the whole thing and also stopped being friends with her out of loyalty to me. Fast forward to now: Stacey reached out to me last fall with a long, heartfelt apology. After thinking about it for a while, I decided to forgive her. Since then, we've been in nonstop contact-texting, calling, and rebuilding our friendship. She's actually moving back to Florida (where I live) this Monday, and we'll probably start hanging out again. The problem? I haven't told my three best frie yet. I know they're going to have strong opinion because they cut Stacey off for me back then. One of them knows Stacey apologized but assumes we only follow each other now. Another knows she reached out but bashed her immediately, so I never told him we stayed in contact. The third has no idea about any of it. I feel nervous, even though I know I'm allowed to make my own choices.

Just sang songs about god, beating around the bush and making it clear that she would be going to \"heaven\" and not \"hell\" even though everyone knows she did the big bad and committed \"sin\". No recognition at all for the pain she had obviously been dealing with silently for her entire life. I posted on her memorial site, just a quick blurb of some memories I had with her, a nice photo of us when we were young, and I quick sentence at the end basically saying \"Some of us face our struggles silently, and you never know who could be fighting an invisible battle, so always be there to lend a shoulder to someone, whether they ask for it or not.\" And I linked NAMI and the suicide hotline. They fucking deleted my post and asked me to take all references to suicide or struggles out. They reached out to my parents too to try and reign me in. I'm honestly appalled.

I have given up on asking for help. I have been trying to get answers on my mental health for 10+ years and never got any answers or real help.

I have a very good friend, she is literally a ray of light in my gray life, but I almost never have a sincere interest in talking to her about anything. The interest is only superficial and it never went away, and I can't allow the fact that she communicates with someone else, half of her friends hate me because I have quarreled with everyone, but I know that she loves and appreciates me, but I do not deserve this. I don\u2019t deserve anyone to appreciate me, I feel like my tyrant father, I feel like some kind of owner and I distance myself from her at any mistake, saying very offensive things that I later regret, while communicating with other people and trying to hurt her somehow, this makes me want to smash my head through the wall even more.", "1jhcmww": "Loneliness fueling depression Dealing with loneliness I just recently turned 30 years old. I\u2019ve never had a serious relationship, no matter how hard I tried. I\u2019ve gone through the dating apps , friends of friends, everything, but I just can\u2019t seem to click with anyone. Over the last 2 years, I have made some serious changes to my health. There is a post on my profile about it, but basically I went from drinking 40ish beers a week to occasionally 2 a week, if that. I have lost 60 lbs, I go to the gym to keep myself in the best shape I\u2019ve ever been in, and I work construction. I did all of these changes for me, for my health, but I\u2019d be lying if I said I didn\u2019t want a relationship out of it. I constantly seem to end up in the friend zone. I\u2019m not particularly good at talking to girls, though I think I\u2019m better now than I used to be. This all came to a head over the last couple weeks. I met a girl at my climbing gym and hit it off with her. We started climbing together a bunch, hung out for a bite to eat a few times, and I thought the vibes were great. She even told me that she was really looking forward to spending time with me. Last weekend, we went out for a chill night out together and again I thought we were hitting things off really well. I dropped her off at her place, said goodnight and made tentative plans to hang out during this past week. When I got home though, I got that dreaded text that I\u2019ve gotten 1000 times before: \u201cI just got out of a really toxic relationship, and as much as I like spending time with you, I\u2019m not ready for that again yet\u201d. I immediately felt all of that old self doubt slamming into me like a ton of bricks. I sent her a message saying I understood, and I hoped we could still spend time together as friends, seeing if maybe this could turn into something. She heart reacted that, and responded absolutely. I figured at least that\u2019s a start. However, she has not responded to hardly any messages this week. The plan had been for me to help her move some furniture and other things this week, but each time I asked for a time to help her out, she came up with some reason why she couldn\u2019t(they could be true, probably are, just feels like she\u2019s avoiding me).

Is it because of my depression? For some reason, I find it really difficult to initiate conversations or send replies to someone through texts or e-mails. There are a few people who I have been able to get to know face-to-face, but for some reason I can't bring myself to talk to them through the internet. I keep on second-guessing myself, my mind coming up with the worst-case scenario. There's this constant assumption that the other person doesn't want to talk to me and get to know each other better. This becomes worse in situations I get left on read - even if it's someone who I enjoy talking to, it's really hard to start another conversation because I fear that I'm being left on read because the other person has no interest in interacting with me. I also put off replying to texts all the time. It's like I have to forcefully muster up courage for me to give a reply. Even when the other person's reply is quick, it takes hours or even days for me to give a response. It's to the degree where people are telling me to reply faster. It's not something that should be hard to do, and I know in the back of my head that it's a factor in my inability to socialize with others. Even so, I just can't seem to maintain conversations. And what's even more frustrating is I can't grasp why I'm like this. I thought I was just procrastinating, but the thing is, I want to converse, I want to talk more with others, but I can't. Can I label it procrastination if it's a task you want to do? So I've been wondering if this problem is related to my depression, or some other another mental disorder.

And the grief that follows is awful. I wasn't close or had much contact with their family member, but seeing the aftermath. It's not worth it. It's never worth it. I've recently had an enormous amount of guilt about the fact I ever tried to take my own life. The thought that I could have done that to my friends not even my family but my friends. To think that I could have put that weight on their shoulders. Honestly you think in that moment that your suffering should end. I'm telling you now it's never ever worth it. I know when I was low I would tell myself no one would care, no one would mind if I did it. But after seeing this I'm telling you the people that you would affect after you're gone, you could never imagine. Keep going you got this.

I've done it, I've done the being alone, in every capacity I've been alone. I've been alone at home, work and public, I've booked hotel rooms and gone clubbing alone (which is incredibly dangerous) it didnt make me feel any better. solo shopping sprees, solo clubbing, solo life; it's not helpful. there is no learning how to be alone, there is only the realisation that you are. it hits you in waves, when you're cross legged on a hotel bed after clubbing on your own, crying because you realised the advice repeated to you ad nauseum wasn't good and you're back to square one without getting any further. in the process of learning how to be alone, I've realised nobody else is; at least not in public spaces. everyone else has friends, they're drinking and partying together, shopping together; anything you do alone, they are doing with their friends and having more fun than you. you can tune it out for a while and just go about what you're doing, but eventually you'll look around and see the happy couples and friends hanging out and it will hit you that you're the only one there by yourself and it completely ruins what you were attempting to do and ultimately it leaves you feeling worse. being lonely isn't something you can learn, it's also not something you can just be okay with. i think that ultimately, there is an innate need inside of everyone to have at least one person in our lives who we can talk to, at least semi regularly. in the modern day, we have ai chat bots, discord calls, facetime etc and i think those fill part of the void, as long as you're able to let them, but the veneer wears off that eventually, usually when you have the lucidity to look around your room and realise you're the only one there. this experiment with loneliness and attempting to follow advice has been helpful i suppose, if for no other reason, it has taught me what doesn't work. i can't say it won't work for anyone, but it didn't work for me. i don't know what I'll do now, or where to begin filling this void, i only know i have to find a way before it kills me. I'm so lonely that it's all i can feel these days. i feel like I'm in solitary confinement, watching everyone else get to have fun and be social. i don't know what makes me so different, so fundamentally unlikeable, but when i find it, I'll happily remove it from myself if i can, even if it takes a huge chunk of my personality with it. I'm so desperate for social interaction that i cry at the thought of having a friend one day. i think i just wanted to write something about my recent experiences that other people might see.

Three years later, she gets pregnant. We were both young, and scared, but I tell myself I will do anything I can to make it work. I have a baby. I cry. I promise MY baby girl the world, and the love I never had. But then things change. The woman lives with her parents, I no longer can stay there with her and her family due to \"covid.\" Okay thats fine. Go to the store? Quarantine for two weeks. Saw someone? Quarantine for two weeks. Quickly realized my opinion is not regarded about the baby. My input has no sway on how to raise her. Suddenly feel like a babysitter, I am \"allowed\" to come over after work, watch the baby, while her mom ignores me. Eventually the woman I fell in love with starts being distant. It's little things at first. She doesn't want to cuddle. She stops kissing me. She stops inviting me to things. Then she tells me she's gay. I decide I can make it work right? I love this woman! She says she wants to be with me still? I'll make it work of course. But then she starts antagonizing me. Insinuating I am a bad father for not being there full time for the baby when I dont have a choice. Ignoring me. Arguing with me. I am... heartbroken. I don't know how else to describe it.

I told my wife I was going out for a little while. She knew something was going on and refused to let me leave the house. She physically grabbed me, made me look her in the eyes and told me everything was fine. It brought me out of my head.

I *am* from a rich family, people have always expected me to be on top of everything ever since I learned to walk, but I was never able to be on top. I've always sucked at everything.

If I'm talking to someone, I'll end up: - Mirroring their personality. I start acting like them, obviously. My values are entirely based off of theirs.

Let me fucking tell you something. I am so sick and tired of hearing people say that suicide is selfish. You want to know what's fucking selfish? Expecting someone else to live for you. Expecting someone to put their own personal pain to the side for your fucking happiness. Expecting your relationship or companionship to be that saving grace to pull anyone through a deep depression. THAT is the epitomy of selfish. It is no one's responsibility to do anything that makes other people happy or comfortable. You are not owed any of that. You don't get to tell someone who's suicidal that they're selfish for considering it and that they should think about others egos before their suffering. You don't get to call someone selfish after they commit suicide because they didn't think about everyone else's feelings when they obviously couldn't even handle their own. On top of the fact that it's disrespectful to speak ill of the dead. How selfish do you have to be to have the audacity to call someone selfish when you are the one who wants a dangerously depressed person to continue suffering just so you can continue to ignore all the symptoms but hand them a god damn gold start sticker for being alive like it fucking helps anything? And before you even bring religion into the conversation, news flash, Not everyone believes in your God so telling someone \"God doesn't make mistakes\", \"Suicide is a sin\", \"God only gives us what we can handle\", or some other idiotic bullshit, doesn't bring everyone comfort and sometimes it makes things worse. And that's not your opportunity to tell them all the ways they need to find God. Because again: Not. Everyone. Believes. In. Your. Fucking. God. End of. Telling a suicidal person that wanting to end their pain is selfish will only tell them that they cannot confide in you and it marks you as an unreliable support system. It will more than likely make them pull away from you and make them feel even more isolated. YOU'RE NOT HELPING! And don't use the excuses \"I've been through worse and I don't want to kill myself\" or \"Other people have it worse\" because you obviously don't understand what mental illness is. Being depressed about a situation is so much different than being clinically depressed. Situational depression lasts through a particular struggle. Clinical depression is being sad for almost no god damn reason. Don't compare the two because you're only making yourself look like more of an asshole. It is selfish of you to want someone to continue suffering just to make you happy.

I feel like it's a sign I need to step up my action against depression. What are some things I can do to alleviate my depression? The title and this story may sound fake (New account to hopefully protect my identity), but I swear to you it could not be more real for me. I wanted to share this, I am not doing this for attention but merely to seek help. More questions will be asked at the end of my story. As the title describes, a miracle has occurred given the severity and intent of the crash. The paramedics, police, doctors, nurses and my parents all gave me the most puzzled look of their lives when they asked how fast I was going, and I replied \"200 km/h\". I have been depressed for 4 years now. Nothing has been working and my mental health has declined terribly. I have been on multiple medications, tried behavioural therapy such as cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), and even went a course of Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). First my motivation to do anything went down; I couldn't eat, do school work and most importantly, socialize. My social circle grew smaller as my depression grew bigger, after 4 years of suffering as well as other health conditions such as horrible eyesight (+10.00 in each eye with astigmatism), sleep apnea and anxiety, I figured life wasn't going to get any better and I decided to end my life. I drove to the mountains where I decided I would find a large hill, go full speed down it and either turn into the median or drive off the road, ultimately killing myself. About 3 hours from my hometown I found the perfect hill, The road was steep, perfect for gaining speed to ensure a fatal crash. Without thinking too much (I would just talk myself out and not commit), I pulled a U-turn and drove to the hill which was about 5 minutes after that point. They say your life flashes before your eyes, mine played back to me for those 5 minutes. The most important people and influential moments of my life appeared before my eyes. They suddenly disappeared as I approached my chosen hill. My foot automatically floored the gas pedal, I placed my left foot behind the brake so I wouldn't back out. I raced down the hill, gaining more and more speed, by the time I reached the bottom, my car (which only has a speedometer for up to 200 km/h. I saw the road start to bend and I jerked my wheel into the opposite direction of the turn, slamming the front end of the car into the median. That was the last thing I remembered before waking up in my car, with tapping on the window from bystanders. All I could think to myself at that moment was \"wow, I so much of a failure I can't even kill myself\". A bystander described to the paramedics and police that I hit the median, did about 10 spins (no flips) and then continued to scrape median down the hill for another 250m. I got a glimpse of my car before I was taken away in an ambulance, it was completely destroyed. When I arrived to the hospital I was placed in the trauma room however, the doctor was incredibly surprised after seeing me sitting upright with consciousness after a 200 km/h car accident. He assessed me and ordered a full-body CT scan. The results came back clean, no bleeding, no broken bones and most importantly, no death. He then admitted me to the psychiatry ward (which I won't get into on this post but it was a nightmare!!!). The everyone's surprise I was barely injured, walking away with a concussion with memory loss at most. This phrase really stuck in my mind because nearly every person I have talked to so far has said: \"It's a miracle you're alive\". I'm not religious, but I agree, it is a miracle I'm alive, and I\"m not going to waste it. I'm begging for help because I know this community loves to help people when they reach out. I really want to try and beat my depression but I don't know how. I have tried CBT, I'm going BACK to ECT for another round of treatment and I'm on increased medication. I will be seeing counsellors and psychiatrists, however thanks to Canadian healthcare not until 2020 (which is one of the reasons I decided to end it, due to lack of resources). If anyone out there has any tips on how to manage severe depression and anxiety please let me know. I'm still alive today despite the severity of the crash, and I believe it's a sign that I need to conquer this depression and do something great with my life. I am tired of laying at home, with no energy and no motivation, wasting away my life every day with my depression. I can personally say even those who are suiciding don't want to die, they merely just want to stop existing. Please help with any advice you have, I'm begging for my life to change, please. I am trying my best to push past my depression and suicidal thinking so I can give life another try. Here are a list of specific questions that would benefit a lot: \\-How do I keep up my motivation despite having no energy all the time? \\-How can I keep up or have more energy? \\-I'm thinking of going back to school for Nursing, my current position (lab tech) doesn't feel fulfilling and I'm looking for something more. Is nursing school a good idea or will that just make my life more stressful?) \\-What are some habits I could do to alleviate my depression \\-Any secret self-help/feel good tips? \\-How do I make more friends and build a better support network? \\-What do I tell to my friends who have noticed I just \"disappeared\" for a few days? &#x200B; Thanks to those who took the time to read this post, I usually get little to no reads on Reddit but I thought I'd share this anyway since not many people can say they survived a 200 km/h automobile suicide attempt and walked out with minor injuries. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask. Edit: more questions Edit 2: Thank you, everyone, for taking the time to write to me. I truly didn't believe this would reach this many people. I will try and reply/read everyones post but I am still in the process of seeing a lot of specialists. But I am truly grateful for all the love and support that has been sent my way.

I really don't want this to be seen at the front page of the subreddit as the thought of that feels disturbing. Anyways, without making myself too comfortable in the process, I always had a thing for thinking about unconscious/passed out women as long as I knew myself, like even around 4 or 5 as said in the title. I would dream about that stuff in the primary school and even a clearer example was how I dragged a girl around on the floor (just at normal speed) while we were playing (with her agreeing to play of course) (and we were of course both 4 or 5) and she was acting like she was a fish and I hunted her (silly, I know but kids are kids) in the kindergarten. And I enjoyed that \"game\" we played, like, a lot. Carrying her around like that was so... hot? It can't be at that time as the thing down there wasn't working yet, but it was so enjoyable in a way I can't describe. There were also scenes from the cartoons I watched I would later find from the internet or desperately wait for the scene to appear again TV that included similar or the same things that gave me this same feeling. What's weirder is that, I've been interested in similar kinks as long as I entered puberty, still to this day. Now, I know the fundamentals of this stuff to some degree, at least. I'm not claiming to be an expert but I'm just trying to stay informed. I've done a lot of reading about it even though I didn't get a chance to partake in a scene so far. I know that the trust and consent are the keys, and the importance of safewords and the traffic light system, or something equivalent, and I of course wouldn't try to act out these kinks I didn't mention with someone who doesn't agree to them. Maybe I'm getting too defensive and making too detailed explanations here without a particular reason, but I just don't want to come off as a creep, better to be safe than sorry. So, what might have caused this interests? I'm not asking for a diagnosis as that's impossible to do through internet. It's just... I trust my therapist but there are still stuff I can't talk face to face with him. Like, my mind just goes in a protection mode where I have a hard time analyzing those topics I try to bring to the table, I just lose all my thinking energy that's needed for critical thinking out of stress and my defense mechanism based on some events in the past; but this is a lot easier to do when you're doing this on the internet for obvious reasons.

I don't have anyone and don't want to feel so alone today. Today is my birthday and this sounds pretty sad, but I just want someone to wish me a happy birthday and maybe say something nice. I no longer have any friends or family left and just want some sort of human connection, even if it is just over Reddit, to make me feel just a bit less isolated and forgotten. I have just endured so much lately and I don't have anyone to talk to or confide in, but I thought I could make it through today just fine. I was wrong. I feel stupid and pitiful while I'm typing this, but I just want to know someone is out there and understands.Getting to this point happened without me even realizing how solitary I had become until I was completely alone. I might as well lay it out, as just the act of typing it might be some sort of catharsis. So how did I end up here? I started typing out damn near my whole life story, but that made this post so long that if I left it included there was an even smaller chance someone would read this. So highlights then? Abandoned by parents, raised by grandparents, abused by neighbor from ages 5 to 8, horrible abandonment issues, started getting into drugs, dropped out of high school, got a GED, some life happened, was totally Goth, some more life happened, made some music and art, now only Goth on the inside, started college, got married, wife left and grandparents arrested/institutionalized due to Alzheimer's/dementia in the same weekend, abruptly left college to move home to sort everything out, oh hey drugs, slowly watched my only family deteriorate before my eyes until they didn't even recognize me any longer, raging heroin addiction to try not to feel any of this, grandfather died, got in trouble with the law, lost everything I owned, homeless junkie interlude, lost almost 3 years of my life in jail/prison over less than $4,000 worth of bad checks, oops can't get a decent job due to criminal record, congestive heart failure, almost die, start getting my life back together, meet a nice girl, marry nice girl, grandmother dies, oh hey again drugs, finally got off the drugs, surprise wife departure, heart failure keeps getting worse, can barely walk, can't work anymore, no job, no insurance, no access to healthcare. That about sums it up the backstory. I finally have gotten some healthcare and counseling. Sadly, I can no longer work. I'm trying to go through the disability process, but that takes a great deal of time. It is difficult without proper access to the doctors I need, but I'm getting there. I've also been clean for 4 years and I'm never going back to that dependence. Never before in my life did I ever feel like I was completely done with drugs, but this time it has really stuck. Haven't even had any cravings and now it never even crosses my mind. I'm finally in a good and stable place in my recovery. Now I have other issues though. Poverty is very real. The threat of eviction looms nearly every month. Being able to afford the 12 different prescriptions I take is really hard and I find myself cutting pills in half because even $70 a month for medicine is a real challenge. I was able to get enrolled back in college and that is the plan of how to survive until I graduate and find work I'm physically able to handle. I'm working towards a career in counseling because I want to be able to use all of these nightmare experiences to help other people. I want to use what time I have left on this planet to help others and hopefully leave it better than I found it. That is how you end up alone on your 40th birthday, typing on an ancient laptop that you pray survives a couple more months until you transfer schools and can get a replacement with financial aid funds. My family died. Drugs pushed everyone away for years except other drug addicts and an addict isn't anyone's friend. I am no longer able to work, so I don't have those human connections anymore. My wife had been my best friend, so when she surprised me by suddenly leaving the last person I had a connection with went with her. Now that my congestive heart failure has progressed just walking enough to shop for groceries, take out the trash, or getting the mail is a huge challenge, so just going out to walk around and meet people is near impossible. Having zero available disposable income also doesn't help. If I can hold on a couple more months and everything works out I'll be able to switch schools and have more aid options that will take care of my financial and healthcare needs. I'm just trying to hold on and it is so hard. There is the abbreviated story if you somehow stopped on this post and actually read through everything. If you made it this far, thank you for listening. If you have the time to say happy birthday or say something nice I would really appreciate it. You really don't know how much it would mean to me. No one else is going to tell me today, so you might get to be the only person that wishes me a happy birthday. I don't get any presents or any cake. I don't get a birthday meal or get to do anything cool. I don't get to go anywhere or see anyone. There won't be any birthday cards in the mail or celebratory emails. That's okay though. If one person manages to take the time to read this and let me know there is someone, anyone out there then it'll be alright. &#x200B; Edit: Update - Thanks so much to everyone. I barely have any words. Just thank you all so very much. You did bring a grown man to tears, but the best kind.

A little background on him: studying in 12th science suffering from low/negative self worth, regrets, anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation, self doubt, hopelessness, academic stress/pressure etc. (None of these conditions are officially diagnosed) #An outline of what has caused his suicidal thoughts recently: He took a decision a while ago and couldn't stick to it and is about to face/facing the consequences which has led to his suicidal thoughts. As for now, I've taken necessary steps to ensure his well being for the next 2-3 months but I don't know how to help him anymore besides professional help. P.S: I've always tried my best to help him and never invalidated his feelings. #The full story: [Had to attach it as an image due to character limit restricted] [P.S: I'm new to reddit so please forgive me if I've broken any rules, and this is a repost as the OP's format was messes up] #My advice: I've advised him to open up to his parents about everything because who knows maybe they might consult a psychologist. He's reluctant to seek professional help because he can't afford it on his own and doesn't want to involve his parents as he thinks they'll consider him to be weak for needing professional help. #His options (acc. To him) Now according to him he has two options (the latter being the best in his opinion): 1: Open upto his parents sooner or latter (because the discussion is inevitable as he will have to discuss with them ultimately when the results are out) and then take a drop year which involves pressure from literally everywhere: self+parents+family+the fact that he's wasted a year and failed once+expensive. 2: End everything before the results are out. According to him, this is the best option as it is the ultimate solution to all of his problems. Now honestly, I don't wanna lose a great friend like him. Just a little information about him, he values mental health more than anyone else I know, but is still a little biased about professional help (a little orthodox mindset about professional help ig). Even I'm living with the burden of not having called his parents yet and told them everything which I think would make things worse or weird idk. I could call his parents and tell them everything even if it costs me our friendship because honestly it's way better than regretting having done nothing later. As for taking a drop year, he's afraid of facing everything once again and is certain the he'll fail once again. He has a very pessimistic mindset and negative views about himself. And looking on the positive side, if he does make it even in a top institution, with or without a drop year, he's afraid of the things he'll have to face in future like socializing+communication+building confidence (he's very underconfident right now). P.S: he never really shows whatever he's going through. Always plays dumb or immature or happy/neutral. And he's never had a well/healthy relationship with his parents either so the fact that opening up to his parents is difficult is understandable. Now my question for you guys is what should he do without feeling more crappy than he already is? Or what can I do for him to ease his sufferings?

My partner of 3 years struggles with BPD and has experienced a lot of trauma in her life. Over the past several months she's attempted suicide several times and she's been self harming. Each of these attempts resulted in her voluntarily admitting herself to a mental health facility but each time after a short while (2 weeks at most) she would check herself out, be doing ok for about a month, and then another attempt and another stint in a facility. Yesterday there was another attempt and she's currently staying with her dad because she wasn't admitted this time. I want a future with her, I want to have kids and a home and a real future but with this pattern it's not possible to have that. I'm considering establishing an ultimatum that she goes through a program at a mental health facility in full or I leave.

Please, if you have a perspective on this that would be valuable or if you think I'm going about this the wrong way, voice that.

But I\u2019m getting the point to where I can\u2019t keep going on. Nothing inside of me has strength anymore. I\u2019m typically the happy, go bubbly, optimistic type of person, but lately no part of me has been that way. I\u2019ve never felt this unhappy and confused in my life.

But I\u2019ve never felt the emptiness I do now. I go back and fourth between being so depressed that I dissociate to the point to where I\u2019m completely numb or to where my depression consumes me.

And a partner who turns on me and causes issues when I allow myself to feel emotions. The sad thing is, is that although they occasionally turn on me, it\u2019s the most support I\u2019ve ever received. I grew up in a family where mental health was stigmatized and I wasn\u2019t allowed to talk about my feelings. I was also always both the punching bag growing up since I was the child who never got in trouble and the counselor of the family that was expected to resolve all of my family problems while also being there for adults while they were never there for me and would belittle me for having emotions or mental health issues. Still to this day, I feel like I can\u2019t even have a panic attack around anyone else based on the horrible ways I\u2019ve been treated from having them infront of other people. I\u2019ve had people who are supposed to love me- mock my panic attacks, belittle & shame me, and yell at me for having them while simultaneously never comforting me. Anytime I\u2019ve ever needed someone they leave when I need them the most, no matter who it is.

At first I thought he was just trying to cuddle or get me to pet him, but I then noticed instead of rubbing into my hand, he was pushing the knife away. I broke down into tears and he immediately climbed into my lap. I moved and he laid beside me, and now refuses to let me out of his sight.

Your suffering does not need justification. You feel what you feel. Screw invalidating statements like \"It's just hormones\". 4. We all have our own journey don't compare your life/struggles to those of others. 5. You deserve growth as a human being even if you don't feel like you do. Our illnesses cloud our perspective of the past, present, and future. 6. Don't believe everything you think. 7. There is no \"cure\".

I don\u2019t even think I want to care, but I know it\u2019s expected, so I\u2019m trying to act the part. Not because I actually want to be more empathetic, but because I was raised by loving parents, and I want them to see me as \u201cnormal.\u201d It just makes things easier. I\u2019m a perfectionist, which makes everything feel like a cycle of frustration. I lose interest in things and get bored so easily. Nothing holds my attention for long unless it constantly keeps me on edge. That, combined with how I see people, makes me feel kind of disconnected from everything. I have no emotional attachment to anyone, and I\u2019ve lost any sympathy or empathy I used to have for real people. But weirdly enough, I can still cry over fictional characters. That\u2019s what made me start testing myself\u2014watching disturbing things just to see if I\u2019d feel anything. I haven\u2019t actually done it yet, but the thought is there. I\u2019ve self-diagnosed with dysesthesia and symptoms of BPD, which might explain a lot of the emotional numbness I feel. But I don\u2019t talk about it with anyone. I avoid bringing up my problems because I don\u2019t want to worry anyone\u2014especially my family. At the same time, I feel lonely and isolated. It\u2019s a weird contradiction\u2014giving up on people but still wanting emotional connections. I used to skip college a lot, not because of academics (studies are ridiculously easy for me), but because I didn\u2019t want people pitying me for being alone, lonely, and smart. My father\u2019s reputation plays a huge role in how I conduct myself in school\u2014he\u2019s a well-respected person in a high position, so I\u2019m always expected to be at the top. That part never bothered me because I actually like proving I\u2019m smarter than most people my age. Maybe that\u2019s narcissism, but I enjoy meeting high expectations. I\u2019ve been sick and depressed since high school, and my parents worried about me a lot. Sometimes, I used that to my advantage\u2014playing the sick victim card to get what I wanted. Not that I was always faking, but I knew how to use their concern. I guess I\u2019m manipulative in that sense. But at the same time, people close to me never really care about my preferences. Conversations are always about them, never about me. My older sibling, who\u2019s extroverted and great at connecting with people, is basically everyone\u2019s favorite, which makes me feel inferior in comparison. I tried communicating with them, but they just aren\u2019t the type to handle serious conversations. Whenever I talk to my parents (my dad is logical, my mom is emotional), they either over-worry or just try to rationalize everything instead of actually listening to me. Now they expect me to study non-stop for my career, even telling me to cut my sleep because they don\u2019t think I\u2019m serious enough. I am serious, but my mental health makes it hard to focus. At this point, I\u2019ve just decided to make pretending my first nature. If I can act the way people expect me to, I won\u2019t have to deal with questions or concerns.

Their psychiatrist has diagnosed them with PMDD with some bipolar and OCD traits. They\u2019re autistic and have ADHD. They were previously on Fluoxetine and Vyvanse, but it triggered mania, suicidality, and toxicity. Now they\u2019re being discharged on Lamotrigine, an antipsychotic, Zoely (birth control for PMDD), calcium, Vitamin D, and a different stimulant. 1. Confused about \"taking too much accountability\" Last night, they told me: -They feel scared to come home because of our \"dynamic.\" -Their psychologist and social worker told them they\u2019re taking too much accountability for our conflicts because \"it takes two.\" -They feel like I\u2019m always criticizing them and never seeing the good. -They feel like my expectations are too high and that they can't meet them. -They don\u2019t know what this means for our future or whether we can even live together. -They feel like they don\u2019t even know what I look like anymore (it\u2019s been six days). -They said they\u2019re tired of masking around me\u2014but previously told me I was the one person they don\u2019t have to mask around. This really threw me. I never asked them to take 100% accountability - just to actually acknowledge and change the behaviors that hurt me. I don\u2019t understand what their team is telling them because, from my perspective, the cycle is: 1. I bring up a concern calmly. 2. They react defensively, shut down, or deflect. 3. I try to stay calm and explain my perspective. 4. They continue to deflect or misrepresent my concerns, and eventually, I get frustrated and reactive. 5. The original issue gets buried under their emotional response or my eventual frustration. 6. Later, they apologize and say they want to change, but the cycle repeats. I know my own reactivity is part of this, but I don\u2019t understand what \u201ctaking too much accountability\u201d means in this context. I know my partner often omits key details when speaking to mental health professionals (their conditions got so bad because they were under representing how bad it was for them) and I am wondering whether I'm in the wrong or whether they're not explaining the situation objectively to their team for them to say this. I've never blamed the 'dynamic' solely on my partner but I'll readily ask them to take accountability for their side of the road. And I do the same whether or not they raise this with me. I'm just confused. 2. My grandma died yesterday, and after begging for my partner's support, they still couldn't show up in a stable and supportive way despite being discharged and coming home today. When I spoke to them after she passed, they were cold, detached, and emotionally unavailable. Instead of holding space for me, they focused on their own fears about coming home, our relationship, and whether we should even be together. This isn\u2019t the first time. Every time I\u2019ve dealt with a major loss or crisis, they\u2019ve either been emotionally absent or actively made things worse. I don\u2019t feel emotionally safe with them. Meanwhile, I have supported them through: -Their mental health crises (including helping get them hospitalized). -Visiting them almost daily in the hospital while juggling my grandma's impending death and visits, an intense work schedule and schedule for second job and and a sick pet. -Picking up all household and financial responsibilities alone. -Advocating for their care and researching resources. -Providing patience, space, and emotional labor during their dysregulated episodes. I don\u2019t understand how I can do all of that, but it seems that they don't see it and think my requests for support are asking for too much? 3. \"Your expectations are too high.\" They told me they feel like I only ever criticize them and that my standards are impossible to meet. But my expectations are literally just: -Follow through on what you say you\u2019ll do. -Take responsibility for how your words/actions affect me. -Communicate instead of shutting down or getting defensive. -Be emotionally present and consider your feelings instead of immediately reacting to them as if they're true. They'll often hear criticism in my words that simply isn't there, or read into them the worst possible interpretation and I feel like I'm constantly saying 'i didn't say that though'. Recently, they've taken to saying 'intent doesn't matter' (because I told them that intent doesn't matter if they're running late and meant to text me but didn't for example) and so if they read into my words meaning that is literally not there that it's my fault because intent doesn't matter. I tell them, no, I said the words I said and that's all I mean. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s unreasonable. I don\u2019t expect perfection, just effort. 4. This used to just be PMDD, but now it\u2019s not. In the past, these patterns were confined to their luteal phase. But now, it\u2019s happening outside of luteal. I don\u2019t know if this is: -A medication reaction (they just started an antipsychotic and Lamotrigine and oral contraceptive) -A sign that there\u2019s another condition at play (bipolar? CPTSD? something else?). -The mask slipping and this is just who they are. They flip between loving me and acting like they barely care. Their opinion of me changes dramatically based on their emotions. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s real anymore. My questions: 1. What does it mean when a psych team says someone is taking too much accountability? What are they seeing that I\u2019m not? 2. Are my expectations actually too high? Should I just accept that this is all they can give? 3. Why do they only seem to realize what they\u2019ve done after the damage is done? Why does it take me getting upset for them to have self-awareness? 4. Has anyone dealt with something similar? How do you tell the difference between mental illness symptoms vs. fundamental personality traits? 5. Would breaking up be the only real option?

Generally I can deal with very horrible things okay, like I'll get drunk or have a panic attack but I'll be okay in a couple of days. But today something new happened. For context, I'm currently working at a psychiatric hospital (which I've done before) but in the adolescent unit for the first time in my career, starting about a month ago. It's been really hard but I love it. I love working with adolescents, I'm 27 and look/act 22 (according to myself and multiple patients) so that probably helps. But I just adore them. Today a patient, a 14yo girl, was so suicidal she was on 1:1 observation. We had to physically hold her this morning to keep her from bashing her head into the wall during a suicide attempt. Tonight it got worse. She tried every way to hurt herself (I really don't care to describe it all). It took 5 of us women (men trigger her even if they're within 3ft of her) to hold her down. Several women switched out but I stayed on her legs for the full 40 minutes because I had built a good relationship with her and I figured out how to position my body so that even when she pushed and kicked, she wouldn't hit my bones or anything. Unfortunately 2 of the other staff members didn't do the same. She kept screaming, begging to die. I've had those thoughts and screamed those things myself. Word for word. Every time a man came within 3ft of her, she SHRIEKED. And the supervisor/RN during that particular shift was a man, so he had to be at least somewhat nearby. I don't think I will ever forget this as long as I live. Her screams and shrieks, holding her as gently as I could, knowing that she is fucking FOURTEEN and in this kufh pain. I mean I was too at her age, but I know that's so far beyond normal there are no words for it. And I'm so scared that I'm now going to have a panic attack whenever someone screams. When I got home, a kid in the parking lot of my apartment who was playing catch with another kid screamed and I dropped to the ground and covered my ears. All I could hear was her screams. I can take this for a month. But what if this is another whole cause of ptsd coming on? I'm not leaving this career. I'm not leaving them, ever.

I\u2019m in the middle of a depressive episode and dealing with some great difficulties in my personal life. She didn\u2019t show up. This was my attempt to \u201creach out\u201d. Update: Sorry in advance, I\u2019m on mobile and this is long. I really wasn\u2019t expecting this amount of support and kindness from so many people. Thank you all for the uplifting words and thank you for the rewards! I\u2019d like to first address any concerns about meeting up during the pandemic. My friend and I made plans to meet up at a coffee shop, buy a quick cup of coffee, and then immediately head to a park nearby in separate cars. The coffee shop is on small a military base so that cuts the amount of people that were in there down by a lot. I went ahead and grabbed coffee and then waited on a bench outside of the shop for around 30 minutes or so before leaving. I stayed 6 feet away from others and wore a mask the entire time. I played it safe and went by the rules. Next I\u2019d like to say thank you to those who have helped me realize how big of an accomplishment it was for me to get to the coffee shop. It really did take a lot of effort and I appreciate the reminder that it took strength I didn\u2019t know I had. I also want to thank those who have expressed empathy towards my friend. She is going through a rough time and has been since long before the pandemic started. I wasn\u2019t angry at her because I understand that she\u2019s struggling too. I was just really sad and disappointed because I\u2019ve only seen her once since last year. It was more of a bummer than anything and I just needed somewhere to get it off of my chest so I came to Reddit. Kind people of Reddit, you did not disappoint! I\u2019m going to continue being her friend because she is very dear to me. Knowing the kind of person she is, she probably truly forgot, there was a potential miscommunication, or she may have had something come up that she couldn\u2019t get out of. It would have been nice to get a bit of a heads up or an explanation, but I haven\u2019t dwelled on it too much. She\u2019ll reach out when she\u2019s ready to. If not, then I understand that too. I\u2019ve been in therapy and medication since 2018 and recently sent a cease &amp; desist letter and went no contact with my mother. As a result of that I haven\u2019t heard from my Dad since it happened. I also live states away from my childhood friends and what\u2019s left of the family that supports me (not many people). I\u2019m better off being out of that toxic environment but it\u2019s still a grief process losing people that are still alive. I have also been grieving what could have been if I only had healthy and supportive parents. I\u2019m also struggling with my marriage. I\u2019m a military spouse and it\u2019s hard being so far away from the little support I have states away (my sisters). I won\u2019t go into detail here about my rocky marriage but it\u2019s been traumatic and hard. I haven\u2019t gotten much support other than therapy and the support my younger sisters have been capable of giving. I\u2019m in the process of filling out divorce papers and working with an attorneys office to explore my options. I also had surgery at the end of October to repair a hernia. It wasn\u2019t too big of a deal, and my sisters came from out of town to visit during my recovery, but it did knock me down a bit emotionally because I was restricted from carrying anything over 20 pounds. That meant I couldn\u2019t hold my toddler who is 30 pounds and that was really hard on both of us. It just would\u2019ve been nice to be able to have hung out and talked to the one friend I have here about everything going on. It honestly would\u2019ve been nice to talk about things that have nothing to do with all of the crap that has gone on this year too. It\u2019s okay though! Life will carry on and there will be better days. I still got my coffee, got outside, then came home and hung out with my son and put up Christmas decorations. I also got a ton of fantastic advise and support from you lovely folks. Thank you again! TL;DR Thank you for the support and kind words!

Any tips or advice for before, during and after a drive, would be greatly appreciated! Thanks! \u2014\u2014\u2014 For some of context, at the end of last year I finally got my driving license and more recently a car. I say finally as I\u2019m 27 and knowingly delayed learning to drive due to the anxiety of both driving in general and the process of getting a license. I had started learning to drive at 18, but when I moved away for uni, instead of continuing I convinced myself that I was too busy, which was partly true, but not entirely. I\u2019m still really proud that I took the steps to get my license despite the delay! I passed the theory a year earlier, delayed starting the practical training by about 6 months, then started learning with a driving instructor (as I don\u2019t have access to a car), and eventually passed the driving exam on my first try! I was so anxious for my first driving lesson that I contacted the school to reiterate that it\u2019d be my first time driving. They of course reassured me that it would be fine, and the instructor was really good and supportive throughout! I definitely know that the hardest part is getting started and that the more I drive, the more comfortable I\u2019ll be. BUT, my issue is that I\u2019m now doing this alone. Well obviously it was always going to come to this, but having an instructor next to me made me feel less anxious. I know I need to be calm while driving, but even the thought of getting into the car and driving somewhere is causing me to feel anxious. Like even now I\u2019ve been thinking of going out to run some errands for the last few hours, but the uncertainty of things is making me think that I should take a bus instead and while there scope out the area for how I\u2019d do it with a car. I\u2019ve currently only driven about twice since getting a car. My main areas of anxiety include: 1) Attempting to drive in/out of my apartment\u2019s parking garage (the ramp seems so narrow and yet two cars should supposedly be able to drive up/down next to each). 2) Parking in a bay especially between two cars (I never learned how to do this which is strange since I\u2019d probably do it a lot more than parallel park). 3) Parking in general (if I drive anywhere I\u2019ll need to park, but where and how does it work? What if I drive into a carpark and there\u2019s an issue and I\u2019m stuck? What if I don\u2019t find a space? Do I just go home?). 4) Turning into or from a side road where you need to wait until it\u2019s safe to do so (in approaching where I\u2019d want to turn, I feel like I\u2019ll start thinking \u2018what if I never find a gap?\u2019 or \u2018what if I can\u2019t actually turn here?\u2019 or \u2018what if I cause a hold up of cars?\u2019). There\u2019s probably some other things too, but again I\u2019ve only actually driven twice so I\u2019m not sure. I know overthinking definitely doesn\u2019t help either. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! I really enjoyed driving while I was learning, and I think I would enjoy it more if I wasn\u2019t so anxious. I\u2019ve procrastinated going out long enough, so I\u2019m going to try go out now. Honestly if I get out of the parking garage alone (and get back down), I\u2019d take it as a win!

How many times were you denied? Hello my friends :) I am trying to get approved for disability and I have several questions. I would love any input or advice you have! 1. Do you have to have been hospitalized due to mental illness? 2. Can you be approved if you have a lengthy employment history? 3. How many times were you denied before you got approved? 4. What is the approval process like? I am a 45f and have been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder, Bipolar Type 2, GAD, and Fibromyalgia. I have never been arrested, never been to jail, and never hospitalized. I have almost always had a job and almost always had my own apartment and my own vehicle. However... I can barely take care of myself. I have not showered in over a year. I do not cook, clean, do laundry, go grocery shopping or into any store for that matter. I am extremely lucky that I found my partner of 12 years and he does not hold this against me. Before I met him, I had slept with well over 150 people, male and female. I am scared to death of being alone. I have been to college 4 times and I have dropped out 4 times. I have had 27 different jobs, ranging from 1 day to 4 years. I have been fired at least 10 times. I have always had trouble with attendance and have signed many attendance contracts. Even though I have usually had my own place, I have moved 23 different times since turning 19. I would usually only stay long enough that the place got so dirty I couldn't stand it. So instead of cleaning, I would just move (unless I was kicked out for being late on rent, which also happened several times). The only reason I have never been homeless or hospitalized is because I have supportive family members. I have isolated myself so much that I no longer have any friends. The only person I talk to aside from my partner is my mom. Even though my partner does not have a drivers license (but I do), he is the only one that drives because I have too much anxiety behind the wheel. Over the last 10 years, I have been working from home because I have a hard time getting ready every day and being around people. Before getting laid off this last Sept, I have only been working part time. I've been unemployed for 5 months and I only have 3 weeks left of unemployment benefits. I'm having a really hard time finding a new job and my mental and physical health have greatly deteriorated. I know that most people are denied disability the first time they apply.

It hurts a lot to deal with at times and it recently came back and I feel awful. I cope with my problems by talking to people but there's nobody.

Then this evening I was at work delivering pizzas. I went to this one house and I wasn\u2019t sure if I was at the right address or not but there was a man in the driveway and I asked him if I was at the right address. He said he wasn\u2019t sure because it was his bosses house, not his, and he was only there to pick up his car. Then we started talking and he mentioned how I was smiling. He spoke about how he was 63 years old, he was a military veteran, and how with people my age he doesn\u2019t see people smile like I did. It was a fake smile I put on so when I greet customers it\u2019s a good experience.

This guy had no clue I was depressed and suicidal and was planning on taking my life 3 hours later, yet he still told me all of this. He ended up giving me some cheese he had (I didn\u2019t eat it) but the reason why he gave it to me is because the packaging had a huge smile on it and he told me to have it and to keep on smiling and spreading positivity.

My friend \"A\" is the smartest, funniest, coolest person I know, but he has a very unhealthy obsession with running for president of the United States. While part of me thinks he could win, he has no qualifications, has never held office, never held a job, never attended college, and rarely leaves his house. He did make several million dollars in his 20s by gambling and investing, which he says he will spend on his campaign if he has to. He says the only thing that motivates him to leave the house is the thought of running for president and making a difference. He is also slightly autistic, though he is definitely high functioning. He was diagnosed with Asperger's as a kid but has told me that is no longer a valid diagnosis. He says he'd like to be a light for other autistic people, which does make me think I could be underestimating him, but I don't know... My heart wants to tell him to try but he's also said he doesn't want to make a fool of himself. The problem is he's good. He knows every politician's name, he knows all this stuff about policy, and he's actually a kind, good man. He's articulate, he's charming, he knows just which words to say, and when he hits his groove I swear his fake speeches are as good as Barack Obama's real ones. He used to have speech problems and was a very shy kid, so he's spent years perfecting his speaking abilities in front of a mirror. When we were teenagers he told me, \"If I can master my biggest weakness, talking to people, I can do anything.\" Well he went from being shy and socially awkward to one of the best speakers I've ever seen. I find him very inspiring, but I'm scared for him. Running for POTUS is no joke. He will turn 35 before the next presidential election, and likes to tell me he would be the youngest person to ever run for president. He also has all these plans he's worked on that may or may not be good ideas. So he is showing every indication he is serious about this. He's talked about it forever and always says he's been planning this for most of his life. But \"A\" struggled with drug addiction for years and also has some mental health problems, although he can be good at hiding it. He is mostly sober now besides a little alcohol/weed, and I am proud of him for that, but running for president still seems crazy. He has had these sort of manic episodes in the past when he's gotten really stressed, and I'm afraid of what might happen if he takes the plunge. I'd love for him to prove the world wrong, but how do I prepare to help him if he goes down in a ball of flames? He has said that not trying will make him feel like a failure. He also admits it will be hard to win, and admits he does not expect to win, but still thinks he might.

If you\u2019re even thinking about going there, or know someone who is, please\u2014**DO NOT.** Here\u2019s why: # 1. They\u2019re Dodging Taxes Like It\u2019s a Game These guys are straight-up **scamming the system**. They\u2019ve got all sorts of tricks to avoid paying taxes\u2014fake invoices, cash payments to dodge GST, and even fudging their books to make it look like they aren\u2019t making money. They\u2019re literally **breaking the law** to save a buck. It\u2019s disgusting. # 2. Employees Are Getting Ripped Off And it\u2019s not just the government they\u2019re screwing over\u2014they\u2019re **totally screwing over their employees** too. They play around with salaries to avoid giving people their rightful Provident Fund (PF) and don\u2019t even bother registering employees for Employee State Insurance (ESI). People are getting paid in cash with no records, no benefits, and no protections. It\u2019s a mess. # 3. Patients Are at Risk Here If you care about your mental health, **stay far away** from Athena. They\u2019re not even **properly licensed** to provide care, and they\u2019re handing out meds without proper documentation or supervision by licensed professionals. They\u2019re also faking insurance claims, so it\u2019s not just bad\u2014it\u2019s **dangerous**. # 4. They Don\u2019t Even Follow Basic Health Standards They claim to be accredited, but that\u2019s **complete BS**. They don\u2019t meet any of the necessary standards for running a mental health facility. They don\u2019t have qualified staff, their buildings aren\u2019t up to code, and they don\u2019t even follow basic health and safety rules. They\u2019re lying to everyone, and it\u2019s **unsafe**. # 5. They\u2019re Hiding Money and Financials It gets worse. They\u2019re using **fake shell companies** to hide money and avoid taxes. They\u2019re literally trying to cover up their financial tracks to make sure no one finds out what they\u2019re really doing behind the scenes. This is not just shady\u2014it\u2019s illegal. # 6. They Don\u2019t Care About Patients or Consumers On top of all that, they **ignore** complaints from patients. If you\u2019re overcharged, mistreated, or just want to know what\u2019s going on with your care or billing, **good luck**. They don\u2019t give a damn about their patients or consumers.

I get seriously depressed after watching or playing certain things. Especially if the characters are in distress, and their histories and lives really gets to me. I dream about it, the soundtracks haunt me in weeks or so, and I feel unable to get out of the feelings and the world the show or game created for me. Like I just played through this games about teenagers on the road, a masterpiece with an amazing story and soundtrack, and I can't seem to let it go. I think about the story all the time, the music is in my head night and day, and you know, and almost no matter what I do I can't seem to snap out of it. Like in many shows and games, I had some really rough (but also kind of amazing and free) teenage years - due to the loss of a parent - and for many years I really tried to escape my family and reality in many ways. Now I have house, husband, kids and dogs, and really living a normal boring life. But is that why? Is it some sort escapism through the shows and games because I really want their lives?

I meant, \u201ccan I get some opinions?\u201d When I was a child, I never felt bad for anything bad happening to others and always saw their struggles or having to deal with them as a bother. For example, someone would tell me that they like me or something they want from me and I\u2019d either ignore them or do something to not have to deal with it because it wasn\u2019t what I wanted. Then when I got older, I started feeling shame and guilt for either upsetting people or getting negative reactions from others. This didn\u2019t happen naturally though. The only reason why I would feel either way was because someone told me that\u2019s how I\u2019m supposed to feel when that happens. The main thing that makes me wonder is because of how when I get a negative reaction from someone I change my behavior to not get that reaction even if I have to lie about how I actually feel. I wouldn\u2019t say that this is because I am a people pleaser, but more because I don\u2019t want to have to deal with the negative reactions, because they stop me from getting what I want. I don\u2019t change what I say just to make them feel better or to placate them, I say whatever I have to, to change the negative reaction and convince them in a way that gets a positive reaction. I feel fake because of this and a part of me wants for people to know the real me and accept my opinions and feelings for what they are, but at the same time I have no problem lying about how I feel to not have to deal with the negative reactions. I have no problem lying about everything I have to just so that I don\u2019t have to deal with a negative reaction. I don\u2019t know if this is trauma or if I\u2019m a psychopath because when I didn\u2019t do this, I just would either not talk much or I would have to deal with not being in relationships because my feelings always made my partners feel bad.

I didn\u2019t feel bad about it hurting them, but I didn\u2019t like the result of them not liking me anymore which took away the good feeling that I wanted.

I'm a teenager (16-18; not comfortable saying my actual age), M, in a pretty stressful situation. For years now, my mental health has been declining immensely. I was sexually abused for 2 years between the ages of 9 and 11, and while my abuser is behind bars now, the aftermath of what he did to me practically broke me. I've never been the same. I've developed a couple of disorders over the years such as BPD. My BPD has led me to spiral out and act in ways that I've hated myself for, but I also can't blame my behavior entirely on a disorder. I am not a good person. I'm a sociopath despite also having empathetic traits, I'm a compulsive liar, and something of a narcissist even while I hate my own guts. To make matters worse I'm a shut-in. I have 1 friend irl and we aren't very close. My previous few friendships have ended bitterly, and I rarely leave the house due to my fear of being perceived at all. The only friend I really have (that isn't online) is my mom. And she can never truly understand the depths of what I go through. My mental state has been declining rapidly for months, well, really it's been years, but it's really been noticeable within the last, I'd say nine months. I was in a relationship for about a year, with a girl who I'll call A, but a couple months ago we cut things short. We were fwb for about a week, but that's over now too, because I have continously let A down and shown her that I'm not a good person, unintentionally, but it still happened. She doesn't love me anymore and says she doesn't see herself ever loving me again. I know a lot of you will probably go \"just drop her, she's not that important,\" but that isn't the case for me. I really truly love her and I want to be a better person. I want to be okay again and I'm looking for advice in any form. Please. I'm desperate at this point.", "1jhhm4w": "Why do sometimes I feel like I\u2019m in a video game?

It's been happening less lately and for less time. At its worst I was stuck feeling like this for 5 months and I genuinely thought people had set dialogue and that I may have been a rouge ai and had to pretend that I wasn't sentient either or else I would get hurt (there's a lot more to it and it was way more complicated but i don't know if it's important) It hasn't been that bad in 3 years and I usually feel better in a few days but I still get distressed when my head clears up.

TW: self-harm, sexual assault, suicidal thoughts andmention of eating disorders im 14, I've been struggling with mental issues or at least I think so since I remember. I can't get a diagnose or a therapist cause my parents are really unsupportive and if it came out to be anything more than like depression they'd probably call me crazy and disown me the moment I turn 18. I really have no other options nor anyone to help. Before ppl start answering that it's just hormones; I WISH. I've been self-harming for 3 years now, stuck in an eating disorder for 2+ years, tried to commit suicide 2 times now, don't think hormones could cause all that 100%. I have no idea what could've caused any of these, it's like they just appeared there at some point, the only BAD thing that's ever happened to me is getting SA'd by a mentally disabled classmate like a year ago but my problems started WAYYY before that so it could've only made it a little worse. Despite what I said about my parents at the beginning they're not THAT bad. My mom was rather present during my childhood, my father wasn't completely absent either, I'd call it an average trad family. I don't have any childhood trauma that I can remember, yeah I got spanked occasionally but so have most of my peers so I don't think it caused any long-term issues. I already wrote most of the things I struggle with but the biggest problem (I think) are my intrusive thoughts (or at least I think that's what they are). I have thoughts of unspeakable things multiple times on a daily basis. Including stuff I shouldn't name here. And the worst thing is that they aren't just there, I'm ashamed to admit but more than often I find myself drilling into them. I know it's disgusting but I just can't stop. I'm even more scared considering the fact that I have VERY little self-control and literally anything triggers me. I go from 0-100 in seconds and there's nothing I can do about it. Someone annoys me a tiny little bit? I'm gonna hate their guts till I forget why I even hate them and bang my head against a wall out of frustration that I can't hurt them in any way because I'm literally a bag of bones. Sometimes I think that this and consequences are the only things holding me back from acting out on others instead of myself. Another thing is that I noticed is that I don't feel empathy the same way others do and no I'm not trying to be edgy here. I know what's wrong and I know why but it's like I just KNOW it and don't FEEL it. If that can be any relevant, no I don't have any friends, no I don't have anyone I can talk to. I've been isolating myself for 2+ years and I'm unable to talk to people causally, usually I end up blocking them after 2 days just because.

This is going to be toooo long, but I am going crazy. For the past few days, I can't stop thinking about death, mortality, and how we are our brains, how we have bodies, how there might be no spirit, no point, no point if you forget and lose everything you've ever had or done. It's insane. I have NEVER felt this way before. I don't believe in the Christian god, but I naturally believe in a higher power - the universe, fate, destiny, that life is like a story, that I will find a soulmate, and always leaning towards reincarnation or something similar. I have always perceived death as a stage, not the END. I have always felt at peace with it, and connected to it somehow. It was FINE. It was GOOD. When I was younger I used to have suicidal thoughts. Maybe not serious ones, never was going to go through with it, but I wasn't afraid to embrace death, it felt like a step in life. When I was even younger I had a few day period of thinking \"this person will die\" looking at anyone, but it wasn't some sort of morbid fear. It should be nothing new. A few months ago I ended up in the hospital for a few days because of a mysterious chest pain, I was sleep deprived, overworked, dehydrated... I had symptoms of a heart attack (no heart issues detected, I got better after being released), I genuinely spent those few days thinking I'd die. I was convinced it was a possibility then. The hospital advised me to get in therapy but I really didn't feel a need for it. But it STILL didn't feel so alien then. I was just upset that I led myself into not having enough time, I was motivated to create, be kind and live even better. I wasn't scared of the after, I just felt that I need more time! I am an artist and I have always believed in souls and meaning. I was happy just to live and I cherish my moments. A few days ago, I woke up very early before a test, and this just popped up in my head, like someone turned a switch. All those thoughts that we are animals, that there is no meaning. I don't even doubt animals have souls, that everything has a soul, I don't know. It's driving me insane. And even when I accepted everything in my head, I realized - this might not be a fear of death at all, I just think I became hyperaware of my consciousness and started losing my sense of identity. I know it's temporary. I get weird anxious thoughts every few months or years that bug me for a few days like this, about anything. But it just feels so bad. It's like stressful derealization. I want to be normal again. I am still a kid. I am not even actively, or rationally, worrying. It's just like something in the back of my head. A fear of fear. A fear of fearing this for any longer. This is the first time in my life I feel like it's something that is challenging to get through by myself, for the first time I feel like I need therapy or medication. Usually I can distance myself from any trouble by engaging with something else and can bend my mind to my will with ease. I spent the whole weekend, depressed, scrolling through TikTok (I haven't touched it for a year) in my bed, trying to remember how to LIVE again through the nonsense I watch. I feel like a ghost, jealous of other people for being alive, as if I am the only person aware of death. As if I forgot how to live without thinking about this 24/7. I even woke up in the middle of the night, the thoughts in my subconscious before I could even think of them myself. Normally, I feel bad wasting any time doing \"nothing\" or consuming content instead of creating. This weekend, I have no regrets, I just want it to stop. It's not even a conscious fear at this point, it's like I unlocked something. I immediately feel better and distanced from those thoughts after writing it down, but I think it's a very brief addiction to reassurance. I want to be stressed about life. The feeling is like... disgust.

Recently in the past 5 years I also been suffering from horrible disturbing intrusive thoughts and images \ud83d\udc94 I was on sertraline for a few years , slowly came off it as I was going well but recently I have a relapse of anxiety and depression and I have started sertlaine again. Recently leading up to the relapse I have had issues with audio hallucinations , they all relate to the intrusive thoughts. IMPORTANT I know they are not real or true at all. I don't have paranoia or any delusions or think it actually happened . They really distress me when they happen because I know these things didn't happen. When I spoke to the doctors they said this was due to high anxiety , low depression and high stress etc causing this to happen to me. Since starting the Sertaline( 1 week) I have been experiencing insomnia( sleep is currently 4 to 5 hours) high anxiety still and the audio hallucinations are starting to concern me. Here is what I have been experiencing. -Hearing a certain intruisve thought in my head through audio around me , for example listening to radio and I hear the intrusive thought in the music or -Having sudden intrusive images of things happening in front of me when I know it didn't actually happen . -Whispered intrusive thoughts in my head . -Sat next to someone and then hearing a intruisve though in their voice like \"M your a bad person\" Also I have had some horrid intrusive thoughts when I lie down to go to sleep. I don't hear these in voices. \"Hello M we're the voices in your head \" \"Hello M your a bad person like me \" I KNOW THESE THINGS DIDNT ACTUALLY HAPPEN OR ARE REAL AT ALL . THEY REALLY DISTRESS ME WHEN THEY HAPPEN AND IM GETTING WORRIED. My mind keeps telling me I am going insane/crazy and keeps talking about psychosis and other things. I'm getting concerned now as I want these things to stop as they are distressing me and scaring me frankly. No assholes or trolls please!

This ultimately was triggered by me trying to recall when I got off my Prozac last year and when I couldn't remember the specifics, I had a full blown panic attack (roughly 3 weeks ago). I was on 30 MG Prozac for 3 years to treat a similar rumination pattern that was diagnosed as GAD and DPDR.

I decided to test out some different pressures of my hand and fingers on the page, and most of them resulted in me having some residual ink on my hand. This means that even though I take great pains to make sure that my last writing and manipulation of ink is when I write with a pen in the notebook, likely many, many, many, many times I have had the ruled line ink on my hands that I then washed off (or maybe sometimes it even stayed for a while), totally without realizing it. That means I completely violated my rules. This is not a good thing. It's not \"Oh, I did something wrong and nothing bad happened.\" That isn't how my mind works. I'm facing the concept that tons of stuff I did after writing was really invalid because I hadn't written correctly (the writing being a gateway to be able to do other stuff). I cannot BELIEVE that I never realized that the ink of the lines could smudge onto my hand. I never really even thought of it. The only bright spot is that from my preliminary trials, a notebook brand that I primarily used for years has lines that are fainter and may not yield ink up so easily as different brands I have used only for the last two years that have lines that are more prominent.

I\u2019d get what I\u2019d called depressive episodes where I feel so paralysed with sadness? I become very withdrawn from others and im unable to do any of my schooling or even the basics of taking care of myself. these episodes can last weeks or even to a month which was my longest.

Hello, I (34M) recently decided that I needed to start working on being healthier and lose some weight. Based on professional Medical assessments I need to lose almost 200 pounds. I also have been diagnosed with ADHD, Depression, and Anxiety. Personally I love to cook and try new recipes I love to make and eat super delicious food. I love cooking so much that I make 90% of the meals for my household. Now I may be totally off base here, but I think a big part of my overeating problem stems from the dopamine I get from eating tasty food. Once I really started tracking what I've been eating I noticed I used to eat/snack almost constantly. Now I am trying really hard to reduce my calorie intake because I have almost no time for exercise so the entire calorie deficit has to be diet based. So that means I eat less tasty food, less frequently, and in lower amounts. Which so far does seem to be helping me shed some weight. (13 pounds in 3 weeks) But my side affect is that I feel like I'm spiraling. Even on great days I feel so down. I have seen/heard that ADHD can cause problems with our dopamine reception. Maybe that's totally wrong and if so please correct me. But it seems like I just can't seem to stop spiraling ever since I started eating less. I feel like I have to lose the weight because it's dangerous to my health to be so heavy, but I also feel like if I can't stop this spiral it will also be dangerous. So friends what do I do now? Any tips or tricks that you may have found to help? TLDR: I'm afraid that I was getting all my dopamine from overeating. Now that I'm not overeating I feel like mentally I'm spiraling.", "1jh3h36": "My mental health makes work hard (a vent) I am having a really tough time.

I have frequent negative and delusion thinking that I know doesn\u2019t make any sense but in the moment it\u2019s terrifying. Just for example, my brain convinced me last night that the floor was not real, I was in a movie, my family wasn\u2019t real, and the world was ending. I felt like I was sinking into the ground below me and I couldn\u2019t understand how the world could be real. I felt like I was in like an apocalypse. My pretty frequent anxiety attack is my brain will constantly tell me I\u2019m going to throw up as I am emetophobic. This happens everyday, multiple times a day. Sometimes it will last all day, sometimes it comes and goes. I have never had a day without it, though. I have had addiction problems in the past so I really don\u2019t wish to be on any type of sedative like xanax. I take effexor, clondine for sleeping, and buspirone from time to time. They are helpful. I rarely have panic attacks but I would say that the anxiety attacks are worse for me. It\u2019s also hard because it\u2019s mainly just my thinking that causes it and no medication can make me stop thinking. I try to be around friends and family, but my brain tells me they aren\u2019t real and also I don\u2019t like stressing others. I had a boyfriend who used to scream at me and physically attack me for crying or having panic attacks so it\u2019s really hard to talk to others about it. I try to fill my mind with something else like coloring or playing a game but it\u2019s really hard when your brain is telling you that you are actively dying and you start having those classic symptoms like dizziness, nausea, and heart palpations. It\u2019s like I have a parasite in my brain that is constantly telling me things that I know aren\u2019t true and that make no sense. I feel like sometimes I\u2019m going into psychosis like I\u2019m losing reality. I know that isn\u2019t true. I have severe PTSD so not feeling like I\u2019m in reality has been half my life, but it never gets less terrifying somehow. I\u2019m not depressed but I feel so stuck in this that I would rather die than feel like this for the rest of my life. For the first time, I want to live and do better but, it feels like my brain doesn\u2019t want me to. I want to go to therapy so bad, but I live in a small town with every counseling or therapy office around on a 6 month-1 year waiting list or they just aren\u2019t taking new patients. Is there any advice or tips that have helped you? Honestly even if you don\u2019t have any advice, just telling me you understand would be helpful. I feel so alone. I\u2019ve never met or seen anybody with anxiety as bad as mine.", "1jhmhon": "My experience with severe anxiety. Hi all, I thought I would share my experience as a 16 year old girl with diagnosed GAD (generalised anxiety disorder) and PD (panic disorder). I understand how intense and traumatic it can be to live in such a state of mind, and how often it\u2019s underestimated. I hope this brings comfort to anyone going through anxiety, and that it gives those blessed with mental stability an idea of how debilitating it can be for someone with mental health problems. It all started when I was around 8-9, I remember I would often have episodes of derealisation. For those who don\u2019t know what it is, it\u2019s essentially when your brain clocks out, everything feels like a dream; a haze, fight or flight mode, an out of body experience. If you smoke weed or drink alcohol, you can grasp the idea of derealisation. I would have quite severe episodes of derealisation, it literally felt like I did ketamine at times, and that was one of the symptoms of my anxiety. Another symptom I had was that I was delusional, that something out of the ordinary was a bad omen. Here\u2019s an example: I once walked into the kitchen and spotted a cloth with blood on it, a normal person would think nothing of it, I mean, it\u2019s a kitchen lol. My delusional self thought it was a sign of death, I immediately had a panic attack, I couldn\u2019t breathe, I felt pumped full of drugs, I remember begging to be taken to hospital whilst everyone laughed at me, genuinely felt like I was in a horror movie. So you can imagine how bad my anxiety was, panic attacks, derealisation, and delusion. Now due to other issues I was put on antipsychotics and muscle relaxers at the age of 10 which put my anxiety to rest. From then on my anxiety was put to rest, I still knew I had it but it was much more manageable, until the summer of 2024. I\u2019m not sure what triggered it, stress, maybe the fact I hadn\u2019t taken my meds for years, I have no clue. All I remember is that I first started to hyper fixate on my skin, I would search for bumps, or any weird spots. There ended up being red blotch on my skin which triggered an obsession with skin cancer. Weeks later I had an ear infection, the words \u201csepsis\u201d and \u201cbrain infection\u201d flooded my mind. I saw a girl on TikTok with a fatal motor neuron disease known as \u201cALS\u201d, and I immediately started fixating on my hand grip and symptoms associated with said disease. Weeks passed and it became worse, I experienced fatigue, I had become more anxious, and had to sleep with my mum at times. But nothing could\u2019ve prepared me for what happened a few months later. After summer ended, I moved to a new home, and that\u2019s when shit started going down. I was petrified of cancer, I had panic attacks every night, EXTREME derealisation, brain fog, tension headaches, and just a complete change of mental state. The worst part is that this went on for a month before it got unbearable, I genuinely thought this was as bad as it could get, but boy was I wrong. 9:30pm, early/mid October, I suddenly had a panic attack that lasted 5 hours. All I can remember is that my brain didn\u2019t feel right, that I thought I was having a psychotic break, that I was going to die. I spent hours rocking back and forth in my mums bed as she took care of me, it was so horrific. The next day I was completely bed bound, I didn\u2019t sleep the whole night. For the next 3 weeks I would have 2-3 panic attacks a day, I would have the most intense physical and mental symptoms. This included: Physical \u2022 Vomiting \u2022 diarrhoea \u2022 trembling \u2022 constant urination \u2022 chest pains \u2022 abdominal pain \u2022 blurry vision \u2022 headaches \u2022 muscle tension Mental \u2022 Hallucinations (visual, sensual, and taste) \u2022 Impending doom \u2022 panic attacks \u2022 delusion \u2022 brain fog \u2022 memory loss \u2022 general depression + SO MUCH MORE. I could go on and on about how horrible my experiences were, this is just the tip of the iceberg. But I figured it\u2019s getting too long and the idea of this was to be of reassurance. If you are struggling with something like this, just know that anxiety can present itself in such severe forms, it\u2019s not a silly, teenage girl illness, any severe mental illness is bound to severely affect someone. With that being said, there is hope. I spent 5 months in such a horrific state, some have managed to survive YEARS. I\u2019m not there yet, but I\u2019ve gotten better, Zoloft has really helped me, as well as support from my family and friends, and obviously reading similar experiences on Reddit. I promise things get better, and once it does those awful experiences will be buried.

So I have the type of anxiety where my stomach will start hurting and the urge to go to the bathroom is like crazy. I've been to gastrologists, I've been to two different therapists, and I've told my doctor. I was told it was probably IBS, after they tried all the tests they could including colonscopy and endoscopy, but they havent officially diagnosed me and the medication they give me doesn't work. Fiber doesnt work. Nothing is helping me with these panic attacks I get. Because I don't panic until I feel that urge to go. The cramping of my stomach and the diarrhea that needs to urgently come out. I've tried breathing, which works 1 in 10 times, and I've tried the 5 senses rule. I've tried talking to keep myself occupied. Nothing works. I feel like Im going to explode from the inside. I have to exhale dramatically sometimes because it gets too much. I need a bathroom and sometimes it's not always there which freaks me out even more. I immediately go walking because I can't just stand still and sitting makes it worse. It's 50/50 chance that when I do reach a bathroom, I will use it. Panic doesn't go away when I do unless it's alot. If I don't use it, it won't leave me alone until I reached my destination or I'm home. I spend about an hour everyday on the toilet because it does eventually come out if I have something there and if nothing comes out, it reassures me that I'm empty. But if it's too early, like 3 am to 7 am, I am not reassured at all. It's too early to have a bowel movement and spending an hour on the toilet won't work in those hours. I have woken at 5 once, spent a very long time waiting on the toilet but nothing came out, went outside, and as soon as I stopped at a bus stop my stomach was hurting and I had to use it really bad. I panicked and walked back and forward because moving helps me but it wouldn't go away so I ended up breaking down. I spent an hour and 20 minutes in agony of stomach pain, the urge to use the bathroom, and the feeling of needing to breathe more until I eventually got up and went back home. As soon as I got home and went on the toilet, absolutely nothing came out. It happens if it's too early in the morning. I say 95% of the time it happens if I'm outside before 10 am. The remaining time is if I eat alot or I eat something spicy or greasy and I go outside immediately after. It always happens when I'm outside or when I'm home and someone's in the bathroom at the moment. It is ruining my life, I have so many events that require me to be early. I hate letting everyone down. I tried dieting in January. I thought it worked but just 2 days ago I had an attack again and I started crying. I had the urge to run and I was just nearly seconds away from screaming at the bus driver to let me off. It didn't go away even when I arrived at my doctors appointment at 9:30 am. Stomach kept cramping and I kept running to use the bathroom but I was still nervous because I couldn't spend my time in there because patients would need it for urine samples. So I know the reason behind them. I'm terrified of soiling myself. The humiliation, shame, and the stares would be horrifying. It'll never leave me alone. And I hate when people tell me to just let it happen. It won't make it all go away. I am seriously considering adult diapers. At 23 years old. I'll add somethings that might or might not be relevant: I used to be terrified of toilets growing up. I would soil myself at home because of how scared I was. I would also have many bowel movements that were hard as stone and huge. I was told it was because I didn't drink enough water. I have some aunts and a grandparent with issues of panic attacks. None of them have the urge to use the bathroom though. This all started from food poisoning when I was 19. I ate everything my siblings ate except for this Dunkin Donuts Coffee. I believe that's what made me sick because I spent an entire week in agony with urges to go and stomach pain. I went to a doctor and I forgot what he told me but I recieved no help.

I think this is what might have started my anxiety problem. From then on, I understood that not everyone comes back when they leave, and the uncertainty of it all made me crack. But that\u2019s not what I wanted to talk about. My family keeps stray cats. We always have, I\u2019m used to it all but the important thing here is that my dad and stepmom believe that cats should be able to go outside and roam. And before you say anything I\u2019ve had many many fights and talks about it with them and they are pretty stubborn on it. With that you might imagine I\u2019ve lost many cats. And I loved each one of them. Each one was a friend, and a hope that this time they\u2019ll stay with me, only for them to go missing, or drown, or get hit by a car. The longest I\u2019ve had a cat was probably something close to 3 years. And that hurt. Anyways, because of this I\u2019ve started subconsciously linking cats to death.

But as I was waiting something happened with some car in the other line and he looked to be stuck, then I started to panic because what if my car gets trapped in the car wash. It was my time to go, I had cars behind me, I paid and I just couldn't do it. So I got out of my car and asked the car behind me if I they could back up and let me leave as I was having a panic attack and that they could have my paid car wash is they wanted. Turns out it was a mother and her teenage son and immediately this mom is like \"would you like me to go in the car wash with you if that would make you feel better?\" and as I was holding up the line I said sure and so she had her son drive her car and she hopped in my tiny two seater miata, and just sat and talked to me while I drove through the car wash. We just talked about Christmas and she was telling me how she had to sell her house and how her son liked my car and I'm just sitting there shaking like a leaf. And soon enough the car wash was over, we survived, my car didn't break down, and I dropped her back off with her son. One of the most wholesome experiences of my life.

A stigma that I\u2019ve noticed in the mental health community... so many people are happy to talk about it and embrace your differences, but oh no.. don\u2019t have a panic attack in front of them, don\u2019t seek re-assurance from today\u2019s anxious thoughts and jitters. This is something that needs changing. It is more than ok for someone with diabetes to be comforted even when their their blood sugar gets too low and it affects their work.

I\u2019ve never been the same since that day. So, this is a really hard topic to talk about for me. It\u2019s been several years, about 6, and while I\u2019ll forget about what happened, the generalized anxiety it brought still never goes away. First off for context, I\u2019m just gonna show who the serial killer was. It was a pretty big story in my state and really big on YouTube if you spent any time on there in 2012. [Mr. Anime]( Anyways, I woke up today with a comment from a video on YouTube that I posted on. It was a web documentary that someone did on him, and I thought it was a nice way to get some of this off my chest. Of course, this really didn\u2019t help, and I ended up super anxious. People taunting me about it and all sorts of troll behavior you get in YouTube comments. A little backstory: I grew up with Trey from the age of 12 until he killed his family when I was 22. I had been in contact and hung out with him up until like 3 months before he did the act. He cut contact with me around then which I\u2019m pretty sure he either didn\u2019t want to subject me to that or something. When I say we were best friends, I mean we were BEST friends. I spent the night at his house 3 times a week. We had all night WoW gaming sessions, his mom would cook us lunch and dinner so we didn\u2019t even have to stop raiding. His family was so good to me, they were basically a second family. I was in his first ever YouTube video, and I continued making shorts and sketches with him, and even helped with a couple of his anime reviews when he specialized his channel. When he moved to his grandparents house in Hempstead, I visited often, and we made it kind of a party house. He filled his cabinets with liquor and he loved playing the host whenever I came back from college to visit. We definitely indulged in pot and prescription meds, but we were young and stupid. I didn\u2019t do drugs outside of our weekend chill sessions, and I didn\u2019t realize he had been addicted to those and alcohol. The thing about Trey is he always was pretty secretive. If I ever asked him much about his life or his relationship with his parents, he\u2019d try to change the subject. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I knew a lot about him, more than his other friends, but it took a lot of work by me to get him to open up. Many a night smoking weed and me opening up about my feelings before he finally did about his dissatisfaction with life, his lack of a higher education, and his fathers disappointment in him. I would always try to cheer him up and make him feel better and it seemed to work. When the murders happened, I didn\u2019t even know what to do. My girlfriend at the time comforted me, but I was just...numb. I literally didn\u2019t feel anything. Then, my roommate at the time was like \u201coh let\u2019s smoke a bowl that\u2019ll cheer you up!\u201d And that was when I had my first panic attack. I\u2019m talking full on \u201cI\u2019m gonna die oh my god.\u201d This went on for nearly 2 days. Constantly pacing and checking my heart rate. I couldn\u2019t sleep or eat and felt like I was going insane. I actually packed up and drove to Dallas (I lived in Austin) to go to my moms because I didn\u2019t know what to do, and she had a Xanax prescription and gave me one and I slept for nearly 20 hours. I\u2019ve struggled with anxiety for years now. I learned it\u2019s caused by PTSD from the events. I have no health insurance so I can\u2019t really go to therapy unless I foot the entire bill so it really sucks, this is my only way to talk about it honestly other than friends who don\u2019t really understand. No one really understands. My dad thinks I should just get over it, shit happens, but he\u2019s never had his fucking best friend kill his second family! A family that was honestly nicer than his real family, who treated him with love and respect and not judgement. Anyways, sorry for the erratic writing or if it jumps around a lot. I\u2019m kind of in a panicked mindset because I got triggered by all the memories of Trey. It\u2019s hard for me to organize my thoughts when I get into this mindset. It feels like I can\u2019t focus on any thought and my mind is just swimming and it leaves me confused. If anyone has any questions I\u2019d love to answer, but I\u2019d also love some advice and support. Thanks for reading. Edit; Everyone that responded thank you so so much. You have no idea how much this means to me. I\u2019m in this weird place between joy and guilt that this got so many comments. Joy because I realized people care so much about a random person, and guilt because I feel I don\u2019t deserve that compassion. Yes I know that\u2019s stupid but that comes with the anxiety sadly. Like others have said, I feel I may have a bit of survivors guilt because I learned I was actually a target of his, and I read and article by someone yesterday where he did an interview with Texas rangers. Supposedly when he was 13 he was considering killing one of his friends. I know that friend was me. I remember that day because we were playing with guns as country kids will do and I remember him aiming in my general direction but kind of doing a \u201chaha I got you\u201d thing that he loved doing. Anyways, I\u2019m trying to respond to everyone, but I work 11am-11pm the next 2 days (yay service industry). So if I haven\u2019t responded yet, I will definitely try.

There\u2019s a celebrity I\u2019ve been obsessed with for a long time. At first, it was admiration, but over time, it became something more unhealthy. I constantly search for his name online, check comments about him, and get extremely anxious when I see negative opinions. It feels like my entire mood depends on how people talk about him. Even when I try to stop, I find myself going back, not even out of fear or excitement anymore, but just out of habit. I deleted apps from my phone, but I still find ways to search from my laptop. It\u2019s like my brain is wired to keep doing it, even though I know it brings me nothing but stress. It\u2019s not just the searching\u2014I also daydream about him a lot, sometimes for hours.

The paranoia really only hits when I\u2019m in a depressive episode, its not necessarily my constant state of being.

Hey folks, So, im very open about the fact I struggle with treatment resistant depression, PTSD, BPD, and ADHD. I have tried every antidepressant (first generation, SSRIs, SNRIs, atypical/off-label), typical and atypical antipsychotics, and some mood stabilizers as well as cognitive behavioural therapy, dialectical behaviour therapy, cognitive processing therapy, EMDR, emotion focused therapy, existential/eclectic/psychodynamic therapy, internal family systems therapy, and somatic/hypnotic therapy. I have even tried third-line depression options like IV ketamine therapy and unilateral (one side/temple) ECT (electroconvulsive therapy). Right now im being recommended ECT again, however it would be bilateral (both sides/temples) this time, which tends to be a lot more effective but also have a lot more side effects. *side note: to those who aren\u2019t aware, yes, ECT is still something performed today. It is nothing like it used to be back in the 60s or how it\u2019s shown in the movies. You get put to sleep, given a paralytic so you don\u2019t experience muscle contractions, and then a low electric current is passed through your brain to trigger a controlled, therapeutic seizure. You do not experience any pain other than possibly a headache and the entire procedure + anesthesia lasts maybe ten minutes. It is a very safe procedure* The active phase of the procedure is getting ECT three times a week Monday, Wednesday, and Friday for a minimum of four weeks. Once the active phase is completed you move on to the weekly maintenance phase and slowly decrease the frequency of treatment. Anyway, the efficacy for this treatment is 60%-80%, which compared to other treatments for mental disorders is considered very high. I only noticed mild benefit with unilateral ECT (this is often the case, most people end up needing bilateral ECT but they try the unilateral first for those who only end up needing that one side for full benefit and that way reduce the possibility and intensity of side effects). I\u2019d also like to reiterate just how much \u201cthis is my last option\u201d. I have tried everything, I mean literally everything that can be tried for depression AND then some. However, the side effects of bilateral ECT can be pretty intense. I was lucky to only experience headaches when I did unilateral but I was promised I would not be so lucky with bilateral. The biggest, most common, most intense symptom is memory loss. It can be pretty severe, lots of people report having blackouts where they lose memory of several hours of the day and just randomly \u201cgain consciousness\u201d in the middle of nowhere or performing a random activity hours later. You experience significant cognitive decline (like they make you do typical Alzheimer\u2019s diagnostic tests to monitor the rate of your decline). The bright side is that permanent memory loss and cognitive decline is uncommon, it usually only lasts during the active phase of your treatment and maybe early into your maintenance phase too.

I have been diagnosed with both anxiety and depression in the past, so I take Wellbutrin daily. My concern is somewhat...strange(?) because I don't know what this is tied to. Everyday I HAVE to change my phone around. So, wallpaper, app placement, light/dark mode. I delete and install apps, even reinstall ones I've deleted. I haven't gone a single day without doing so, in years. ***I'm always beating myself up or in distress over something. Things that I don't even know why they're stressing me to the point of tears.*** Lately, its the fact that I don't know Chinese or can't get myself to enjoy studying it (note: *I am NOT Asian.* I'm Latina, but have always enjoyed Asian media and culture. I had like a month and a half in the beginning of 2024 that I enjoyed learning simplified Chinese). So now, anytime I try to watch a Chinese drama or listen to an OST, I force myself to stop because the thoughts of NEEDING to know the language are too overwhelming. I end up going on my phone and forcing myself to study until I'm exhausted and can't stand it. Literally have had no fun learning it these past two weeks but when I stop I get so distressed-- same thing happens when I do try though, its a daily tug-of-war. This happened with Korean-- when was OBSESSED with k-pop, Japanese--anime, manga, japanese baseball, Russian--literally liked ONE Russian character and enjoyed watching figure skating, etc. Then I start thinking about people who are learning it, who are capable of reading it, and how they're SO much better than me and the cycle repeats. I stop learning and listen to a song and the need begins again. I don't know if this is because of a self-worth issue, or because of my innate interest in Asia since I was younger? But I'm losing it daily. I delete my language learning app, reinstall, repeat. Guilt arises, I reinstall. Stress and unhappiness over the forced learning, delete. I see someone else learning it? Reinstall. Etc. It doesn't help when I see people say that simply knowing Spanish as a second language isn't as good anymore (as it's my second lang that I'm fluent in), so I start getting insecure...it never ends. On top of this, I tend to learn pronunciation in other languages relatively...easily? So I think about having potential at learning it and stress about NOT learning it because I want to prove that I'm capable? I can't draw without feeling guilty. I can't keep learning ASL because my brain goes to the other language. I can't play a game without feeling like a waste of time. I can't listen to my usual music since I feel like I'm just \"going backwards\" instead of improving(?) -- so I guess, listening to Chinese music to enhance immersion would be going \"forward\" in this point of time for me. I feel like I'm obsessed with self-improvement/productivity or something because I overanalyze everything I do now and feel bad if I don't think it'll give me huge benefits in the future. When the year STARTED, my stress was about my sexuality out of nowhere. I'm telling you, the second I woke up on Jan 1st. I don't know where it came from, but it was a 24/7 stressor. To the point where it was all I watched on YouTube or looked up online. After that subsided around mid Feb, this began. I'm so mentally exhausted and feel so strange because idk why I am like this.

Say get up to make food at 6:00, and if i dont get up at exactly 6:00, then i have to wait for 6:30. Sometimes on bad days if i miss my original time then i cant get up until im starving and shaking from it and Need to eat. A less extreme version of that is that if im getting up to do something, it has to be when the clock is at :00, :15, :30, or :45, or else i cant get up. Another example is laundry day, but if i dont do laundry that day, then my brain says that i Cant do it until next saturday or up until I Absolutely Have To because i have no clothes for the next day. I dont know whats stopping me but i feel like im somewhat paralyzed or forbidden from doing whatever it is unless its a specific time/day. Unless i have permission. Permission/direction from someone overrides everything and i can immediately go and do it no matter what time or day but unless i ask for it, it doesnt happen. Often times i just struggle until i absolutely have to do something because there is no option to Not do it. And often times my fragile schedule will fall apart afterwords.

I have one trait that has been with me absolutely all my life (this is important to keep in mind, as some people may mistake my personality trait as a consequence of something having happened to me at some point in my life). I don't feel empathy towards real people I might meet in life, for example. For the most part, I don't understand the emotions they feel, or I myself don't feel compassion if they have something going on (even if it's someone in my family), but that doesn't mean I hate them. I just can't, I don't know how to force myself to be different. Even though there were more negative moments, I can't really talk about it, but I remember not feeling anything for any people since I was a kid. There wasn't some event that made me this way, it just is, and always has been. But for all that, I am capable of experiencing very deep feelings similar to empathy for inanimate objects and animals. For example, I would be heartbroken if I saw someone stepping on a flower or hurting an animal. When I see something like that, most of the time I start crying and run away somewhere just to avoid seeing it. I also have a hard time getting rid of unwanted items because I feel like I'm betraying them and they are forever alone. Also, on top of that, I can feel something similar about characters when I watch movies, even though they are people. I can't say I understand all the emotions they feel, but I get hurt when my favorite character dies or something bad happens to them. I probably see characters from movies more as \"inanimate\" since with real people in real life I do lack empathy. No doubt I have some very horrible thoughts and ideas, and I also believe in a lot of things that are morally \"wrong\", but I don't see the point in talking about them now.

Lately, I have been having very explosive anger outbursts over small things and in result I have been hyperventilating, scratching myself until I bleed, and disassociating heavily. I always have a strong urge to do something big like rip out my hair or punch a hole in my wall or throw my phone at concrete and to cope with these feelings I\u2019ve just been scratching my skin. As an example, today I was watching tv in my living room and my mom came home and turned off the fan that I had on. (She has issues with fans and doesn\u2019t like the way they feel). I got very upset because it was hot in the living room, and I asked her if we could come to a compromise, to which she absolutely refused. It made me super upset for some reason and I felt like the only thing I could do was leave the room before I said or did something I would regret. I had already started crying (for some reason?) before I left the room, and when I did leave the room, my dad said \u201cperfect timing\u201d(meaning now he could take over the tv for himself since I was leaving) and it just made me feel so embarrassed and defeated. I left to my room and hyperventilated/sobbed while throwing things and being incredibly destructive for a good 45 minutes before I decided to take a bath. I was still crying and sobbing heavily when I got into the bath and then I really started scratching my arms. Both arms are now really scratched up and I just feel really stupid for over reacting so terribly. During all of this, I felt out of my body. It felt like my mind would be running with thoughts but I couldn\u2019t control my body or I felt like I was someone else. Along with this, I feel like I am slowly losing my sense of self.
