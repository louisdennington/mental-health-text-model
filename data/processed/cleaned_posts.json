I never really understood it because i too would be sad if a friend or family passed away but what if I wasnt a significant presence in anyones life? why cant i apply to be euthanised in a controlled environment and then donate all my organs to someone who actually wants to live. why wouldnt that be a win win scenario?"

Every nude I‚Äôve ever sent has NOT included my face, because I know the consequences. My account also did not include my full name. But a girl on Snapchat with a very high Snapscore (making it more believable) was asking for a VERY explicit video of my full body with my face included. I was very hesitant to send it, but in the end she convinced me to and I did. It went down exactly how I feared it would, she saved the video and blocked me. They didn‚Äôt threaten me or blackmail me, they just simply blocked me. I‚Äôm hoping it was just a pervert who collects these kind of videos and does nothing else with them. Now there‚Äôs an extremely explicit video with my full body and face in it on someone else‚Äôs phone. They don‚Äôt have my full name, BUT I‚Äôm scared the video will be posted and eventually traced back to me as my face is online I‚Äôve tried StopNCII and everything, and I hope nothing comes of this and the video doesn‚Äôt go anywhere. All I hope is nothing happens and the feeling eventually goes. I feel extremely anxious."

But for me? It‚Äôs when things start to get a little... off. * **Allergies that ruin everything.** I want to enjoy the fresh air and sunshine, but instead, I‚Äôm stuck sneezing, rubbing my eyes, and feeling like I‚Äôve been hit by a truck. The worst part? It feels like no amount of allergy meds ever fully works. * **Mood swings that hit out of nowhere.** You‚Äôd think more sunlight would boost my mood, but sometimes it‚Äôs the opposite. The pressure to *feel better* just because the weather is nice makes me feel even worse. It‚Äôs like my brain didn‚Äôt get the memo that it‚Äôs supposed to be ‚Äúspringtime happy.‚Äù * **The weird loneliness.** Everyone starts making plans and being more social, and I just... don‚Äôt have the energy. It‚Äôs like the world wakes up, but I‚Äôm still stuck in winter mode, feeling out of sync with everyone else. Does anyone else struggle with this seasonal mismatch?

I wasn‚Äôt ready because I wanted to date around and just not used to someone wanting to love me well right off the bat (and frankly, going after the wrong types). Now he‚Äôs married to someone else and giving her the life I would have had and now, desperately want. So I have imagined all of the reasons for why I made that decision at the time and all of the things I could have had now, and how uninformed and wrong I was. Why I didn‚Äôt have anyone intervene and tell me I was making the wrong decision. How stupid I was to pass that up. Nothing about it is certain, because it‚Äôs not guaranteed, but it feels so painful. Anyway, why does this happen every so often? How can I make it stop from the root?

I started having severe dental issues 3 years ago, I have insurance but nothing is fully covered and somehow I'm supposed to deal with my illness without being able to work, no family no friends and on the verge of homelessness. I thought about you know what but I don't want to not exist anymore. It would be difficult just having my mental illness and severe depression but being in constant pain from something super treatable but I cant afford to fix it is a nightmare, dental issues. I try to talk to ai to get by but I still suffer a lot. This world sucks and I cant believe my family ghosted me both sides, it's like being in the twilight zone Watching my mom suffer and die when I was 9 now I'm 48 planted the seed. When I was in my late 30's they thought I had stomach cancer like my mom this was in 2018 and I had a mental break because of it. I never recovered mentally since then. When people see me walking down the street they think I'm on drugs. I pace back and force and I'm in severe mental distress. Los Angeles will not hospitalize someone with my severe illness, I tried. Intuitions are for the rich. I went to a ER a few years ago and they saw me for my physical problem but refused to treat my mental condition and threatened to forcibly remove me from the hospital when all I did was ask to be seen for my mental illness, this was during Covid. They basically patient dumped me in the middle of the night. This was UCLA. These places that are supposed to help you don't. That's why there's so many homeless here in Los Angeles. I'm lost and I hate my life but I don't want to die. If hell exists it's my life By the way I don't drink, smoke or do any drugs. This is all natural, my brain is overwhelmed and it cant handle everything that's going on right now. I honestly don't see an end in site.

I take Xanax for flights and my whole prescription was empty (I only took 2 pills for a back and forth flight) ... He ate all my sons Ritalin, and Adderall . So I stopped filling them because he would steal them, and even when hid he would always find them. He got so desperate he ate all my pills for a kidney issue I had. He is not accountable and never predictable. He will promise up and down , and a couple weeks go by and he will do a 180. Like hiding conversations or contact with people that help him be delusional about not gettingthe right help.. His last attempt as his own life he was in hospital and instead of getting admitted for that he stayed there for a couple days as a heart patient because he didn't have insurance , he didn't want to go to the psych unit and was admitted for chest pains. His mother and sister attacked me in the hospital elevator blaming me for his attempt (it was his 5th) ... I have no idea what I would have done to cause it. I worked part time, took care of our kids, home and everything that is part of that. He ran a failed business and was rarely home or around and when he was he would sleep. I once found a empty bottle of honey goat weed in his work bathroom which he blamed on his dad but later admitted that it was his however refused to elaborate why. When moving out our last home I found a size 2 very revealing polyester dress I never bought (I'm size 10) mixed with my clothes a gold chain belt, and hoop earrings in his underwear drawer and a winter jacket... none of these were mine. His excuse was the kids brought it in. He chats with women, and just a couple of days ago he received a text from a local number \"how much to f*uck?\" (Are they asking how much he will pay them ?) He of course says he doesn't know what that is about.... I'm just so exhausted. Why is bipolar so hard ? I just know somewhere in there is the real him?"

Every day I think of people that hurt me, I cannot emphasize enough that their names are literally floating in my head every second of every day. When I'm busy, when I'm alone, and now as I'm writing this. I have terrible thoughts about people I love, people that are dear to me, people I would take a bullet for without a second thought. Because of this, I am considering suicide, because I feel such guilt that is getting difficult to live with. I don't know what to do, and when I try to open up about this to my family all I'm met with is, ‚ÄúJesus is the only way.‚Äù this is getting frustrating to hear as I'm an atheist and I'm not changing that.

For most of my life, since around the age of 8 or even younger, I‚Äôve always displayed OCD symptoms. I can‚Äôt remember the exact age, but at one point in my life, I became extremely health-conscious and also terrified of the FBI taking me away from my family. For the health-conscious part, I would think that I had literally any disease‚ÄîI thought I had cancer, brain tumors, etc. Every single day, if I felt something off, I looked up my ‚Äúsymptoms‚Äù and researched the diseases I convinced myself I had. I would constantly have panic attacks, thinking I would die soon, and I was just extremely exhausted. Over time, I gradually stopped, although I still get anxiety when I get sick‚ÄîI think I‚Äôll die every time I do. A small snippet of other things I experienced is that I used to get intrusive sexual thoughts, which made me extremely uncomfortable. It lasted only for a year, but I thought I‚Äôd include it here. During the health-conscious paranoia, I also thought the FBI was after me. I was naive when I was younger and went on some weird websites, which made me think the FBI would come after me. With those thoughts, every single day, I believed the FBI was watching me. For some reason, a lot of helicopters flew over my neighborhood, so I thought they were after me. Every time I saw one, I was terrified for my life. At some point, I even thought my best friend was an FBI agent trying to gather my personal information! Those obsessions stopped after three years. Then, my obsessions shifted to thinking my loved ones would die every day, followed by religious guilt. The fear of my loved ones dying lasted only two years but was definitely a more intense obsession. When my friends didn‚Äôt respond to my messages, I would check every social media account they had just to see if they were active anywhere, making sure they were alive. If they were inactive for 3+ hours, I would be in extreme panic for however long they didn‚Äôt respond. When my parents went to the store, I would think they had died if they took too long or didn‚Äôt answer my texts. The religious obsession didn‚Äôt last long, but every day, I thought I was going to go to hell because I didn‚Äôt fully align with ‚Äúholy‚Äù values, and I‚Äôm not the most religious person. I tried researching whether certain things that don‚Äôt align with Christian values would send me to hell‚Äîwhich some sources said they would! This made me extremely paranoid. I still think about this sometimes, but not as often now. The same goes for my other obsessions; they aren‚Äôt constant anymore. Right now, I don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôm at. Most of the symptoms stopped in December of last year. I feel so empty. I was so close to finally getting therapy, but everything just stopped. I‚Äôm pretty sure this isn‚Äôt an OCD symptom, but I‚Äôll put it here anyway‚ÄîI‚Äôve been fixated on OCD itself. Every day, I think about OCD, and I look up the symptoms every other day. I just can‚Äôt stop thinking about OCD itself. It started around January. I convince myself that I have OCD, but at the same time, I convince myself that I don‚Äôt. So I constantly look up symptoms and talk to ChatGPT about it (which is embarrassing, but it‚Äôs a way I reassure myself) OCD runs on my mom‚Äôs side, and almost everyone has it, I don‚Äôt know if I do but soon I will get the support I need. NOTE: Please do not diagnose me once again, I don‚Äôt want a diagnosis. This is just a post about my suspicion."

About a year later, my mind pushed me to do it again. I went on a casual sex website, talked to someone, no photos, and they came in the early morning, penetrated me, and left. The same thing happened 2-3 more times. I didn‚Äôt enjoy any of these encounters at all. I dissociate, and at the end, when they leave, I feel nauseous and disgusted. Through all of this, I always consented, no one took advantage of me, but it was like I was on autopilot, not caring that I was hating it. I want to stop doing it, I feel terrible, I have no libido with my girlfriend, even though I love her and want to be with her. Recently, I signed up to talk to a sexologist, I feel like I can‚Äôt talk about it with my regular therapist, I don‚Äôt know, I feel a lot of shame and disgust. I had never gone through this before. I don‚Äôt know how it started. It feels compulsive. Is this self-harm? Please help me with what you think."

I 19 (f) have been dating my boyfriend 20 (m) for 4 months now soon will be 5 and it's my first ever proper relationship and I am struggling with my overthinking. The relationship is really healthy, we are both going to the same university (that's where we actually met) and we support one another, help each other and in general helping one another grow as a person. I've been dealing a lot with anxiety especially panic attacks, I'm on medication and this hasn't really been an issue in my relationship at all but I have started to overthink a lot and it's related to my jealousy and fear of losing my bf. The weird thing is that I trust him, I always push him to hang out with his friends, go to parties/clubs, participate in activities, go to his youth meetings, to trips, etc.. I have no issue with this but I'm worried about other girls flirting with him or him checking out other girls when I am not with him which I know he'll never do. I talked to him about this issues and he constantly reassures me and I try my best to ignore these thoughts but I feel like they are getting stronger day by day and it's hard sometimes to make the difference between what's real and what's in my head. If anyone has any tips on how to stop overthinking or cope with these thoughts it would help me out a lot. I feel hopeless and I don't want my consciousness to ruin something beautiful that's currently blossoming in my life."

    "text": "I was told to \"get over\" my mental issues and I listened to them. I think I made everything worse. I've struggled with mental health for my entire life. Went to therapy since I was 18, now I'm 25. Despite trying most of the available medication, nothing worked. Each psychiatrist seemed clueless about what was wrong with me and asked me to figure it out. I have no idea how I was supposed to do that, I'm not the type to read about disorders and self diagnose. One doctor even accused me of faking, saying I wasn't trying hard enough, which convinced me I was lazy and a faker. They really did convince me that I'm even lying to myself. So when I was all alone and still struggling, I told myself I'm just self pitying and ignored the pain. Eventually I just quit therapy and medication, tried to fix myself through exercise and diet. But the horrors in my head never stopped. I had obsessive thoughts, irrational fears, and weird delusions, even tried to fix them with spiritual practices, but nothing worked obviously. I kept it all to myself. I got a job but I rarely slept so I'd fall asleep at work. I froze in front of people, stuttered, and obviously got fired. Then I got an online job, but was fired again due to poor communication skills and \"ai can do it better than you.\" Things have gotten really bad for me. I started smoking and gambling, which would leave me feeling confused later. I'd physically hurt myself after work shifts or stressful interactions, only to numb the pain with shopping. At times, I convinced myself that my spiritual practices were helping, but I always ended up back in pain. Sometimes I come back to reality, try hobbies, making friends or plan my career, but it lasts for no more than 2 days. While I can control smoking or binge eating, I still can't stop spending. These material stuff are the only sources of comfort, happiness and entertainment for me rn. I‚Äôm unemployed again and running out of money, and I don't think I'll ever return to therapy. I know it‚Äôs my fault for getting to this point. The delusions and fears are back again, and I wanted to share this to get it off my chest. Maybe there is something wrong with me, maybe I'm a faker, i don't know, but whatever it is, it feels like it‚Äôs taken over my life, and I‚Äôm not sure how to move forward. I'm filled with so many regrets. People say \"get help,\" I did, where else can I get help if doctors are not willing to help even for money? Some ppl say pray to god, I did and no one heard the prayers. They say get a job, log out, be present, I did but whatever is torturing me is in my head not on the internet. So realistically I ran out of the options."

My partner is feeling it too and it‚Äôs causing a bit of strain between us. ‚Ä¢6 weeks ago I helped a friend by taking on her bearded dragon- he‚Äôs now potentially sick from issues that happened before I got him. I‚Äôve been constantly worrying about him/going to appointments for him. ‚Ä¢I got diagnosed with ADHD last year and am still adjusting to my Ritalin/learning how my brain works and generally just feel chronically over or under stimulated. The therapy/coaching for this is adding to my financial stress but also very needed. ‚Ä¢quitting my main job to take care of my dad (I was a nanny for a family. I loved them but was underpaid/overworked and my dads surgery aligned with three weeks that they went on holidays/I wouldn‚Äôt be payed for so I quit so they‚Äôd be able to find someone in that time) ‚Ä¢applying for a dream job that I feel very under qualified for and have an interview ‚Ä¢I have a trip to Korea coming up that I need to save for ‚Ä¢extreme financial stress from lack of work.

I‚Äôm vaping constantly and feel almost out of body with anxiety. I feel like the combination of wanting/needing this job (it would genuinely be life changing) and the stress I‚Äôm already under is going to make me perform horribly tomorrow and not be able to do an interview I‚Äôm proud of. I‚Äôve almost cried in front of strangers constantly throughout the last week and would just die if I burst into tears mid interview (which is really unlike me).

Overprotection indicates the careful consideration of how to upkeep the relationship. Listening to the other, attempting to co-operate and change to the new relationship. Leads to accomodation, reconfiguration or adaptation of the self. Attachment indicates the increasing reliance on the relationship, emotionally or physically. Getting used to the interactions to a degree that if it's missing, there is a sense of lacking, a void or unfullfillment.

I moved here from India to build a life for myself because I had to provide for my family, and I knew I couldn‚Äôt do that as a 17-year-old in India. But honestly, it feels like a crime. People don‚Äôt want to be friends with someone who has emotional baggage and responsibilities. I‚Äôve tried making friends, building connections, and even dating, but nothing has worked (no surprises there, haha). Friends drifted away, connections faded over time, and dating well, as a brown person with an accent, it‚Äôs difficult here ngl. It‚Äôs not like I had much experience with friends or relationships back in India either. I used to be obese, so I was bullied a lot. But in college here, I finally made a friend. I really liked talking to her, sharing my life with her we had so much in common, and we clicked well. Then, out of nowhere, she ghosted me, and I still can‚Äôt figure out why. After a while, I started dating someone, and I thought it was going well. But then she told me she was in love with someone else. That made me question myself a lot, and I started feeling like I was done with everything. I told myself I should just focus on the role I‚Äôve been given to provide for my family and take care of my younger siblings. I convinced myself that I don‚Äôt need friends or connections. But I guess feelings don‚Äôt work that way. Eventually, I met someone on a ‚Äúmake new friends‚Äù subreddit. We talked, we vibed or at least, I thought so. We had a lot in common, from interests to habits to even similar personalities. We talked every day, asking each other different kinds of questions to get to know one another better. Recently, she told me she was going to leave the country soon to learn about different cultures. Naturally, I asked if she wanted to meet before she left. At first, she made excuses about being too busy. But after I insisted, she finally came clean and said she didn‚Äôt want to meet because she felt we wouldn‚Äôt click in person. I really don‚Äôt understand the point of talking to someone every day, acting like we‚Äôre friends, only to say you never wanted to meet in the first place. I‚Äôm already struggling a lot with my mental health, but this just pushed me over the edge. It feels like being born in a third-world country is a crime, and having family responsibilities and emotional baggage is a sin. I guess I‚Äôm done trying. Maybe this just isn‚Äôt my fate. Maybe I should just be a machine one that doesn‚Äôt feel or think, only works, serves its purpose, and then gets dismantled. I‚Äôm done with social media and the idea of having genuine connections. P.S. I don‚Äôt know if this sounds stupid, but I just needed to get it out because, honestly, my mind and heart can‚Äôt take this anymore."

I posted the other day ( that I had discovered ink on my hand from the blue ruled lines in my notebook that I use for my OCD writing ritual that I have been doing for 30 years in various forms. I decided to test out some different pressures of my hand and fingers on the page, and most of them resulted in me having some residual ink on my hand. This means that even though I take great pains to make sure that my last writing and manipulation of ink is when I write with a pen in the notebook, likely many, many, many, many times I have had the ruled line ink on my hands that I then washed off (or maybe sometimes it even stayed for a while), totally without realizing it. That means I completely violated my rules. This is not a good thing. It's not \"Oh, I did something wrong and nothing bad happened.\" That isn't how my mind works. I'm facing the concept that tons of stuff I did after writing was really invalid because I hadn't written correctly (the writing being a gateway to be able to do other stuff). I cannot BELIEVE that I never realized that the ink of the lines could smudge onto my hand. I never really even thought of it. The only bright spot is that from my preliminary trials, a notebook brand that I primarily used for years has lines that are fainter and may not yield ink up so easily as different brands I have used only for the last two years that have lines that are more prominent. I need to do more tests. That sounds so silly, but that's where I'm at. I'm absolutely spiraling and at a low point. This combined with another huge OCD violation two months ago have dimmed my inner light and sent me further down the hole."

Vyvanse felt like it worked maybe half as well, maybe even worse. Concerta made me feel eerily calm, to the point of almost falling asleep... No energy whatsoever and put me very much \"in my head\" mentally. I didn't want to talk but I felt like I could physically push my mind in the direction of paying attention/doing stuff. Now I'm on Prozac 10mg (for PTSD) and Wellbutrin XL 300mg. The Prozac alone made me feel like I was disconnected from existence. Like the great servers of the brain were no longer firing and though I didn't feel severely emotional, I kind of... Just didn't feel after a month. Nothing but constant low grade depression. Wellbutrin fixed that, but now I have literally 0 interest or motivation. I have considerable more emotional regulation, significantly less rejection sens like symptoms and once \"into\" a task, I can sustain my focus and keep doing it, but I find it very very hard to enjoy doing anything, get started doing anything. I find it very easy to get distracted and have issues processing things the first time etc. **THE QUESTION** at hand is this: anyone with a severe inattentive ADHD profile, how has Modanafil done for you? I'm more curious about motivational aspects and focus. Hell, I'd be glad to just be interested in the *idea* of playing a video game."

    "text": "How to deal with no peace at home? Hey everyone, just for context‚ÄîI'm a 24-year-old guy with diagnosed ADHD, currently working online while living at home with my parents. I‚Äôll probably delete this post soon, as I‚Äôm a bit paranoid about my real identity being tied to it. Lately, I‚Äôve been really struggling mentally. I feel like I‚Äôm hanging on by a thread‚Äîlike I‚Äôm one bad day away from a full-on breakdown. I don‚Äôt enjoy my job. To be blunt, it‚Äôs a toxic environment with cutthroat performance metrics that drain me. It feels like I have to be \"on\" and absolutely perfect from 10:00 to 18:30 every working day. My whole existence feels like it revolves around trying to please people who don‚Äôt even appreciate my work. The worst part? My performance is largely out of my control. I work in tech support, and our ratings depend on customer feedback‚Äîwhich can be completely unpredictable. One bad review can mess up my entire week, or even impact my future in the company. It leaves me feeling powerless. I am in the process of transitioning to a different role, which I think will be a better fit for me, but that won‚Äôt happen for a couple more months. In the meantime, I need to keep performing at a high level while also studying for that new role. These past few months have really been taking a toll on my mental health. Being virtual helps a little, and I try to stay positive and grateful‚Äîbut if I‚Äôm being honest, I feel like I‚Äôm losing it. The biggest strain right now is at home. I just don‚Äôt feel at peace here. It‚Äôs mostly because of my younger brother. I love him, but we recently started exploring the possibility that he may be on the autism spectrum. He‚Äôs 14 and has been very disruptive‚Äîhe makes constant noise, spits everywhere (which really triggers me for some reason), and has loud, aggressive tantrums, though mostly in his room. My parents have finally taken steps to get him assessed, which I‚Äôm grateful for, but it‚Äôs been extremely hard on me. I‚Äôm doing my best to be patient and supportive, but it often feels like he‚Äôs doing it on purpose‚Äîeven though I know he probably isn‚Äôt and is probably stimming. The only peace I get is the couple of hours I spend at the gym or the occasional hangout with a friend. But the moment I return home, I‚Äôm on edge again‚Äînever fully relaxed, always bracing for the next outburst. I don‚Äôt want to spend the next several months‚Äîor even a year‚Äîliving with a constant white noise machine making background noise or needing to wear headphones just to function. Home is supposed to be a place of rest and peace, but instead it‚Äôs a source of anxiety. I‚Äôve been considering working from a co-working space just to escape the chaos, or even commuting to the office (which is a 2-hour round trip), but I know I won‚Äôt be as productive. Feel like I'm always 'on' and can't rest. Still, it‚Äôs becoming harder and harder to stay home. And that‚Äôs what really breaks me‚Äîif I can‚Äôt find peace at work or at home, then where do I go?"

    "text": "Many people greatly undermine the impacts that mental health conditions have on people It's become really egregious to hear and see how people treat those with mental health conditions; I'm getting kind of sick of toxic positivity and the word \"accountability\" being thrown around. Because half the time, it's not even about anything that serious. I'll be a little moody and someone will lecture me about self-improvement. It's funny too, because it's usually the ones who are least qualified to speak on other people's behaviors. Had this experience with a family member recently; who'd dump all of their problems onto me constantly and lash out when they was upset, then if I even got the slightest bit in the dumps or be pessimist, I'd get comments like \"you're feeling sorry for yourself\" and \"you need to have more will power\" I genuinely don't know where people got this idea that everyone can magically will their way out of a varying degree of psychological ailments. That everybody should inherently be able to cope the same way, that they have the same environment, resources, peers, etc to deal with the problem, in healthy manners. That's not how life works and it doesn't make that person weak or lazy or unwilling to try. Mental illnesses impact and impair your emotional regulation, perception of self/others/reality, your self-esteem, your self-awareness, your stress tolerance, your own personality. So yeah, there's plenty of abhorrent things that are completely inexcusable and even with reason, a continued behavior or even once is understandable enough reason for the person to wanna cut contact. My issue lies in the fact, that it seems more and more like ppl are replacing 'excuse' with 'reason'. Because yes, you don't have to tolerate it but what exactly are you tolerating? Someone being in a mood? So what?! Unless they're being abusive, it's really shitty for you to cut out of your life because \"oh but they make me feel bummed out sometimes\". It's insanely selfish because when they do it, they expect all the attention in the world and on a good day, week, etc; they can get up on their high horse and talk about how easy it is to simply push through these problems and come out the other side. That's until they slip or have a moment of weakness. I'm so sick of hearing \"just get over it\", \"take walks\", \"work on this thing\" because I have tried so many things and nothing besides psychological and psychiatric intervention is helping me. As is the case with many others. If people could simply exercise or think their way out of having a mental illness then there wouldn't be medical fields around psychological ailments. There wouldn't be therapists, doctors, institutions around said disorders."

    "text": "Personal negative with being medicated I recently started going to college again to finish my degree. I need to get it to move forward in life in general. It's been much more challenging than I thought it could be. Initially I thought my age was getting the best of me. I have scored just above passing on almost all tests and a few assignments. It was driving me bonkers. I've never had to put effort into school in any capacity. Always almost perfect grades across the board. Even graduating #1 at the automotive school in 2018. Tons of awards all through school. What was this stark contrast? It came together after a conversation with a 21 year old classmate. On the most recent Chemistry exam, she got 8/28 28%, and I got 11/28 39%. She had made the comment that maybe she needs a med adjustment for a bit more focus. That statement hit me very hard. This is my first experience with school while being treated for bipolar 1. I would rarely sleep more than 3-4 hours a day, be fully manic at school and depressed in the evening. No studying for tests, slamming through assignments right before class, writing a couple page English papers in less than an hour, never failing. This is different. I like the center feeling I have now. I understand how much the illness wrecked many things in my life. I don't want to go back. I must come up with new tools to get through schooling. Thank you for reading my personal story. TLDR, my medicine has removed the manic but also removed my ability to literally do nothing to score perfect."

    "text": "Need help in supporting a friend through mental health struggle Need advice in helping a friend who's been struggling mentally. A little background on him: studying in 12th science suffering from low/negative self worth, regrets, anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation, self doubt, hopelessness, academic stress/pressure etc. (None of these conditions are officially diagnosed) #An outline of what has caused his suicidal thoughts recently: He took a decision a while ago and couldn't stick to it and is about to face/facing the consequences which has led to his suicidal thoughts. As for now, I've taken necessary steps to ensure his well being for the next 2-3 months but I don't know how to help him anymore besides professional help. P.S: I've always tried my best to help him and never invalidated his feelings. #The full story: [Had to attach it as an image due to character limit restricted] [P.S: I'm new to reddit so please forgive me if I've broken any rules, and this is a repost as the OP's format was messes up] #My advice: I've advised him to open up to his parents about everything because who knows maybe they might consult a psychologist. He's reluctant to seek professional help because he can't afford it on his own and doesn't want to involve his parents as he thinks they'll consider him to be weak for needing professional help. #His options (acc. To him) Now according to him he has two options (the latter being the best in his opinion): 1: Open upto his parents sooner or latter (because the discussion is inevitable as he will have to discuss with them ultimately when the results are out) and then take a drop year which involves pressure from literally everywhere: self+parents+family+the fact that he's wasted a year and failed once+expensive. 2: End everything before the results are out. According to him, this is the best option as it is the ultimate solution to all of his problems. Now honestly, I don't wanna lose a great friend like him. Just a little information about him, he values mental health more than anyone else I know, but is still a little biased about professional help (a little orthodox mindset about professional help ig). Even I'm living with the burden of not having called his parents yet and told them everything which I think would make things worse or weird idk. I could call his parents and tell them everything even if it costs me our friendship because honestly it's way better than regretting having done nothing later. As for taking a drop year, he's afraid of facing everything once again and is certain the he'll fail once again. He has a very pessimistic mindset and negative views about himself. And looking on the positive side, if he does make it even in a top institution, with or without a drop year, he's afraid of the things he'll have to face in future like socializing+communication+building confidence (he's very underconfident right now). P.S: he never really shows whatever he's going through. Always plays dumb or immature or happy/neutral. And he's never had a well/healthy relationship with his parents either so the fact that opening up to his parents is difficult is understandable. Now my question for you guys is what should he do without feeling more crappy than he already is? Or what can I do for him to ease his sufferings? Imo, the biggest challenge in front of him that could make things a little easier is opening upto his parents."

Next, I figured being social online would be enough. Talking to strangers through a phone is a lot less stressful to me, for example on discord! Now my problem is that I'm completely attatched to one of my friends on there, I got impulsive and now he's seen things he shouldn't have, and I'm letting his attitude effect my choices, my mood, my feelings about myself... This always happens. I'm neurodivergent, I think that explains my weird relationship with people. I'm not sure what to do anymore, since no matter how I try to socialize, I end up burnt out and overwhelmed; if I don't socialize, I feel really lonely. Does anyone have any advice?"

I also had some weird brief hallucinations(?) that really scared me. I would like some help/advice/comfort. I've had a very strange sleep pattern the last couple days and trying to sleep has been very scary for me. I took a nap that ended up lasting a little too long today and woke up at night. since then I've felt a lot of emotions, but mostly feeling strange and dissociated. I've been questioning whether or not I just got a fever because of how tonight has been going. While trying to sleep I've had big spikes in anxiety and confusion, with some hallucinations. I have visual snow syndrome (you can google it) which makes sleeping very hard as the static slowly turns to weird shapes and lights when I close my eyes, usually fading when I open my eyes, sometimes causing everything to slightly flash. This all gets really bad when I have a night like this because it's really bad for my anxiety to have to not focus on all the shit I'm seeing while trying to sleep. Typically if I'm tired enough it's not the biggest deal, but tonight I saw some weird stuff I've never experienced before. the first time something new happened was literally just the static momentarily disappearing, which was extremely strange for me since I've had it my whole life. The second thing was a straight up jumpscare in my vision, I've never even seen anything other than shapes and colors trying to sleep, so this really messed me up. My heart was beating super fast and everything in the room appeared to shake really fast. The third thing was the static going away for about a half-second again, but then I saw a quick glimpse of a vhs tape.. This makes no sense to me because I was pretty awake. It doesn't help that I would be consistently confused by just opening my eyes and trying to figure out what I'm seeing in the dark static. I've been dissociating for quite a while now, longer than it usually lasts, and I'm just hoping for things to get better or some advice. I still need some sleep, but im currently still very out of it and paranoid and just want some comforting and to feel like myself."

Whenever I watch tv shows or play video games I kind of get too emotional attached to it. It has to be kind of realistic stuff, I mean, I enjoy fantasy shows and games like the witcher and stuff like that, but it doesn't make me feel this way. I get seriously depressed after watching or playing certain things. Especially if the characters are in distress, and their histories and lives really gets to me. I dream about it, the soundtracks haunt me in weeks or so, and I feel unable to get out of the feelings and the world the show or game created for me. Like I just played through this games about teenagers on the road, a masterpiece with an amazing story and soundtrack, and I can't seem to let it go. I think about the story all the time, the music is in my head night and day, and you know, and almost no matter what I do I can't seem to snap out of it. Like in many shows and games, I had some really rough (but also kind of amazing and free) teenage years - due to the loss of a parent - and for many years I really tried to escape my family and reality in many ways. Now I have house, husband, kids and dogs, and really living a normal boring life. But is that why? Is it some sort escapism through the shows and games because I really want their lives? Hyperfixation? Or wtf is it? Does anyone else experience this? I would really like to enjoy my shows and games after the kids have gone to bed,, but without the weird feelings that can haunt me for weeks afterwards. Is it possible? What is wrong with me?"

She said she wanted to see me in 2 weeks since I was in crisis.. and then less than 24 hours later told me she could no longer treat me. She gave me referrals that were online exclusively- when she claimed her reason for dropping me is based on my need for in person care. When using the platform I have currently used to manage my mental health, I discovered that the closest in person option for me is 67 miles away. Please keep in mind that in my last session I told her I haven‚Äôt been able to get out of bed for 2 weeks. So I have 30 days left of my meds.. which means I need to find another provider. I have struggled with mental illness my entire life and finally decided to start tackling it a couple years ago. Being told I‚Äôm too crazy for a provider and need to find someone else is WILD. It took me 6 months to book the virtual appointment with her. The idea that I could attend in person sessions is WILD. I guess we‚Äôre about to see nature play out the way it should."

    "text": "Phrases keep repeating in my head For the last couple of years my mind will just repeat a single phrase dozens of times throughout the day. I don't really know what triggers it but it's like an automatic response to whenever there's gap in my thinking and it's starting to really bother me. The phrases change eventually right now it's \"how much money are you making\" and it's been that way for probably a year. The last one was \"how many people have you killed\" which I don't really get because I've never killed anyone. For a while I just thought it just kinda a goof but I just can't stop it. The last one didn't really bother me because it just seamed like a joke sometimes I'd respond to it with a bullshit answer but constantly asking myself how much money I'm making when I'm full time student is really stressing me out. It just comes out of nowhere and its like I'm constantly judging myself for my own lack of employment. Has anyone encountered this issue before and found a way to deal with it."

An employer doesn‚Äôt hire us, we think none of them will. When we get a bad grade, we believe that we are stupid. But in reality, everything shifts. The good, the bad, it all comes and goes. Pain is temporary. Feelings are temporary; even our time on earth is temporary. If you‚Äôre struggling now, remember that it won‚Äôt last forever. Likewise, if things are great, that won‚Äôt last forever either, so you better make the best out of this temporary time and try not to give power to temporary emotions to ruin our lives."

Lately I‚Äôve been feeling lonely, more isolated, have a lack of energy of and motivation. It‚Äôs weird though, I want social interaction but feel intense anxiety, self-consciousness, or fear of judgment in a lot social situations that prevent me from seeking interaction out. Since I graduated college I rarely leave the house. I graduated college in December of 2023 but many job interviews later no luck on finding a job. This has left me really unmotivated as of late. Just recently since November of last year my hands have been injured preventing me from enjoying hobbies that I used as an escape. Seeing a psychiatrist is definitely possible. I recently started going to a new Primary Care provider for the first time in many years which is paid for by IHS and they have a behavioral psychiatric department. I just need the courage to talk about my mental health with my provider as it‚Äôs really hard for me coming from a family that downplayed mental health all the time. I‚Äôm not sure I want or even need medication. I have a virtual follow up appointment two weeks from now with my primary care and I think I may bring up my thoughts there but I‚Äôm anxious."

But then I get these days when I stop functioning, I can't perform basic tasks, I binge eat constantly (even though it's painful and I want to stop), I feel horrible but absolutely detached from my emotions at the same time. It's ruining my life, I'm wasting time, I'm destroying my body. I'm not doing my projects for uni, I feel like I'm dissapointing everyone. Everything seems fine in my life, I have a loving family, a wonderful girlfriend, a cat who I love with all my heart - but my brain sabotages everything constantly and I don't know why. Nothing triggers these episodes, I don't know what's wrong, I desperately want to get better and want to live. Nothing seems to work and I don't know what to do. I'm desperate and I'm looking for advice, if any of this sounds familiar to anyone here, and if anything helped - please let me know. Thank you a lot for reading"

    "text": "What do I do m(23) hello, I‚Äôve struggled a lot the past 3 years with my mental health and it‚Äôs honestly only been a downward spiral this far. It started off with some panic attacks, anxiety and depression, and I have started self harming as of about 2 months ago. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on with me tbh but I‚Äôve noticed some patterns which I‚Äôm here to ask about. What stands out the most for me is the CONSTANT mood swings. My mood can go from happy and enthusiastic to sad/even depressed in a matter of hours, sometimes even shorter. I‚Äôve noticed my mood can switch either at random, or from very small changes in my surroundings, thoughts, etc. these mood changes are really frustrating and I don‚Äôt know if this is normal or not. It doesn‚Äôt feel normal atleast. I can‚Äôt recall being like this 4 years ago even. I feel like shit because of this and I don‚Äôt trust myself anymore. Note that I‚Äôm not currently as depressed (idek if I even am depressed currently) as I was 2 years ago. My self harm stems from self hatred for the most part. Another thing I‚Äôve noticed that genuinely scares me (im just venting atp), is that my feelings towards people also change drastically as my mood changes. I can go from wanting to talk with the person, love the person etc. to almost feeling a weird type of ‚Äúhatred‚Äù towards them. It‚Äôs hard to describe the exact feeling, but it‚Äôs like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want anything to do with you‚Äù pretty much. What scares me is the feelings are very real and I can barely force myself to go against my brain in these moments. This effects both my friends and family. Could this be something undiagnosed or is it normal? do I bring this up with my psychologist? Thoughts? Thanks, confused guy in his 20s"

That same year, the last day of class, my mom was at work and I technically was at my dad's house that week.

I just agree, I tell them I will try but I don‚Äôt at all. I do anything in my power to just get worse.

My partner actually pointed it out, that I wasn‚Äôt getting better and he seemed frustrated. He tells me he wants to help me and worries about me, but his actions and responses say otherwise. He brought up about asking if I wanted to have a break, and I completely blanked out. I don‚Äôt want to leave him, but I don‚Äôt want to be in a relationship too. I love him, more than he knows I do. But why do I get the feeling, the urge to let go? I am so confused, I am so lost. Just a little info, I‚Äôm a disorganized attachment style which messes things up even more. I engage in self-harm and self-sabotage whenever a difficult situation occurs. From also my past observations for a year, I studied myself comparing if I also have BPD. I don‚Äôt want to self diagnose, but It‚Äôs affecting me so much. I am very suicidal as well. My anxiety doesn‚Äôt make this easier too.

I‚Äôm 21 years old and I‚Äôve never felt more lost in my life, I hate my job, I have 1 friend and I‚Äôve never felt more distant. I feel alone all the time regardless of where I am or who I‚Äôm with I just feel so different. Ive literally always felt different from people my own age and it doesn‚Äôt matter how old I am. When I was 10 I felt much older, when I was 15 someone told me I‚Äôm like a 40 yr old in a 15 year old, now I‚Äôm 21 and I still feel the same way. I think I potentially have undiagnosed ADHD or some level of autism but I feel embarrassed to get a test done due to stigma in my family. Also it probably sounds like I‚Äôm introverted or not very socially capable but I had a relationship for 2 years and there‚Äôs been periods of time that I have had lots of friends. But in the last year I just find it hard to connect/want to connect with people and I don‚Äôt know if the lack of desire comes from my previous relationship and a fear to lose someone so close again. I was so close with my ex girlfriend but we had such a difficult relationship, we argued quite a lot and arguments would become extremely emotional and almost hard on each of our mental healths, but in the same sentence, the times of love were incomparable to anything else I‚Äôve ever felt. Everyone around me thought that it was for the best that we broke up but I am so done with taking peoples opinions I need to trust my own decisions. As I said I feel so lost and when people give opinions on things it makes me feel so swayed because I clearly do not trust my own judgement. This becomes an issue because I then walk around with 1000 voices in my head saying different things and I can‚Äôt have clear thoughts which makes me so agitated and upset. Also to the point of having few friends, when I was around 14/15 I had a friend group with like 20 people which slowly split up, I was then in a group with around 8 people and essentially I think because I was the quietest I got excluded from group activities and found out they were all talking about me very badly (I didn‚Äôt do anything it was just about my appearance really) following this I had basically 0 friends for a while which as a 16/17 year old is incredibly hard (I used to cry everyday before and after school) I ended up getting a few friends in college which was good but I still held an anxiety so close to me. After college I went to work and everyone left my home town so I was alone again, I met my ex girlfriend a few months later and she was relatively alone too so I think we used eachother as a crutch so when we did things with other people I think we both were a bit jealous which causes issues. We have been broken up for 6 months now and although I wasn‚Äôt too upset at the time it feels worse for me now (i don‚Äôt know if this is normal). Anyway, in the past year/1.5 years I‚Äôve also had infections and things physically wrong with me basically the entire time which was so damaging for me. One of the infections had me hating literally everything and it was torturous for months (I hated life so much) as soon as that infection was over I got another. But yeah I‚Äôve reached the text limit so I‚Äôll summarise, I don‚Äôt know what I want, I don‚Äôt know how I feel, I don‚Äôt understand anything and I feel so numb to everything but I just pretend it‚Äôs not bad"

Friends and family listen but they don't really hear what I am saying, and have grown tired of helping try to make sense of things. I am hurting really bad and feel like I am screaming internally all the time. So here is the story, I met this girl 14 years ago in University. It was love at first sight on my end. We had lots of little coffee dates, and walks in the parks, and around the city, but she soon got back together with her ex-boyfriend. Then broke up with him, than met another guy and eventually married him and had a child. Now this whole time I was still friends with her. When her marriage went south, she sought me out for support, eventually it grew into an affair with me. Then it stopped for no apparent reason. I did not question it, I assumed it was bad timing, she mentioned she was going to try counselling with her husband, so I backed off. Next thing I know she is dating someone and I was left very confused. But, again I decided it was just bad timing and the situation being so complex, I did not want to admit her bad nature. Several years passed with me now being held at arms length, she made it clear she did not want messages from me. I respected her wishes for the most part, never calling her or sending her more than a \"happy birthday\". During this time she left that guy and found another who became husband number 2, which she had a second child with. Fast forward to the fall of 2024, I receive a message from her, completely unprompted she informs me that marriage number 2 is ending. Now, I am older and wiser at this point, but as it turns out still completely stupid where this woman is involved. I ask her motivation for telling me this, she replies that she is just looking for friendship and support, and that she is not looking for anything romantic *\"RIGHT NOW\" (yes she actually said that)*. I acknowledge this as it makes sense, but I also make sure she understands I still have feelings for her. She confirms that she understands and says that she is not uncomfortable with me having told her that. So we begin talking, a lot *(nearly everyday)*. I start to help her understand certain elements of what she is going through *(IPV)* as it is very much related to my education. I help provide contact information for various resources and legal information for the divorce and possible custody battle over her second child. I even help with some advertising for her business. I feel I was being a true friend and support, because that is what she said she needed *RIGHT NOW*. Then the week of Valentines Day rolls around, I had this whole plan in my head for doing something small (not a date or anything) as I did not think she was at the point of starting anything new. At this point she reveals that she is going on a date Valentines weekend. As you may imagine given everything you just read this triggers me. I told her I was not aware she had started dating yet. She says that she thinks it is time and it can be just a *\"fun casual thing, nothing serious\"*. Well at this point I can't help but feel hurt, so I explain that this information has really caught me off guard due to my feelings for her and how much we've been chatting. Que the gaslighting, she tells me she had no idea I felt that way about her, and dismisses me when I show her a screenshot of me disclosing those feelings back in October. Cont'd"

I used to have lots of friends so the perception is that I still do - but I lost them all in the past year because half the people I was friends with were immature and toxic alcoholics, and the other half my depression got too bad to keep up. I used to be in university so people think I still am but I dropped out because smoking pot is the only thing that makes me feel like I‚Äôm not on the verge of sobbing 24/7 and I can‚Äôt stop smoking it no matter how hard I try because I don‚Äôt want to be alone with my thoughts. I‚Äôm pretty sure the only reason I haven‚Äôt had s*uicidal thoughts is because I love my two cats too much to leave them. On the outside I appear financially stable but I‚Äôve been jobless basically for 14 months, I‚Äôve had to leave/got let go three restaurant jobs before my three months were up because my depression got so bad - I couldn‚Äôt get out of bed to wash my hair, let alone go for a WALK. Keep in mind - I am very intelligent, I‚Äôve always done well in school, and I‚Äôm still smart. I had to start an Onlyfans out of necessity and have been excusing it under the fact that I don‚Äôt post my face, but it makes me feel used. I have no family to help me financially and I‚Äôm completely broke. I have a couple thousand dollars and my lease is up in 5 weeks and I‚Äôm supposed to be moving to Toronto to be with cousins and get a fresh start but I have no clue how I‚Äôm going to make that happen financially because I need a plane ticket, and damage deposit, and I have to pay for my two cats to fly up. I‚Äôm on the verge of crying 24/7 and barely leave my house. I just make content for two hours, completely numb, and then sit in my couch and watch TV, or take a bath. I feel like such a loser but I literally CANT HELP IT. The only people in my life who I‚Äôm close with in any capacity are the few men that I‚Äôve seen over the past year, and they usually just want to sleep with me for my looks and because of my ‚Äúsocial status‚Äù but I can never get close with them because I feel like such a fraud and a loser and a liar, and if I do get close, they realize I‚Äôm a depressed anxious weird 23 year old who has never had a boyfriend in her life living under the guise of having a lot of Instagram followers and being pretty. I slept with a two men this year, and now I‚Äôm 7 weeks pregnant and miscarrying in a Province alone unable to tell either of them, and with no friends to help. Tbh the only thing keeping me going besides my cats are the fact that I know people think I have it together. I don‚Äôt even think it‚Äôs any of those things that are the reason I‚Äôm so sad. I‚Äôm just so lonely."

This is a new account if anyone was wondering, mainly just to protect my identity which is very much public on my main account. I am a 17 Year old Junior in High School On Monday I am going to my school psychologist, who is my only resource right now, however I trust her and is the only adult I am truly comfortable with talking about my problems with. She has been my school psychologist since elementary school, and I have had monthly meetings with her for years, however every single one of those meetings I have lied to her. Thats because every single time i‚Äôd hint towards being depressed, and she would ask me if I was thinking of hurting myself, killing myself or had attempted either; and I have always lied and said I have not. But ever since I was in around 4th grade I have had intermittent thoughts of death, and a continual depression that I have been incapable of breaking free of. I have struggled with a lack of friends, ADHD and divorced parents. My father being arrested for Child Pornography, being groomed online at a young age, family members committing suicide and being under constant stress at home. Writing all of this down and putting it together makes me realize how much I need to help myself, especially after begging so many friends to help me themselves. Now, 17 years into life I have so many friends that I love and love me. I have a girlfriend of three months and the only thing holding us back is my own depression. On paper my life today seems so perfect but now for the past week my mind has been scrambled and just now I have had the revelation I need to do this. Feel free to wish me luck, give me advice on what to open up about on Monday, i‚Äôm terrified yet just thinking about it makes me feel like a heavy weight is being lifted off of me. I am especially worried however, what will happen if I tell my psychiatrist of my thoughts of suicide and self-harm. I have had so many friends go through the same, yet every case has seemed so different. Maybe I will even update everyone if everything goes well."

If they're suicidal and talking to me about it, for some reason i dont care..? I just feel so numb and such a huge lack of emotion and empathy when i'm not talking to them in real life, since i dont have to act all kind and whatever over text.

(which ended up in be being hospitalized many times due to severe wounds.) in real life, i do care and i do have those feelings, but when im alone and with my actual feelings and thoughts, im numb. the only people that i actually have care about are my family, and im still so careless to their problems too. i feel so guilty, it claws at my heart knowing how terrible of a person i am truly. am i a psychopath? and sometimes i feel like im being torn apart. \"i care so deeply about this person, blalala and whatever\" \"i wouldnt care if they died. \" (even if the person in the situation is one of my bestest friends???? sorry for the terrible explanation, i just feel absolutely crazy. idk if i have bipolar disorder or smth or if im just a completely normal person who has bad mania episodes or something randomly and is so euphoric that i almost kms. i honestly just think this might all be for attention, why do i need to prove that im the worst? i'll edit this post later with more info when i remember it, its late rn and my memory is extra shitty. i feel like im being torn apart."

    "text": "20 F struggling with depression and I don‚Äôt know what to do TW: mental health, family drama, stress etc Hi, I‚Äôm 20 and currently in college. I‚Äôm on academic probation and failing out of school. I was recently hospitalized with 7 stomach ulcers and I am through intense mental and physical health struggles. I‚Äôm in therapy twice a week and on medication, but things keep getting worse. My single mom had to take on over $100k of debt to keep me in school, and she doesn‚Äôt have a job. I‚Äôm terrified for us financially. We‚Äôve always struggled, but it feels like everything is collapsing this year. I‚Äôve also been involved in a traumatic family lawsuit since I was 8 years old, and over the past year I‚Äôve had to take an active role in it. I‚Äôm still waiting on a judgment related to finances that we were depending on, and I‚Äôve heard nothing. Because of the case, my grandfather suddenly stopped talking to me and cut me off emotionally and financially. The stress has caused my mom and I to fight so much she‚Äôs lovely but so stressed herself. To make things worse, my younger brother hasn‚Äôt spoken to me in over a year since I came out to him as gay. He was the one person I thought understood me ‚Äî now I feel like I‚Äôve lost him too. I feel like I can‚Äôt go home to take time off of school because it will lead to so much fighting with how my mental health is. I‚Äôm not rlly able to do anything at all. I quit my dance team, distanced from friends, and feel like I‚Äôve withdrawn from everything. Even my previously happy and healthy relationship is struggling now due to all this stress. My dad left when I was 8 and has never spoken to me since. My family feels broken, and I feel completely alone in the world. I know I‚Äôm doing what I can ‚Äî therapy, medication ‚Äî but nothing seems to touch the pain of losing family, financial safety, or the legal stress. I just don‚Äôt know where to begin. How do I start putting my life back together?"

    "text": "I don‚Äôt know where else to ask this, so if I get opinions on if I‚Äôm high on the psychopathy spectrum? I meant, ‚Äúcan I get some opinions?‚Äù When I was a child, I never felt bad for anything bad happening to others and always saw their struggles or having to deal with them as a bother. For example, someone would tell me that they like me or something they want from me and I‚Äôd either ignore them or do something to not have to deal with it because it wasn‚Äôt what I wanted. Then when I got older, I started feeling shame and guilt for either upsetting people or getting negative reactions from others. This didn‚Äôt happen naturally though. The only reason why I would feel either way was because someone told me that‚Äôs how I‚Äôm supposed to feel when that happens. The main thing that makes me wonder is because of how when I get a negative reaction from someone I change my behavior to not get that reaction even if I have to lie about how I actually feel. I wouldn‚Äôt say that this is because I am a people pleaser, but more because I don‚Äôt want to have to deal with the negative reactions, because they stop me from getting what I want. I don‚Äôt change what I say just to make them feel better or to placate them, I say whatever I have to, to change the negative reaction and convince them in a way that gets a positive reaction. I feel fake because of this and a part of me wants for people to know the real me and accept my opinions and feelings for what they are, but at the same time I have no problem lying about how I feel to not have to deal with the negative reactions. I have no problem lying about everything I have to just so that I don‚Äôt have to deal with a negative reaction. I don‚Äôt know if this is trauma or if I‚Äôm a psychopath because when I didn‚Äôt do this, I just would either not talk much or I would have to deal with not being in relationships because my feelings always made my partners feel bad. Like I would say that I don‚Äôt feel the same way they do about something and it would hurt them. I didn‚Äôt feel bad about it hurting them, but I didn‚Äôt like the result of them not liking me anymore which took away the good feeling that I wanted. Regardless of all this, I have never been an angry or violent person and I have never liked or wanted to hurt anyone. I just wouldn‚Äôt care if I did. What does this make me? Please if anyone has insight it would be helpful. Thank you."

Every night after my classes, I look up at the tracks and remind myself the trains don't run past 9 pm. If I wanted to go up there and throw myself onto an oncoming train, I just have to make sure it's before 9 pm or I'd look like an idiot. It's such a morbid thing to think every time I step out of my dorm, but it's how I've been living for the past 7 months. I don't know if I'll ever do it, but I know it's not even going to take longer than 15 minutes. Typing this all out is making me realize maybe my brain's a bit more messed up than I'd hoped. There's nothing I can do about it though, I have no immediate support system and I don't have the money to drag myself to a therapist. I just make sure that I'm too occupied by school to do anything else or that I don't go out before 9 pm to buy something. I wish someone else would do it for me. I go out and stare at the ground in hopes that a car rams into me on my way to school. I don't care about walking past shady places because I welcome being murdered by someone. I've had passive suicidal ideation since I was 12, but lately, it's kind of hilarious how bad it's been. I don't go more than an hour without my brain telling me to jump out of my 27th-floor window. There's also the fact that my noise-cancelling headphones broke and everything is so damn loud. Louder than it was before. Like someone turned the volume up on Earth by 20%. I had to leave a classroom because a group was presenting and popping balloons as a part of a gimmick, and I kept jumping like I was getting shot at. Everything is kind of fucked. I don't have anyone else to tell this and I also don't want to go insane pretending it's not happening, so this is probably the closest I get to being heard."

They made me feel bad, we no longer shared the same values, they didn‚Äôt understand me emotionally, and being around them just hurt me.

This past year has left my life upside down, and I am unsure if I have the strength to fight through it. The short versions is that I have been arrested a couple of times, sent to a mental facility, landed myself in jail, served a restraining order, forced on an ankle monitor, kicked out of my apartment, accrued significant legal and medical debt, forced on unpaid leave from work... among many other things this past year. It feels like the trauma just keeps coming, and I am never left with a chance to breathe. During my manic episodes I felt like they were out of body experiences where I was never in control. Looking back on the things I have done, I can't even understand what was going on through my mind. It feels like someone else was in control, and I was just watching. Each day, it feels like I am walking on eggshells, because at any moment I might fall back into depressive or anxious thoughts. There are still so many obstacles in front of me, and my triggers are still there. No matter what I just feel lost, and part of me is exhausted from this life The positive, I am on a decent medication, going to therapy consistently, and living with my mother out of necessity (though she likely has schizophrenia, and its difficult managing that). Perhaps all of this was necessary to build me into a stronger person. I am not sure."

To make a long story short I was having panic attacks all throughout my undergrad due to trauma, so I finally went to the hospital where I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression. After trying two low dosage medicines my doctor pretty much put me on citalopram (celexa) and called it a day. I took it for 2 years and didn‚Äôt notice much of a difference. But with lack of support from my family and lack of income, I couldn‚Äôt afford a therapist or a psychiatrist so I just took it every day. October of 2024 my (F25) significant other (M25) died. I was the happiest when I was with him. My mental health was still quite bad, but it was manageable and I was able to get through the day without feeling like I was unloveable and stupid and broken. Since he‚Äôs died I feel that my depression and anxiety have gotten worst. But for the first time in my life I‚Äôm seeing a psychiatrist about this (it‚Äôs through my school so free of charge‚Ä¶) and we‚Äôve changed my medications 3xs already. Currently I‚Äôm on buspar and lithium and I take trazodone at night. It‚Äôs been like this for 3 months now and nothing has changed. I‚Äôm scared to say that medicine doesn‚Äôt work for me but I don‚Äôt think it does. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm struggling with any other mental disorder or if my grief is simply too much, but medication is really making me so tired. I‚Äôm tired of having to deal with these stupid side effects l while not getting any better. If I don‚Äôt keep myself distracted then I‚Äôm a huge mess. And my distractions are sleeping around with random men and smoking a ton of weed. Nothing else helps. And I feel so disgusting after I do that. I‚Äôm sorry this is so jumbled. I really just don‚Äôt know what to do. I try to do all the ‚Äúright things‚Äù like drinking water, going on walks, trying this routine thing out. It just doesn‚Äôt work no matter how hard I try. And I‚Äôm not trying to ‚Äúfix‚Äù myself. I stopped thinking like that a while ago. I just want to be able to function without wanting to end myself whenever I‚Äôm not sleeping with a random man or high from weed. Am I stuck like this? On top of this unbearable grief I feel like I‚Äôm ruining my life. I feel so stupid and so worthless. I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm sorry. Does anyone relate? Or am I just a lost cause?"

    "text": "Has anybody else had this? Hi everyone. From time to time I have periods in my life were I keep thinking my life is fake. I wouldn‚Äôt say the thoughts are persistent to the point were it is cause for concern, but often just taking a look around me I feel like the things my eyes are seeing are some sort of video game render, or picture. My vision is sort of ‚Äûflat‚Äù. There are times when it really gets to me though. I realize looking back I also had a period of this last year. At some point it must have gone away, and I guess it‚Äôs back now. In September of last year I made a decision do cut down my weed consumption to just the weekends, thinking it was brought on by the weed. I started smoking when I was a young teen, smoked regularly throughout my mid teens and everyday, quite consistently, between ages 17-19 (for reference I turn 20 in a couple of weeks). I‚Äôve also had my fair share of coke, molly, lsd, shrooms. Is it possible that I‚Äôve cooked my brain? I‚Äôm trying to think back to when I first had that feeling of ‚Äûwhy does everything look like it‚Äôs a game.‚Äù It was after I had taken xanax for the first or second time at the age of 14. Something just seemed off about my sight, or my perception, it‚Äôs very hard to explain in other terms then my vision being video game like. Basically this is the feeling I have practically all the time now. Back then it probably lasted a day or two. It‚Äôs really difficult to explain this feeling so im hoping someone here has had a similar experience and knows what im talking about. The thing is I can‚Äôt really remember what it was like before that feeling, our without it. I guess I would like to get back to that since it is when life seemed more ‚Äûreal‚Äù. Even though as I mentioned before this seems to come in waves, I‚Äôve noticed myself questioning the reality I live in more and more. Anyways, to wrap this up: can someone please tell me what‚Äôs wrong with me and give some tips on how I can get better? I‚Äôm sort of starting to get scared that if I keep thinking about this it‚Äôs gonna keep getting worse"

Most of my friends think of me as smart or people in my add math class think of me as an equal(But I don't know why I also think everyone looks down on me as a lesser being in a sense). Yet I can't get over the same self image of I am dumb and worthless. You know the feeling where you aren't good at anything in particular. I had many mental freak outs, my mom would absolutely lose it when ever I would have these. For a bit more context on my dad's side my grandpa was bipolar, ended up killing himself later on. On my mom's side her uncle and some other people ended up killing themselves due to mental health and other complications. My mom currently is on anti-depressants and my dad smokes and drinks. They are going through a divorce currently. My grand mother on my mom's side passed away 2 months ago 3 months after my grand father on my mother's side also. I used to get bullied at school till I be friended the bully instead, so no bullying at school at school anymore. I just always have a voice in the back of my head no matter what I do just echoing inside my head that I am dumb and worthless. I could make a simple mistake and have it stick with me through out my entire day. It could be as simple as asking a question or making a remark or getting something done differently but with the same result it would have me thinking about it constantly for hours and some times days about why I did it and what part of my retarded self made me do it. For example I got the top of my physics class but an intro to a narrative I wrote I didn't like the way I wrote it, don't get me wrong the assignment wasn't that bad but it wasn't what I wanted and in my mind if it isn't how I want to write it I failed the subject and the assignment and I just kept thinking about it this and beating my self up and stressing about it, this happened around a week and a bit ago and I am still thinking about it. I just wish I could stop this, I don't know why I think like this and every imperfection I have thought about ending it many times before, since I was 10 if I remember correctly. I just wish it could all just stop in a sense. I pay attention to every mistake I make every day all the time. People my age usually think about getting girl friends and so on, being popular and everything. I just think about money/success all the time I stress about it so much. Everyday I am just thinking on how my life will play out. In my mind my only way of proving my worth is by getting a lot of money/success and I think of money as the only way to be happy. I try and change but it is as if my mind is split into two parts, one part is fighting with the other over a virtual control in my head and my emotions can switch easily. I wish to change but I don't know how. I feel like if I lose the fact everyone views me as smart I lose everything and there is no point anymore. Writing just asking for a friend or some one who has been in my spot before. Just want to feel better and be happier."

Mind you these are the same people who will tell me that I should come out of my shell. That I should talk more, that I should let people see the real me."

    "text": "Opinion on memory loss I don‚Äôt know if this is paranormal or not but my father who is 45 years old has memory loss. This has been since 2019. Sometimes when he is just sitting or working he falls asleep or I should say he faints. We try to wake him up but he wouldn‚Äôt wake up or even move a bit. After a few hours he himself would wake up and start asking us who we are, he loses his memory that time . But one thing I find odd is that he forgets our names and what are we related to him but he never forgets some specific things like to not watch mobile phone. One thing which made me question about his memory loss is that he always remembered his office laptops password even after losing his memory one more thing is that he also remembers a specific thing and that was to not play minecraft because it was addictive as he said before losing memory. After losing his memory yet he remembers that minecraft is addictive. These memory losing episodes happen at least 6-7 times a year. Could any expert advice me on whether he is actually losing his meme key or is he just acting? Thank you."

    "text": "Looking for support. Hey. I'm a teenager (16-18; not comfortable saying my actual age), M, in a pretty stressful situation. For years now, my mental health has been declining immensely. I was sexually abused for 2 years between the ages of 9 and 11, and while my abuser is behind bars now, the aftermath of what he did to me practically broke me. I've never been the same. I've developed a couple of disorders over the years such as BPD. My BPD has led me to spiral out and act in ways that I've hated myself for, but I also can't blame my behavior entirely on a disorder. I am not a good person. I'm a sociopath despite also having empathetic traits, I'm a compulsive liar, and something of a narcissist even while I hate my own guts. To make matters worse I'm a shut-in. I have 1 friend irl and we aren't very close. My previous few friendships have ended bitterly, and I rarely leave the house due to my fear of being perceived at all. The only friend I really have (that isn't online) is my mom. And she can never truly understand the depths of what I go through. My mental state has been declining rapidly for months, well, really it's been years, but it's really been noticeable within the last, I'd say nine months. I was in a relationship for about a year, with a girl who I'll call A, but a couple months ago we cut things short. We were fwb for about a week, but that's over now too, because I have continously let A down and shown her that I'm not a good person, unintentionally, but it still happened. She doesn't love me anymore and says she doesn't see herself ever loving me again. I know a lot of you will probably go \"just drop her, she's not that important,\" but that isn't the case for me. I really truly love her and I want to be a better person. I want to be okay again and I'm looking for advice in any form. Please. I'm desperate at this point."

    "text": "I can't think, I just want the noise to end I don't know what is wrong with me. I've been going to therapy for half year. Originally, it was to try to help me cope with my emotions and to regulate them, I'm not really able to have normal reactions to anything. It all seems to be amplified. The smallest thing can send me down a spiral to a point where I hurt myself or get me feeling euphoric, or both just within a few hours. The weird thing is, I would prefer to stay on that low, rather than to have my mind shift back and forth so quickly. It's exhausting to a point where I would rather not feel anything. Anyways, my therapy sessions quickly became about my relationships with alcohol, and I'll be the first to admit that it's problematic. I experience blackouts at least weekly and every time they cause extreme anxiety. I'm worried I might hurt someone someday. Still, I can't imagine going sober, it's the only thing that can make me feel at peace. I know my relationship with alcohol is problematic, but ever since my sessions became dominated by the topic, we've not had time to talk about anything else, hence why I'm turning to this place. A couple of months ago I started experiencing what I thought might be psychotic episodes. I told a friend about this and he told me not to jump to any conclusions and see how things developed. It's not been getting better. It's nothing extreme, but I will sometimes hear a ringing in my ear, a knock on the door or see something blocking my path when I'm out walking. The worst thing of all I experience, is that I can sometimes feel like someone is behind me. I can't relax, I feel like I am being watched, and I don't always know what is real. I just want to relax, I just want quite. It is all to noisy, I just want it to be over"

Will I ever see you again? The way you see me,I can never forget. Watching the sunrise together. The sadness will never end,but yet that doesn't mean that beauty can't be found still. I'm so deep in nostalgia, and most of the time it's all the time. What is life without remembrance of small moments that make you warm. Of bad times you almost miss when you think of something beautiful, like it was never bad at all. Because the pink clouds pull you back like you were never here, the grey fox sends it's roam threw fields of memory and straight into your room and wraps it's gentle cold arms around you. The music that made your heart beat like a love interest makes it's voice again. And even if the time was bad or good or somewhere in between, you feel safe in the cradle of memory. I heard nostalgia is a lie that makes bad moments seem like they were good all a long. But maybe nostalgia is just a reminder that even when life felt disgusting, even when we felt like we were roting, there was always beauty waiting for us, to see it, to feel it, the way we do it to remember it."

I couldn't help but notice when she was reaching for something that she had cut like marks on her wrists and was very concerned. I asked her to see it but she refused, I persisted and she still refused. I asked her how she got it and she said that she fell but it did not look like something you'd get from falling (they were lines and not a bruise). I told my father about this and he said that he noticed this a while ago and she told him that she fell too. I'm very concerned and don't know what to do, the only reason I recognized it was because when I was in middle school a very mentally unstable girl had a very similar thing, where she commonly wore long sleeved shirts (even during the summer), and I just happened to see those scars. I hate to see my sister go through something like this and I genuinely just wish it never happened, is there anything I can do to help?"

Hi, well... after some time to reflect I decided to post this, it's not easy for me to expose myself so much to the internet, I mean... I don't usually \"socialize\" with people on the internet or in real life... anyway, a little context: I have depression, anorexia nervosa and autism... I'm 16 years old and last year I didn't go to school at all, and as of today, March 22, I still don't have a school (in my country, Chile, it's very difficult to find places in average quality schools) last year I tried to \"get out of the way\" 4 times and I was hospitalized 3 times, in fact I spent my 15th birthday in the hospital... XD. but oh well... in 2023 I started with my eating disorder and I went from weighing 64 kilos to 47 kilos (I'm 1.70 tall, sorry for not putting it in pounds or feet) today I have that issue a little more under control, I'm eating what my parents give me and I try not to think about it too much, but... whenever I look in the mirror I feel fat, I can't see my bones anymore... it's frustrating... and my self-esteem is at rock bottom, I hate my face, I don't like going out because I'm embarrassed by how I look, I would post a photo of my face but I don't have the guts XD but basically I'm a pale pubescent with a face full of acne, glasses, dental braces, a bit overweight (or so I consider myself) and a bit short... I disgust myself... my body, my face... and my personality? Well... I'm a shy introvert who doesn't know how to talk to people. I have to say that I have friends from my taekwondo classes, but I only hang out with them during class. At least they're the best friends I could wish for :,) I go to the gym 4 days a week (or sometimes 5) that's one of my pathetic attempts to raise my nonexistent self-esteem... I also go to taekwondo classes 3 times a week, I have a green belt :D and on the days when I don't have gym or taekwondo I usually go for walks on a treadmill I have at home, exercise has helped me silence my brain that screams at me that I'm fat and that... basically makes me feel less guilty... and well, apart from the gym and taekwondo I never, EVER leave my house, I stay up all day playing Fallout on my PC, I don't even have online friends, and since I don't have school yet (my parents are looking for a school for me)... in short: I hate my life, I hate my physical appearance, my body, my face, my personality, I don't know what to do to change, I've tried using acne creams, I've gone to the gym, I spend a lot of time combing my hair before going out, I watch videos on how to get a \"glow up\" But... nothing makes me feel good... and I don't know what to do to change myself... I'm a loser in every sense of the word... I see couples my age, happy, loving, and... I feel sad, because deep down I know I'll never achieve that, I know I'll never have a girl, I'm a mess, what woman would even want to look at me? I have dreams, I want to be a soldier, but seeing my current situation that's a dream very, very far from me... oh! And I also have an addiction to... \"self-pleasuring\" and adult videos... no one knows, until now... anyway... I'm sorry for the length of the message, I got a little inspired while writing lol... thanks for reading and please, don't be like me... (Sorry for the spelling mistakes, Google Translate isn't very reliable sometimes :/ Sorry if I broke any rules, I don't usually use Reddit... Good night ;D)"

Not to sound egotistical, but I‚Äôm arguably the best player on our hs team. Anyway, today we had a game just like any other. It was non conference (so it mattered less than other games) and I wasn‚Äôt doing so hot today. If you know anything about baseball, you know umpires suck. And today it seemed like they had it out for me. I kept getting horrible calls and shit just wasn‚Äôt going my way. I ended up striking out 3 time today, which I rarely strike out at all. Not trying to blame the umpires, but they screwed me out of so many pitches. In my last at bat, I had bases loaded and one out and we were down by one. I struck out on a bullshit pitch the catcher caught in the dirt and I was livid. I‚Äôve never been good with my emotions, so that umpire heard about every swear word I knew as I walked back to the dugout fuming. I made my way down the steps to our locker room after slamming my helmet against my leg and throwing my bat (made sure no one got hit because I didn‚Äôt want to hurt someone else mid crash out) and I was so angry at myself for letting the team down, angry because my dad would be upset at me for failing in a crucial situation, and angry because it was my 3rd strikeout on the day. Long story short I ended up punching a wall as hard as i possibly could and ended up with a bad boxers fracture (yes I know fucking stupid decision. I have mental problems and I can‚Äôt control my anger sometimes.) I played the rest of the game but it was bruised and hurt like hell. So now, I‚Äôm out for at least 6 weeks if not worse depending what the ortho specialist tells me (I can‚Äôt get in until this next Monday).

Most everything except suicidal thoughts and self harm, thankfully. I'm losing friends because I can't bring myself to talk to them. I'm not enjoying things I used to enjoy. I'm somehow more socially inept than I was before, and I am more isolated than I ever was before. I'm gaining weight. I've been fat most my life but it's worse now than it ever was. I'm falling apart physically because of it. I am so depressed that I can barely get out of my bed to go to work, let alone take care of my hygiene. Ideally, I'd talk to a therapist about this, but here's where my main problem starts. I can't do it. I don't know why I can't, I just can't. Every day I think \"today's the day I'll call and set up an appointment.\" but I never do it. Every day I plan to make various calls. Today's the day I'll call a doctor and see what I can do about my failing health. Today's the day I'll call and get the oil changed in my car. It's needed the oil changed for several months. Every day I plan to take care of myself. Today's the day I go for a run. Today's the day I take a shower, lord knows I need one. Today's the day I talk to my friends again. Today I'm gonna go to the gym. Today I'm gonna yadda yadda yadda. I make these promises knowing I won't follow through on them. It's like there's a wall physically preventing me from doing things that would help. Some of it's my horrible memory. Some of it's my horrible issues with procrastination, but surely that can't explain everything. Surely, after 5 months, I'd just call a place and have them change the oil in my car. Why haven't I? I haven't got a clue. My issues are entirely self inflicted and I can't do anything about it. I say I'll do something about it, but I won't. Who could live like this? I'm just sitting here in my room or at work festering. This ain't no way to live. Maybe it is self harm, just a different way? I feel like anyone else in my position would just be able to make those phone calls and follow through on their plans. What makes me so pathetic that I can't even make a phone call that would literally only make my life better? TLDR: I have so many issues that could be resolved if I just helped myself, but for some unknown reason I just can't."

In the past 5 days it got to its worst the anxiety was bad enough for me to force puking and not leaving my room. It got better but still sucks because of how I feel. I look at myself and am disappointed that I am like this I feel so lonely, even though I should be fine. I planned to tell my mum but don't think I will because I'm scared she might think differently of me. I legitimately am just existing at this point and am tired of it. I have no motivation to do anything, But when I feel fine I think I faked it. it's bs that your brain can do that. Anyways I might spend tomorrow in bed to try and recharge myself a bit. Any advice please suggestions please let me know it's greatly appreciated."

It wasn't until I turned 9 that I realize being big was a problem. An issue, something that made my mother look bad. And my family have been my biggest haters when it comes to my appearance. But thats trauma for another time. I never tried to starve myself because I just could never do it. I was too greedy to. Instead I went the opposite route and binge. That was easy , comforting just eat and eat and eat. I would be in a cycle lose 10 lbs gain back 5. Its been like that for years now. Yet since turning 21 I just actually felt comfortable. I didnt hate the way I look alot of the times. I even received compliments. But for the first time ever I did something that I have never done before, which is throwing up. I forced myself to vommit. I dont even know how to feel. My grandma was talking to my mom on the phone and had said something that triggered it off and it was just after I ate something. I felt bad for eating because she was right I shouldnt be eating I look a mess and so I didnt even think twice and just puked. I always wished that I could be so small that people would want me to eat more than eat less. But for once in my life I felt fine with how I looked ( i suppose due to being away from my family at college)."

    "text": "I feel (occasionally) lonely Let me go straight to the point, in particular let me explain the \"occasionally\" in the title. In general, I(23M) feel \"good\" in my everyday life. I say \"good\" in quotation marks because it's not like I'm truly happy, but I'm okay. The problem arises when I meet a girl and start developing feelings for her. It's like I completely lose my mind. Quick side note: things have never really worked out for me with a girl. For one reason or another, I‚Äôve never had a real relationship, even though I've met quite a few girls. Just \"situationships.\" That being said, every time things don‚Äôt work out (which is always), the period afterward is devastating. I feel extremely lonely, behind compared to my peers, and the thought of seeing that girl with someone else kills me‚Äîeven though, in reality, nothing serious ever happened between us. This feeling lasts for weeks or even months, depending on whether she disappears from my life or if she‚Äôs part of a shared friend group, meaning I have to keep seeing her now and then. All these emotions completely vanish once I get over the \"crash.\" The point is, I don‚Äôt want this to keep happening. I want to be okay with myself, period. I‚Äôm not saying I want to be completely indifferent in situations like this, but I just don‚Äôt want to feel this overwhelming sadness for months. Also, I can‚Äôt afford it! During these rough periods, I can‚Äôt focus, I can‚Äôt study, I lose my appetite... And yet, I feel like it doesn‚Äôt make sense that I‚Äôm not okay with myself. I manage to achieve almost all the goals I set for myself (university, working out, personal challenges...), and overall, I‚Äôd say my life is going pretty well. I just can‚Äôt seem to be happy‚ÄîI really think I don‚Äôt know how to be okay on my own. And every time I get close to the possibility of a relationship, everything falls apart. What could I do?"

By small, I mean explaining something serious to my mom, venting at any capacity, being asked about jobs or other semi-serious events in my life (good or bad), or having to tell somebody about a disappointing venture in my life.

I shouldn‚Äôt be crying, I‚Äôm not sad, angry, upset, or even stressed, but it just starts flowing. Does anyone know why? I never used to cry and was severely depressed in my childhood, so I‚Äôm not sure if that has anything to do with it? Other subreddits I‚Äôve looked at have also talked about it being related to ADHD, which I suspect I have, but am just undiagnosed. Could that be it?

Even when I try to stop, I find myself going back, not even out of fear or excitement anymore, but just out of habit. I deleted apps from my phone, but I still find ways to search from my laptop. It‚Äôs like my brain is wired to keep doing it, even though I know it brings me nothing but stress. It‚Äôs not just the searching‚ÄîI also daydream about him a lot, sometimes for hours. I imagine scenarios, have full conversations in my head, and even respond out loud as if I were talking to him. It feels comforting in the moment, but afterward, I realize how much time I‚Äôve wasted and how disconnected I feel from my real life. What makes it worse is that my life feels empty outside of this obsession.

He‚Äôs been open with our family about not feeling mentally well, which I appreciate. His life now seems to revolve almost entirely around his computer ‚Äî he works at the PC, then plays games for hours, and smokes weed regularly. It feels like he‚Äôs stuck in a loop. Conversations with him are hard; after just a couple of minutes, the tone usually shifts to negativity about life, work, or people in general. He often seems angry or bitter, and it‚Äôs hard to talk to him without feeling like you're walking on eggshells. What‚Äôs also difficult is that our conversations are completely one-sided. He rarely, if ever, asks how I‚Äôm doing or shows interest in anyone else. When I do ask him something, it can feel like a burden for him to answer. I‚Äôve offered my support many times ‚Äî whether that‚Äôs talking, helping him get into training, or improving his daily routines ‚Äî but he always declines.

Basically, I have felt frustrated, angry, and highly stressed due to real life circumstances at work and personal development. Over the months, I have noticed first that my hobbies had completely disappeared and I would experience emotional highs and lows, after a bit everything started feeling superficial (people, life, food, color, everything), I started experiencing despair, many nights I would be in tears for some unknown reason, my dreams started becoming symbolic about what I felt, I started going through motions but almost like I have been experiencing something akin to derealization, and also I feel as though I have been getting depersonalized by just observing myself over the days, I feel like I am turning into an empty shell or something chipping away at me, my behavior has changed, and now more alarmingly I have been treating my peers in a way that intentionally causes confusion for my own leisure like a psychopathic behavior. I've made an appointment with a qualified doctor that's going to meet me next week. I'm just feeling it you know? Like I'm going to snap at someone. Or do something absolutely terrible/stupid.

Is everything my fault? there are so many questions that nobody can answer me, not even the family members. my face is stretched with fake smile, but enough is enough. when a person doesn't like his/her life, he/she does everything to change it. so I'm gonna plan to do the same. nobody cares about your emotions or you and they even insult you in different ways. everything has their limits. So I hope they won't be suprised what I'm gonna do. I hope this is motivative for people like me. we must do what we have to do, so that we'll have the future we've always dreamed of."

I'm desperately looking for a way out, life in my establishment is an ordeal without names. I've developed voices in my head that torture me all day and evening. I was recently diagnosed with hypersensitivity, anxiety, school phobia and depression. I'm seeing a shrink and I've already seen a psychiatrist. Despite everything, my suicidal thoughts are becoming more and more frequent. I'm starting to hear voices, whispers and fear of being alone with them (voices + whispers). I suspect more than what I've been diagnosed with but I'm not qualified on the subject. I cut myself regularly, the last time was hundreds of cuts on my thighs, I also cut myself inside my mouth, split my lips, overdosed on medication, slapped, hit on the face, stomach, chest or even legs. I'm looking for an escape from all this but the only way out would be death. I've also already drawn disturbing things, seen things like autopsies, cut bodies and all that category. These images are engraved in my memory and give me behaviors of post-traumatic stress that are always present. I have the impression of being constantly observed, followed, and judged constantly. I no longer go to school, on the verge of dropping out. Also, I have already tried to kill myself by overdosing too much, by crashing, by being run over, or by drowning in my bathtub. The shrink, for her part, often emphasizes the fact that I am obsessed with the things that happen in my head, and that I have many depressive tendencies underlining my diagnosis. So I am looking for help. I am open to any questions to move the matter forward. But I beg you if you have read my message, do not leave, do not leave me, I am terribly alone and I need help, an explanation about what is wrong with me..."

I don't really know how to describe it, but I have this feeling inside me, that I want some kind of big emotional release moment with someone. I'll give you some examples for better understanding. Like a coming out moment of telling someone \"I'm gay\" and them hugging and comforting me. Or telling someone about my mental health issues and getting to tell them everything while they comfort me. Basically like imagining something bad happening so that people will comfort you, only that it has an actual possibility of happening. I just don't know where this is coming from. I get this feeling sporadically in the last few years but I could never really put a finger on it, now I feel it's just an extreme need for some kind of comfort. The thing is I am fairly close with my family, have great childhood friends I see every two weeks and good friends in university, I also go to therapy, I have people to talk to. So I really just don't know where this is coming from."

    "text": "This is my case with the fear of having a serious mental illness. I'm not looking for peace of mind, I just ask that if anyone feels identified, they help me find the right help. First of all, I want to say that this will be translated since I am Spanish and I do not understand English well, I hope it is understood in the best way. I'm Victor, I'm 21 years old and since I was little I have anxiety, I used to give myself in class, in restaurants, in a movie theater to give some examples... well the case, on May 9, 2022 I woke up having thoughts which in my life had had of content to hurt me, I remember that the day before falling asleep I read a news about a boy who took his own life, logic tells me that that could be a possible trigger, I had the word \"suicide\" haunting my mind constantly and I didn't know what was happening to me, at first I was scared Because I didn't want to do that nor do I want to and I didn't know what was happening to me, I had a lot of anxiety, my chest hurt, I was short of breath, I was terrible... in the middle of that hell I thought, well, this will be a bad day and tomorrow I'll be fine, because the days went by and it was still the same, even from the fear I had I slept even with my mother imagine... a few days after this, being in my room this thought passed me which I remember perfectly. What if I kill my mother? If after the thoughts of hurting me I was already bad, imagine after that went through my head... literally that I couldn't even see my mother she was terrible, if before I was anxious because after thinking that I had twice as much... investigating through Google I found content about intrusive thoughts and such, at that moment reading about the subject I found a phrase that helped me at that moment (you are not your thoughts) to literally eliminate the physical symptoms I had even though those thoughts were still there. A few days after this I went to the psychiatrist to tell him exactly what I'm telling in this message and he told me about impulse phobias, I went home and a few days after this in the news of Antena 3 the typical ones that give at night well, they talked about a news of a boy with schizophrenia and well what happened to me is that I was literally shocked, I barely slept that night, literally hearing that it was like, I have this. I started looking for symptoms throughout the summer and a few more months, in total 4/5 followed day by day by Google, by YouTube videos of people with schizophrenia, videos about psychotic outbreaks, well from there I'm bad no, the following. I literally began to be aware of the sounds and what I saw and if I saw something out of the corner of my eye I scratched myself in case I was hallucinating or for example I was watching a video on YouTube of whatever and if I heard something that could be out of that video, I went back the video to see if I heard it again, that was an example of what I was doing, I was aware of what I saw or if I saw things out of the ordinary, I also read about delusions and paranoia and to give an example, read that these people think that They want to kill them and that from there I have thoughts of that style, although I know that they are a lie, in Spanish I've barely found information as if I've found it in English and they relate it to OCD, but literally sometimes I doubt that this can be OCD, this seems like something serious I'm afraid it's psychosis or schizophrenia I'm shit I need help, it seems that I'm delirious sometimes even though I know that certain thoughts are not logical... I think that reading symptoms has fucked my head because in my life I have had these thoughts."

Hey so I might be just overthinking and just writting words right now (I hope my spelling is okay), so sorry for just a confusing rant while I debate in my head, but, I‚Äôve been self harming for a long time now. I remmember my first cut and then the one that came after, I was 13 or 14 (I‚Äôm 17 now) when I started. I don‚Äôt recall being super upset or having any kind of breaking point. I tend to have some months break from SH and then I go back for like a week or more with maube a break of 3 days max. Ans two days ago I relapsed after being in a argument. I can never really pinpoint why I do it since its jot ALLWAYS emotional outbursts. I don‚Äôt feel like It‚Äôs to serious, but sometimes I do? It feels like I‚Äôm playing pingpong with my emotions, changing my opinion on my habbits daily allmost. I don‚Äôt want others to worry or feel bad for me so now after being caught once already by a parent I have gone to less noticble places. Maybe It‚Äôs some subconscious guilt that I can‚Äôt process at the moment, or I just don‚Äôt want to get into trubble. It‚Äôs not that I cut deep really or at any vital point. I just want to feel the sting. It bothers me mentally when I‚Äôm in public atleast this time since I did it on my shoulder (nobody sees but me and my friends tend to see allot of yellow cars haha). Anyways, sometimes I hurt myseld by emotional outbursts after bottling up, but more often I don‚Äôt have emotional outbursts while doing it, so maybe its boredom? Okay so real question is, can it all just be an addiction? If this counts as an addiction that is. Then again, if I wanted to stop already I would. While I don‚Äôt wanna stop I‚Äôm afraid tyat I might find someone who loves me in the future who gets scared off by my scars even if they‚Äôre not too bad. Currently my shoulder looks like its been attacked by a squirel, theres no way to exuse the wounds either unless I wanna blame my ‚Äúghost cats‚Äù. Anyways this whole thing might be too confusing to even awnser too, so I‚Äôm sorry about that,,, Also incase someone asks, yeah I have suecidal thoughts, but I‚Äôm not going anywhere, I‚Äôm too busy"

    "text": "Help me understand my mom Disclaimer: This is going to be a long post. I want to start by giving some background on my mom (72) and her relationships. My mom has always had a strong personality‚Äîloving, generous, and always putting others before herself. But she is also extremely authoritative, likes to control every situation, and is highly sensitive. If something upsets her, no matter how small, she will cut you off for weeks or even months. Apologizing is not in her vocabulary. My dad (80) has been the biggest victim of this dynamic. He is extremely servile, has a hearing problem, and sometimes just zones out‚Äîprobably to avoid unnecessary arguments. But even in the smallest things, she asserts control. The television remote, for example, belongs solely to her. If my dad tries to raise the volume so he can hear, her mood will turn sour instantly. She has always been strict and believes in correcting ‚Äúothers,‚Äù regardless of their age. She started her career as a disciplinarian at just 16 and was running a school at a very young age. People respected her‚Äînot just out of obligation, but because they truly admired her. Lately, her ability to handle disagreements has become unbearable. You cannot win an argument with her. She lacks the ability to resolve conflicts through communication, and it‚Äôs exhausting. I noticed a real shift in her personality after my grandmother passed away 12 years ago. My mom stayed by her side in the hospital for four straight years. Then, seven years ago, she lost her younger sister to lung cancer‚Äîa sudden battle that lasted only two months. That loss broke her. Since then, she has never been the same. She doesn‚Äôt enjoy anything anymore. She eats just to stay alive. Two months ago, she suffered a bad fall and bruised her face badly. Since then, her mood has been extremely low. She refuses to get a head scan because she no longer trusts doctors after everything she saw while caring for her mother. The past two months have made me see her differently. For most of my life, I‚Äôve seen her as this tough, unshakable force. But now, I can‚Äôt help but feel that her rigid personality is a shield‚Äîa defense mechanism to cope with deep trauma. And now, that shield is cracking. I don‚Äôt know how to help her, but I want to try. If anyone has experience with something like this, I‚Äôd appreciate your advice."

He is not well versed into DPDR or other dissociative disorders so he said he needs to do some research into it. I've been told by friends and my now ex girlfriend that I need serious therapy for a long time until I could recover and that's what I've been reading online.

From AI-powered therapy apps to VR-based exposure therapy, we are seeing innovations that were unimaginable a decade ago. Some emerging technologies that could revolutionize mental health in the next 5-10 years include: * **AI-driven mental health support:** AI chatbots and virtual therapists are improving, offering 24/7 support and personalized guidance. Could they complement or even replace traditional therapy in some cases? * **Neurotechnology & brain-computer interfaces:** With companies like Neuralink working on direct brain-computer interactions, could we see real-time mood regulation or AI-assisted cognitive therapy? * **VR & AR therapy:** Virtual reality is already being used to treat PTSD and anxiety through exposure therapy. How far can this go in making therapy more immersive and effective? * **Wearable mental health tracking:** Smartwatches and biometric sensors are evolving to track stress, mood, and even detect early signs of depression. Could this lead to proactive mental health interventions? * **Psychedelic-assisted therapy:** While not purely a tech innovation, AI and data-driven analysis could help optimize psychedelic treatments for mental health conditions like PTSD and depression. What do you think? Are there any technologies you believe will shape the future of mental health care? Or do you see risks in relying too much on technology for mental well-being?"

    "text": "My escape from reality and adding life to my days. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt add days to your life, but you can add life to your days‚Äù was what flipped the switch in my brain; I had gotten inti the rhythm of ‚Äúwake up, go to work, come home, sleep, repeat‚Äù and was feeling unfulfilled and depressed. What did I want, what made me happy, what was the reason to do any of it, what extra life could i stuff into my day? I like a lot of you love fantasy, I love the idea of adventures and exploring and after coming across videos of larping and reenactors I‚Äôve put a lot of effort into learning to hand sew to make my own kit, got back into archery because my favourite archetype is the Ranger, I‚Äôm making chainmaile, took up wood working for walking sticks, i plan to take up metal working for small buckles pins and jewelry. I have a minimalist camping trip this summer to get out of the city and just vibe in nature. I found a way to add life to my days that when I‚Äôm tired and sore i can still work towards a goal and regularly feel my dopamine spike when i see what I‚Äôve made. It was a hard and stressful start but after a year of small purchases I have a good base kit built up or still in progress, hope you can find the life you want to add to your days."

    "text": "I have an attraction to people who look like children, and I think I'm a pedo I am 17 and, in my school, there are people my age who look 14 and near those ages. But I get slammed for being attracted to them. I just find them pretty and like them but now all my friends hate me for this. Can someone just explain to me why its wrong, and what I should do. People say I'm a pedo for liking childlike features but how, is it not natural. Things I'm talking about are like smooth skin and being short. Part of this has to do with me being Muslim and the age of a child being after puberty rather than 18. But also, people hate me for not seeing what's wrong with the age gap. How was it okay for me to like someone who looks 14 when I was 14 but not when I'm older. What if I'm dating someone and I like pictures of them from the past. I don't want to be medicated either, if I do that I'll lose sexual attraction for people my age too. I've just seen this as natural. How am I supposed to suddenly find someone unattractive just from a few features. And why. I really have lost all my friends cause of this and it's making me want to not live anymore, but I can't do that. And no is giving me a clear answer on why its wrong."

    "text": "Is therapy working for me? I (30M) have been seeing my current therapist for about a year. He's a nice guy and a good listener. I just feel like our sessions aren't very productive. In a typical session, I spend the first 50 minutes telling him about how my week was (what happened, what feelings I experienced, how I dealt with them, and what lessons I feel like a learned about my mental health). He just listens, and basically he has just 10 minutes at the end to give me a little feedback. Basically, it feels like my therapist just listens to me psychoanalyze myself. Also, since I mostly talk about what happened over the past week, I feel like I am ultimately responding to symptoms rather than the root causes (I.e., unhealthy attitudes, character flaws, and mental conditions driving these behaviors). But of course I'm not the mental health professional. I'm not the one who's supposed to know *why* I have these problems. I expect my therapist to tell me what's wrong with me, but he mostly just listens to me talk during our sessions. And I'm not satisfied with the results I'm getting. Is there something I'm doing wrong? Is there something he's doing wrong? What should I expect from a therapist, and how can I get more out of this?"

    "text": "Would I be wrong to establish an ultimatum? I'm gonna try to word this carefully but please forgive me if my thinking is misinformed. I also want to preface this by saying I love my partner immensely and I just want her safe and healthy and able to live a somewhat normal life. My partner of 3 years struggles with BPD and has experienced a lot of trauma in her life. Over the past several months she's attempted suicide several times and she's been self harming. Each of these attempts resulted in her voluntarily admitting herself to a mental health facility but each time after a short while (2 weeks at most) she would check herself out, be doing ok for about a month, and then another attempt and another stint in a facility. Yesterday there was another attempt and she's currently staying with her dad because she wasn't admitted this time. I want a future with her, I want to have kids and a home and a real future but with this pattern it's not possible to have that. I'm considering establishing an ultimatum that she goes through a program at a mental health facility in full or I leave. I can't keep doing this, I can't keep seeing the love of my life destroy herself, and I can't have the future I want with her if she doesn't get the help she needs. Please, if you have a perspective on this that would be valuable or if you think I'm going about this the wrong way, voice that. This isn't something I'm accustomed to and the idea of an ultimatum seems unfair for me to impose but I don't know what else to do at this point and this is a last resort."

    "text": "Need help identifying my behaviour/mental health üíî This is my first time posting on reddit but I need help because I‚Äôm unable to reach a psychologist or any mental health professional because of financial issues and parents not believing bad mental health is an issue. I‚Äôm 16F. I‚Äôve had issues of mood for the past two years where I‚Äôd get highs of genuine happiness I‚Äôd be unable to sit still with high energy and would become extremely extroverted as well impulsively spend all my money although these highs only last a day or two. I‚Äôd get what I‚Äôd called depressive episodes where I feel so paralysed with sadness? I become very withdrawn from others and im unable to do any of my schooling or even the basics of taking care of myself. these episodes can last weeks or even to a month which was my longest. I feel emotions very severely too whenever I‚Äôm happy or sad I can feel it extremely. I‚Äôve always been ‚Äòsensitive‚Äô sometimes such minor situations can make me feel so strongly in response which I can‚Äôt help and it‚Äôs tiring to always feel things so intensively when I know it‚Äôs so minor. Ive always had a heavy distaste to schedules and planning only able to do things in the spur of the moment, as well Im heavily impulsive like I mentioned money wise and with my entire life. I‚Äôd make drastic changes to my life/myself just for the hell of it which would entail SH or life changes like changing schools just because I felt like it even though my life was perfectly balanced I always had issues with therapy as well every-time I get in I‚Äôd go in for a few sessions then eventually I‚Äôd think I‚Äôm magically cured and I wouldn‚Äôt need it anymore, many times I go through a phase of thinking I made it all up and I was just trying to be different. Only to crash into another depressive episode a week later and unable to function again. Hence it makes it hard to do therapy, no one is willing to stay around when I get into these switches. I‚Äôm only posting now because I‚Äôm struggling a lot with my emotions especially when I deal with love in my life it ties mostly into my strong feelings. I become very possessive and jealous it‚Äôs hard to control how I feel as well I constantly drift inbetween hating and loving the person I like?? Which is confusing I‚Äôm never able to be certain on someone I‚Äôm always drifting between strong emotions. I‚Äôve felt normal for some time not exactly overly sad or overly happy which I feel balanced but dealing with some overthinking. I‚Äôve found the only forced relief like medication, antidepressants helps but I find myself completely numb with no emotions which is relieving to not feel so much but I feel too empty unable to feel anything. As well smoking weed brings me a relief on my emotions and helps me relax. The only other opinion I‚Äôve gotten by a close friend is that they notice I had a tendency to quickly switch up quite a lot and they feel like I‚Äôm bipolar. I‚Äôm asking for an idea of what could align with this behaviour? I don‚Äôt want to self diagnose but I‚Äôm unable to get any mental health help. I‚Äôd like to be able to get some opinions. Very helpful if someone has any advice on how to handle behaviour like this? I want to improve but it feels very hard sometimes. (Sorry if my writing is chopped it‚Äôs lateüíî)"

    "text": "Should I get a new therapist? How can I keep being lazy? I honestly don't really feel like typing this cause I don't give a fuck. I'm just doing this because I feel obligated to \"try\".Well, not just, but that's the major reason. First question, should I change therapists? I have an art therapist, who has shown me compassion, and has tried for me, when no-one else has, or could. I'm in a dysfunctional and I guess..., neglectful household? We're all kinda fucked so no-one can give real compassion or empathy. I used to even abuse people so they would feel what I felt so they would know I was upset, but then I'd feel bad. I now realise I was trying to artificially create some kind of empathy. I'm 15 now, turning 16 soon, yaaaay... anyways, Ive bonded with my therapist, she really, truely cares for me, I guess even more than me or my mother. This has led me to has an emotional attachment, but the thing is, I don't think having someone who cares is enough. I need real extensive care, but I also can't throw her away. I can feel myself shutting down, I can feel my Brain shutting down. I've lost urgency, passion, and more. I already know that those are privileged feelings, so I shouldn't be that shocked, but the thing is, through everything, those feelings were my wavering flame of hope. Maybe this is me healing. Maybe because I'm not in survival mode and I'm healing, my main system shut down and is only allowing my other systems to come on one at a time. But I don't have time to waste, I dont have a person to find day to day comfort in and support, someone to hold my hand while I learn to walk like a baby again. I can't afford this. I transferred to another form of education but it's been months and I haven't touched my computer. The government's getting pissed, and I'm being pushed by everyone and everything. I'm but a head floating above the rapidly rising water in a closed tank with a sealed on lid. I tell people I want to get better, I tell them I need a break and thier only response is \"how can we get you back on track\". Back on track? I can't feel passion or hope or urgency, but I suffer knowing it's there and unreachable. I don't want to burn myself out, to the point that when I get space to rest, my little flame hides and leaves me in the dark. It's still in me, wavering and scared and passionate, and bright and I can't find it. I've lost a part of myself, and all they want is results. What can I do? I couldn't even write a schedule or re-order the to do notes Ive been writing down for over a year and never completing. I have spilled my body in the form of tears with the smell of blood, in front of others for half ass responses. They say all I need is for someone to point me in the right direction, and that could've worked, at one point. But now searching stuff up is too hard, caring is too hard, being vulnerable, is too hard. I want to be happy. But the push and the shove, push and shove. I got off topic. Next question, how do I stay lazy? How can I avoid life? Im only a teenage, if there's one point in life I should be able to rest without worrying about bills and jobs, should it not be now? Do I have to be admitted into a mental hospital? Am I going through enough to be admitted? Are they going to treat me bad? What do I do."

    "text": "Fear of my friends reaction due to people pleasing This has been weighing on me, and I need some outside opinions. For context, I'm turning 20 soon. When I was 16, 1 became best friends with a girl named Stacey. We were close up until the spring of my junior year (I was 17). Around that time, I was in a toxic situationship with an older drug dealer named jack. It wasn't even a real relationship, but I was trauma-bonded to him. During spring break, Stacey confessed that she had slept with jack and profusely apologized. At first, I accepted her apology, but after a week, I couldn't even bear looking at her. Eventually, I cut her off completely. My three best friends supported me through the whole thing and also stopped being friends with her out of loyalty to me. Fast forward to now: Stacey reached out to me last fall with a long, heartfelt apology. After thinking about it for a while, I decided to forgive her. Since then, we've been in nonstop contact-texting, calling, and rebuilding our friendship. She's actually moving back to Florida (where I live) this Monday, and we'll probably start hanging out again. The problem? I haven't told my three best frie yet. I know they're going to have strong opinion because they cut Stacey off for me back then. One of them knows Stacey apologized but assumes we only follow each other now. Another knows she reached out but bashed her immediately, so I never told him we stayed in contact. The third has no idea about any of it. I feel nervous, even though I know I'm allowed to make my own choices. I chose to forgive her because l've grown, I believe people change, and I don't want to hold onto anger over something that happened when we were teenagers. I'm also a Christian, and I believe in second chances. My parents and boyfriend support my decision, but I feel like I owe my friends an explanation because of how much they supported me in the past. I considered just posting a photo of Staceyand me without saying anything, but I worry that would blindside them. On the other hand, I don't want to send a dramatic message and make it seem like I'm asking for their approval. So, Reddit-how do I approach this? Should I tell them individually, send a short group message or just post and let them react? Any advice isappreciated."

I was offended at that but didn't really care until my mother supported her. Now I know I have a decently high level of emotional intelligence, considering a few years ago I was in an incredible depressed/suicidal state and I swore to myself that I would make sure that me and those around me would feel heard/appreciated and understood. My mother knows this and that I'm actively in therapy and despite that, still agreed with my aunt. I know that she doesn't really know my personal life all that well, but you'd think that one of the few confidants I have would be able to recognize the amount of work I put in to try and understand people. For her of all people to essentially say that I don't understand people is incredibly hurtful as it pretty much invalidates the past 3 years of my life. Now I'm disappointed in her but because of trauma, I'm not sure how to communicate that."

I had dressed myself nicely, it was a girl i always talked to, whenever, even when i was sick to the point of dropping on the ground. She was a Friend of mine, \"we\" used to talk a lot at school, but it seem like she didn't wanna talk to me that much after i confessed. She was always so happy around my friends, not even bothering to talk to me, apart for important things. I always took care of her, she was always sick, so i gived her food when i had it, when she sat alone, because she didn't pay for the cafetaria and all her friends where there, i always asked my friends if i could go join her not to let her alone. I always did my best, texting her everyday, if i did not she wouldn't even text back. At one point, i understood, that i was only clowning myself, so, i just abandonned, and she didn't even care, maybe i'm not such a great person, was i too selfish? Was not enough? Even though she knew. She seemed more interested by my friend, and he didn't even like her. But i did, and i always do. I guess i'm probably just a clown in her life, in my life aswell, i wish i just didn't fall in love, because, i'm just destroying myself. Or was i already destroyed inside? I truly hate myself, i always had this thought that maybe am not cut for this, i would have abandonned sooner, but this damn habit of mine, wanting to not abandon, i probably should not have risen up back when i was kid, i should have learned to abandon. When i texted her, today, saying that, she really didn't seem to care about our conversation online, she was dry, and didn't even seem to want to respond, i just sayed that it's okay, i don't hate her, i hate myself, because i know im probably not interesting, boring, ugly, i can't even define myself. I probably just want to die, listen to this voice in the back of my head. But what will it change, dead or alive, i'm still a clown. I had everything, a good life, parents, friends, family, i'm sprotif (volleyball), i learn piano, i write novels, i read. But it seems like it will never be enough, but i can't forget her, because she was my everything. We weren't in couple, yet i was jealous, but what could i do? Just continue hating myself for bot being enough for someone? I wish i wasn't born, if it was to never be loved, and only the person to love, what was my purpose? That's one of my stupid questions. But i must continue, because i know damn right my parents fought to give me a future, they didn't have the childhood i had, yet they gave it to me. Yet, yes, yet, i always wonder if i should be around, i always wonder if im loved, if my presence brighten someone day. I always wonder if i matter. Because i know damn right the world will continue to turn even if i'm gone right? Then maybe i'm not needed, i always wonder if i should just disappear."

    "text": "Does anyone feel the same way? I feel so alone with my struggles. Hi everyone, I'm 24 years old, living in Germany, and I‚Äôve been struggling with severe depression and generalized anxiety disorder (diagnosed) for a long time. I have no contact with my family and live alone. Even though I meet up with friends regularly‚Äîfor example, going on nature walks‚ÄîI often still feel incredibly lonely. Communication is hard for me, and my mind constantly feels foggy, making it difficult to think, speak, or even write clearly. Physically, I experience symptoms like heart palpitations, dizziness while walking, tinnitus, muscle pain, tension, and twitching. My sleep is completely irregular, and I often feel extreme exhaustion. Some days, I don‚Äôt eat properly and just scroll on my phone for hours, like when i wake up i'm on IG and scrolling for almost 1-2 hours before i actually wake up. I struggle with keeping up with daily tasks, and appointments stress me out so much that I often avoid them. I started outpatient therapy, but I was told that it likely wouldn‚Äôt be effective for me. Since then, I‚Äôve barely seen a doctor because I‚Äôm terrified of being diagnosed with something serious. I‚Äôve always had a strong tendency toward hypochondria, and I constantly worry about my health. At the same time, I also experience existential fears‚Äîfinancial struggles, feeling stuck in life, and an overwhelming fear of the future. Some days, I think about death as a relief, even though I don‚Äôt actually want to die, i'm actually scared to die. After my last real relationship ended (2years ago), my mental health declined a lot. I started smoking heavily (14-15 cigarettes a day, sometimes even more) and drinking regularly on weekends with friends and going to parties. I don't do that anymore regularly, instead we meet for hiking, but I still feel like I‚Äôm just stuck in a cycle‚Äîspending five days at home doing nothing but being on the PC sometimes playing the piano and gaming with friends, feeling overwhelmed by even the smallest tasks, and being afraid to go outside alone. I know I need to change something, but I feel like my body is made of lead, and everything is just too overwhelming. I often have disturbing dreams, feel emotionally unstable, and struggle with feelings of anger, frustration, and worthlessness. I worry a lot about what others think of me and fear that people notice how bad I actually feel. I guess I just need to hear from someone who understands. Are there others here who feel the same way? Or has anyone been in a similar situation and found a way to cope? I don‚Äôt need criticism‚ÄîI already know I‚Äôm struggling. I just want to feel less alone in this. Thank you for reading."

    "text": "I don't know what to do anymore. (Using a throwaway as my friends+mom know and follow my main account.) I've never had it diagnosed but I know I have *some* kind of anxiety problem. I have been absolutely TERRIFIED of losing my teeth/having them rot out for as long as I can remember. I distinctly remember losing my first baby tooth and I had what I can only describe as an anxiety attack and not telling my parents because I was so scared. I'm 16 now and I've only been to the dentist once in my life, at 7. Another problem is that, and I'm not sure why, but my parents had never really done very much to make sure me or my siblings really took care of our dental health, which I think has made it just become worse with time. So there was no 'brush your teeth before bed, brush your teeth in the morning' sort of thing, or going to the dentist, and I'm imagining most parents *make* their kids do it. And that's not really to say that this is entirely their fault because I love my parents so much and I honestly do think most of this is probably my fault. Only saying that it let me get away with never brushing my teeth as a kid, even if I knew I should have been. I didn't brush my teeth because I was too scared to do it (I started doing it every day right after I turned 13 though, so that was pretty big for me). So it eventually became all I thought about every day. My parents knew about this since I was pretty young, I've told them on several occasions about just how truly bad it is, and I don't know why but it just never came up to do anything about the underlying mental issue. My teeth have never looked great. They're not rotted black or anything quite as extreme as that but they don't look nice and I keep getting afraid that they will eventually get to that point. I can't laugh or smile without thinking about how awful I must look. Last year I spent my entire summer rotting in my room from the anxiety because I *thought* I saw something black on a molar (It doesn't look like that anymore, I believe it was in my head or something to that effect). It took months of building up courage but I finally told my mom that I wanted to go to the dentist again, she said she'd look into it, and it's been 8 months, she hasn't done anything. In the last month or so the anxiety has gotten worse and I feel a little resentful that she hadn't done anything when I asked, because I keep telling her I have a problem and I keep getting anxiety attacks. I don't want to resent her, I love her, but sometimes I can't help feeling the urge to blame her for everything. She's a forgetful person and I know I should ask again but it took me two and a half months to even find the courage to talk about it the first time and I still get so anxious just thinking about it that I just have so much doubt that I'll even do it at this point. I don't even know how I'd get through a dentist visit, I feel like I'd actually have to be put unconscious or something. I feel like I should have done things different and then none of this would be happening. I almost feel like it's ruined my life because I don't know if there's ever been a single day that has gone by where I don't think about this and just feel hopeless. It gets hard to keep telling them I need help and they do nothing. All this to say that I'd appreciate any kind of encouragement or whatever positivity/advice anybody has to throw my way because I don't really have friends to talk to about this and I really need it right now. Thank you :)"

I don't know which sub is best to talk about it, but since my mental health is getting worse because of this, I'm keeping hope here. The thing is, I have a nephew who is about a year and a half old. I'm not close to the baby's parents and I still live here with my family, but I'm working on leaving, because it is an environment that is very bad for me. And he (the baby) lives next door and is extremely close to us. I kept this to myself for a few months because it's something extremely difficult to say. But for a few months now I've been on high alert every time my mom picks up the baby. I don't like the way she holds him, because it seems like she always does everything to touch his private parts. And I'm going crazy not knowing if this is just my head being paranoid, because, well, she's my mother! It's hard to believe that she, no matter how bad she is, would do something like that. Maybe it's without realizing it, maybe she's not being malicious, but the fact is that being so aware of this is bothering me. I can't talk to anyone about it and I can't, mainly because it could be the purest madness in my head and accusing my own mother seems insane. And I already told her, but just scolded me saying that I get irritated by everything. I Just don't know what to do, or with it can be real ou just my mind doing it looks worst. I want to protect him, but I want to get out from here as fast as I can, and I literally fell that I simply couldn't talk about it to anyone, and the baby's parents are irresponsible teenagers who wouldn't listen to me and wouldn't do anything, and wouldn't even know what to do."

I was in an 8 year relationship with the most amazing girl I‚Äôve ever met. When Covid hit, I gained a lot of weight and became anxious all the time. This affected my self esteem a lot. I felt embarrassed and ashamed of both my anxiety and weight gain, bc they were clear indicators I had given up. I leaned too much on my fianc√© during this time, but I managed to lose the weight and start lexapro, which helped my anxiety so much. However, a month into starting lexapro I lost my mother to cancer. Her death was traumatic and awful. Seeing her that sick for 8 months changed me, and watching her die changed me even more. I always pretended i was fine, but the truth is I never found the old me. I gained the weight back, I stopped caring about myself. I started finding anyway possible to distract myself, but what I didn‚Äôt realize at the time is that it pushed me further away from my fianc√©. I stopped trying and the relationship grew boring. She was by my side the whole time through everything, and that‚Äôs how I thanked her. By becoming distant and losing my spark and what made me, me. Losing the love of my life really opened my eyes. I‚Äôve barely eaten in a week, and I don‚Äôt ever want to get out of bed. My whole world is shattered. This time, I can‚Äôt let it permanently break me even more. I have to get up and fight. I have to love myself again. I have to heal. I‚Äôve beeen through a lot, but I will pick myself back up, and this time, I have to do it alone. I need to rediscover the old me, the me before the trauma of the last few years. I‚Äôm going to start with exercise, eating healthy, and making new friends. I have to put myself out there and be happy again. Before the last few years, I was always social and loved life. I turned into someone who is just surviving. I know I‚Äôm just venting, but if anyone here has any recommendations for me on where to start, or even any books I can read to help change my thought process and get in touch with my happiness again, please share them. I am finally ready to heal."

But, I feel so exhausted all the time. I push myself to step out but after ten minutes I am feeling low energy again... This triggers my anxiety disorder because I think that there's something so wrong with me and none of the doctors can pick up on it. How do I get out of this feeling? I do exercise but excerising also makes me feel sleepy. The only condition I haven't checked for yet is ADHD, but if I do have it, it hasn't affected my past. I have been able to complete my education, hold a career and family. I do get patchy sleep at night and this has been an ongoing struggle for the past six years. Could tiredness be related to depression? Should I push myself to get out of the house? What do I do if I sleepy in public spaces such as malls?

I grew up poor with a dad who abused drugs and an alcoholic stepdad after that who repeated the worst things you could ever say to a child would break my belongings and throw me into walls until I was old enough to fight him back. I was SA'd as a child and again when I turned 19 after being spiked at a club. I'm gay and trans (which I know not everyone stands for and it's easy to say \"then just don't be\") but it's another added stresser to my life. Lately I feel like I can't go on anymore, I'm sick of having nothing to my name I have a lovely partner but even they started to crack under my depression and anxiety and I feel like cutting her loose to save her the pain and honestly myself the effort of acting like a decent person and giving her attention/support when tbh I'm really not capable. I have a lot of anger issues a lot of crying impulses all the time. I'm medicated but therapy is too expensive to keep up and I feel better for a while till I don't anymore. I feel like my meds aren't really working anymore if I feel this way but I can't afford a psychiatric consultation either and honestly I'm just done with it. I don't make art, I don't have a career path I can follow, I never finished highschool I'm just an all around fuck up and where I live there's no such thing as a GED exam I'd have to study and work both full time which I really am not capable of. I'm sick and tired of being the sad friend, I don't want to make myself the victim but I've always fought against the odds I've been supporting myself since I was 15 and I'm already so tired the idea of doing this for god knows how many years seems so unnecessary, like for what? For who? I have nothing of my own. Is this an age thing did you feel this lost at 25/26 what do you do about it when all your energy is being used to survive so you never get to live? Nothing feels fun anymore, I don't want to see friends for fear that I'm always the pain with nothing good to give. I'm pushing myself to be in charge of activities in my community and help out others in need and all that but nothing is fulfilling anymore. Sorry for being really sad, I'm trying my best but I feel like my body has given up on me I'm holding down a job now but I have to go cry in the bathroom every few hours so I can pretend I'm ok, if I don't get this money I won't have rent and food so. What do I do? What helps? Will this pass? Do I just keep fighting even tho it feels pointless? With the state of the world as it is there's no real future I can look forward to even"

I've done entire diets and plans and eaten whole foods for LONG stretches. I worked out, did cardio and weight lifting. And while I have retained a LOT of muscle, the fat was still there. In the last year I lost enough weight that my clothes stopped fitting, people noticed and then i gained some back. I have once again dropped more and feel gross. My body is this weird mix of buff and obese, but also what looks like loose skin. I HATE my reflection now, and don't know how my wife can stand me. For awhile it brought me to suicidal thoughts, and it hasn't stopped. To be clear I don't hate obese people. I don't know why, but this has RUINED my mental health. I did hear something from a doctor awhile back about my thyroid being slow or something, but I was broke then. I'm considering going to a doctor now and getting looked at. Idk, if anyone else can relate or has thyroid issues, I'd love to hear. Have a great weekend!"

    "text": "Am I depressed ? I‚Äôve been reading a lot about ‚Äúfunctional depression‚Äù and about how depressed people are not necessarily sad and I‚Äôm questioning if I might be depressed myself. I have a job that I enjoy in my family‚Äôs company, I have a boyfriend who lives in a different country and we see each other often and I really enjoy spending time with him. I love literature and I read a lot, staying informed, watching films and travelling. I have 5/6 friends that I see frequently. However I‚Äôm generally a ‚Äúlazy‚Äù person. I love staying at home a lot, by myself. I see my friends at least once or twice a week but I prefer an early drink or a dinner, I absolutely refuse to go out late and party (I‚Äôm 27) even though I am and always been a night person. I never go to bed before 2am and when I can I wake up late. I feel like I stay in bed way more than the average person. When I work from home I sometimes stay in my bed. And my favourite part of the day is taking my make up off, showering, putting my pyjamas and just saying in bed reading, watching YouTube etc. I sometimes struggle to get out of the bed in the morning, when I don‚Äôt have a reason to leave the bed, like going to the office or some other engagement, my instinct is to just stay in bed and have a lazy morning scrolling on tik tok, watching a film or reading. Then around 11:30 I usually work out, shower and become more active, but I kinda always have to fight a little with my lazyness. In general if it‚Äôs not something that I really have to do like work or health stuff I often (not always) have to push myself a little to go out. Once I‚Äôm out having a drink with a friend or going to an exhibition I‚Äôm at ease and I like it, but I do also feel a sense of relief when I‚Äôm going back home, I‚Äôm hardly ever the one who pushes people to stay more or do something else. The only mental issue that I consciously have is anxiety. When I have something big coming at work I want to get it done and over it because I feel the pressure and the responsibility a lot, but it‚Äôs not overwhelming, I usually manage it and it pushes me to get the stuff done. I‚Äôm not the most energetic and smiley person in the world. I definitely have a negative outlook sometimes and I can get sad from time to time. But most of the time I like my life, I feel lucky. What do you think?"

I think I have it in my head that being a narcissist is just feeling like that every day. Is there a reason for this?"

Ive pushed all my friends away because I'm a piece of garbage that gets jealous of you getting slightly more attention than me and I'm so ungodly petty over the most pointless garbage. I've been TRYING to find people to be around but I'm so anxious ALL THE TIME. And i just realized a few weeks ago that I (a guy) likes dressing in womens clothes which makes it worse. I never go out besides going to work since there's nothing fun to do anywhere remotely close to me. Literally the only thing I want right now is someone to cuddle with and talk to. THATS LITERALLY IT AND ITS THE ONE THING I CANT HAVE. The only thing keeping me alive at this point is that there's a chance I might find someone eventually. The second I lose that chance, I'm not sure i could keep going. Sorry if I'm just talking nonsense but I needed to get this out or I was gonna lose it."

    "text": "When do you guys 'prefer' to take your meds? - specifically psychiatric drugs - all responses welcome! \\*Not entirely necessary to read the entire post - I know it's lengthy\\* Right out of the gate: Male, 33, Bipolar 1 and ADHD dual diagnosis. I've been on a 'cocktail' of medications for around 13 years that seems to work great with my specific treatment. Over the years, under my Drs supervision, I've played around with the times I take them - AM/PM - obviously, I am not talking about medications with time related specifications. I take Lithium, Lamictal, and Seroquel XR to address Bipolar and Vyvanse for ADHD. The dosage has been tweaked over the years as needed. Initially, I took the Lithium and Lamictal in the AM and the Seroquel XR in the PM which, for me, was obvious since its sedating effects were the only thing allowing me to sleep. Along with the obvious Vyvanse in the AM. In the past few years I've made some adjustments: I started taking the Lithium in the PM with my Seroquel XR and keeping the Lamictal in the AM. My reasoning was two-fold: 1) the Lithium - while extremely effective - seemed to cause mild 'brain fog' and lethargy. 2) Due to the fact that Lithium is hard on the kidneys my Dr suggested taking it in the PM to lesson the strain put on them by also having to work through the digestion of the other stuff your consuming during the day. Which would also potentially address issue #1 - and it seemed to do so. In the last year I also switched to taking the Lamictal in the PM - which, from what I've read and have heard from other people on it, is common and the 'typical' suggested time anyhow. For me, I think the main reason for transitioning to PM was pure practicality - take them all at one time. I have been EXTREMELY fortuante and, even though I've been on these meds for years, have experienced little to no negative side effects. What times do you take your meds? If you feel comfortable: what were some of the main reasons. Everyone is different and should do what works best for them so there is no room for judgement!"

I feel dumb and I‚Äôve failed 2 exams for the first time in my life. I feel like no one will ever have any reason to love me anymore. My whole life people only loved me because of my looks, from creepy old men to my classmates, every confession I‚Äôve had was because I was pretty. But when I finally got it together I finally got a letter complimenting how smart I was. It was a feeling I could never forget. Ever since then I‚Äôve worked hard on my looks and even harder in my studies. I know I‚Äôm nothing but a pretty face without it. I hate this feeling but I absolutely detest the thought of being unattractive in other peoples eyes as well, I hate the feelings when people dislike me even if I have to go to extreme lengths to keep an image. I know you must think I‚Äôm just a fake dumb person. But I have no other person to tell this too, it is killing me so much. I can only be myself at home, and I‚Äôm not even at home anymore, I‚Äôm so stupidly exhausted. I just want to go home and cry in my mom‚Äôs arms but I know they must want for me to be happy, under no circumstances will I ever tell them.

I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety, and I feel like I‚Äôve been struggling with this for as long as I can remember. Even back in 6th grade, I had the same overwhelming feelings. I come from a toxic family‚Äîmy mom has narcissistic tendencies, and my dad constantly plays the victim while badmouthing everyone around him. They manipulate in their own ways. They‚Äôve been separated for almost five years now, and even though things got better at first, it‚Äôs getting worse again. They absolutely hate each other. On top of that, we have financial problems, and my mom keeps pushing me to get a job. But I feel like I just can‚Äôt. I have no motivation, no energy‚ÄîI feel like I‚Äôm stuck in a hole I can‚Äôt climb out of. I‚Äôm 18 now, and I always thought I wouldn‚Äôt make it past 18. I never planned for anything beyond this point. Now I‚Äôm here, and everything just feels empty. I failed my exams, so I have to decide whether to retake school or do something else, but I don‚Äôt even know what I‚Äôm capable of anymore. I‚Äôm currently doing an internship, but after that, I have no idea what comes next. It all just feels pointless. I take medication for my depression, but let‚Äôs be honest‚Äîno pills can fix a toxic environment. I want to move out so badly, but I have no money, no job, no plan. My mom constantly stresses me out, and my brother doesn‚Äôt really care‚Äîhe‚Äôs the ‚Äúgolden child‚Äù who can do no wrong. I think I‚Äôm my dad‚Äôs favorite, but that just means he uses me as his emotional dumping ground, and I can‚Äôt handle that either. I‚Äôve considered hospitalization, but what would that even change? My mom doesn‚Äôt believe in mental health issues, and my dad would just make it weird. My brother is younger than me, and I don‚Äôt want to burden him with this. I just don‚Äôt see a way out. I believe in God and try to remind myself that there‚Äôs a plan for me, but I don‚Äôt know what it is. I just want to be happy like everyone else. I don‚Äôt know why I have to suffer like this when I‚Äôve done nothing to deserve it. I‚Äôve been in therapy for two years, and my therapist is kind and understanding, but at the end of the day, she can‚Äôt change my home life. I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. If anyone has any advice or has been through something similar, please, I‚Äôd really appreciate hearing from you."

My past semesters were beyond hard but I had a partner who would help until we broke up at the end of last year. Diagnosed with persistent depressive disorder (I think I may be borderline) and anxiety. I‚Äôve had very significant suicidal ideations for weeks but am too afraid. Last month i would constantly day dream about ending things. I was getting through my depression with music until I experienced hearing loss and tinnitus from noise overexposure and its made my life completely unbearable. I normally cope with my issues via music and smoking but neither is possible with my extreme tinnitus. It‚Äôs become nearly impossible to do my school work with my head noise. I‚Äôm beyond behind in school and have never cared less. I used pride myself on my hard work and intelligence but I can‚Äôt help but sob every morning I wake up. Trash and clothing from over a month has piled up to the point where I‚Äôm stepping over it and tripping in my bedroom and bathroom. I‚Äôm estranged from most of my family, already being extremely lonely and having the only two people in my life leave me on read when expressing my distress has made everything more severe. I feel terrible about myself now and feel like I want to rip out of my skin. I would do anything to have someone to call to help me eat or clean. The only strength I can muster is to show up my classes (FAFSA is the only reason I can afford school) and work as I‚Äôve stopped working at my part time for near a month and have called out too many times at my full time that I risk getting in trouble. I already had to beg one teacher to extend a deadline that is worth 20% of my grade til Monday and I cannot get myself to do any of it. I haven‚Äôt genuinely laughed in weeks and have been constantly playing a character to not throw everybody off. I‚Äôve been experiencing extreme agitation and mood swings for weeks now. Going days between showers and meals has become my norm. When I look in the mirror I cry from shame or don‚Äôt feel real at all. People around me think of me highly because of my hard work so now I feel like a complete failure. I‚Äôm hesitating to go to a hospital as I‚Äôm not sure what will happen to my schooling and the last thing I can do in this economy is owe FAFSA money. I feel like I might benefit psych ward as I am unable to care for myself. I am highly worried about being turned away for not being suicidal enough/ not being considered in crisis. A lot of people on here speak about how awful wards can be but I‚Äôm not sure I can take another day of living in so much emotional pain that my chest and muscles ache. I am concerned with my ear issues that being at the ward will destroy my ears. I spent every break at work crying today. I‚Äôm so burnt out but I have to pay my bills and it feels like the only purpose or goal I have in life is to receive an education. The ringing in my head everyday is painful. Any advice is deeply appreciated."

I have failed tests, exams, classes, and have even been suspened because of my problem. But the thing is and I have voiced this many times to professionals, is that I don't feel like it's anxiety. I know there can be many symptoms for it but I feel like I don't fall into any of them and I would tell people whether it's my doctor or my grandmother (she has had terrible anxiety for her whole life and she is an amazing person to talk to) and they would just say well it probably is anxiety. Because of this, I never know how to help myself when I go into bad episodes. Funf act actually, I don't even have an offical anxiety diagnosis. Anyway, I have just found out that my mother's insurance that she gets from her job will cover about 80% of the cost for a psychology diagnostic exam and we can finally pay for it!!! Sadly I have to wait until the fall because since I am graduating high-school next year, the universites where I live require like a note of a diagnosis within 12 months of graduating but it's better than nothing! I am so extremely happy that I may find out what's wrong with me and how I can help myself!!!!"

I just want to know why i do this and i want to stop it because it's getting out of hand..."

    "text": "How do i stick to my word? To start this off, I have a long history of substance abuse, pushing past limits many would go to. Whether it was getting caught high in school way too many times, getting so drunk i threw up on myself and got expelled, or even overdosing on opioids and putting my family through hell and back with hospital bills. At the end of the day i don‚Äôt know how to help myself. I tell so many people i‚Äôm finally getting sober, and somehow end up relapsing and it all goes down hill. I have an amazing girlfriend who over the past year has pushed me to become a better person. She is everything i could ever ask for, and i don‚Äôt want to better myself just for her, i want it for the both of us. I have been sober lately, but i‚Äôm terrified of another relapse. I think about it like, i would want a healthy and happy partner, who isn‚Äôt consumed by drugs, and i know she would expect the same. I know nobody can help me but myself, and nobody is watching my every moment to force me to do better, but i would like some coping skills i can really stick to. I know there‚Äôs probably many people on here who have struggled with similar situations. I don‚Äôt want this to be some long essay someone‚Äôs gonna scroll past, but i‚Äôm a highschool kid who can‚Äôt stick to something he wants so badly for himself. I‚Äôve always struggled with failure and i want this to be something i succeed in. I mean atleast i want help for myself and that‚Äôs the first step. But at the end of the day it‚Äôs stupid to sit here and ask for help while i know nobody can truly help. Thank you to everyone reading this with an open mind and genuine advice, stay safe."

I feel broken and alone like im missing a piece of me, i know there will be no others like him and it makes me uncontrollably angry and frustrated. It feels like the world is against me, he was so young and it happened out of nowhere. I dont feel like eating or really doing anything. I feel like i keep seeing him in the corner of my eye just to look and see an empty space where he used to sit. Why do other peoples cats get to live 20+ years but my Best friend and only thing that was helping me move along has to die young. I feel angry at god for the circumstances, i feel angry at myself for not savoring every moment with himself, i cant think of anything else but him. At least i have the photos and videos of him to look back on, and a voice recording of his purring. Today was the worst day of my life"

I've spoken about many things across two different accounts like how I can't seem to keep friends and people have gotten close to me just to leave or treat me like I'm disposable. I've done all the right things. I'm going to therapy, I'm going to the gym, I'm meditating and looking inwards and sometimes all this works but then nights like tonight happen where it's just not working. I'm sad. I'm really sad. So many people left that I'm still struggling with leaving and I don't feel like I have anyone to be on my side anymore. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. When people ask for space, I give them space; when people need help, I'm willing to help. I feel like I'm a nice enough person but no one can seem to stand with me platonically or otherwise beyond just temporary entertainment before moving onto something else. It's driving me crazy. There's some people in particular that come to mind that I can't help but wish I never got to know them in the first place. They got close to me, made me feel safe and happy, and then they left. I've tried to respect their wishes but I'm so tired of falling for that trap. It's making me feel cold and closed off from anyone else. When I think about it sometimes, it's like this last year just isn't real. I don't get it. I want to shut it all off. I want these feelings to stop so I can just enjoy myself again. I'm self-sufficient and can do this on my own but that doesn't mean it's a pleasant experience at all. Being alone is awful and I wish I could shut off that feeling so bad. I'm so tired and I don't know how I'm going to dig myself out of this."

    "text": "Healthy Diet is Affecting My Mental Health? Hello, I (34M) recently decided that I needed to start working on being healthier and lose some weight. Based on professional Medical assessments I need to lose almost 200 pounds. I also have been diagnosed with ADHD, Depression, and Anxiety. Personally I love to cook and try new recipes I love to make and eat super delicious food. I love cooking so much that I make 90% of the meals for my household. Now I may be totally off base here, but I think a big part of my overeating problem stems from the dopamine I get from eating tasty food. Once I really started tracking what I've been eating I noticed I used to eat/snack almost constantly. Now I am trying really hard to reduce my calorie intake because I have almost no time for exercise so the entire calorie deficit has to be diet based. So that means I eat less tasty food, less frequently, and in lower amounts. Which so far does seem to be helping me shed some weight. (13 pounds in 3 weeks) But my side affect is that I feel like I'm spiraling. Even on great days I feel so down. I have seen/heard that ADHD can cause problems with our dopamine reception. Maybe that's totally wrong and if so please correct me. But it seems like I just can't seem to stop spiraling ever since I started eating less. I feel like I have to lose the weight because it's dangerous to my health to be so heavy, but I also feel like if I can't stop this spiral it will also be dangerous. So friends what do I do now? Any tips or tricks that you may have found to help? TLDR: I'm afraid that I was getting all my dopamine from overeating. Now that I'm not overeating I feel like mentally I'm spiraling."

    "text": "Any of you has this problem? (Movies, tv shows, videos, books) I used to start and finish books in just a couple of days when I was younger, i was pretty proud of being a reader, of having so many books that I could recall loving. I'm 24 and I might not be too old but now I can't even read a page most of the times. My mind goes blank, i can't fully understand the sentences, no pictures forming in my mind, no excitement, nothing. I could read 10 pages and then realize I didn't absorb a single thing. Then read it again, get exhausted and leave it to never touch it again. It's similar with movies and tv shows, although I can be idealizing the past with my nostalgia and forgetting about those recent times I was fully present. I feel like nothing excites me anymore. When I watch stuff with other people I can't recall the storyline, it's not fun to discuss a movie with me, it's awful and painful. I miss so many details that it's like I wasn't there, and in these occasions I can asure you my eyes are only on the screen. It feels so awful that I don't even want to get invited , I hate getting recommendations, to feel that pressure of having to watch something that yes, I could like, but no, I won't finish, won't make me feel that excitement I used to get (or i think i used to get, I'm not sure, maybe it wasn't never there). And by the way, there's nothing wrong with the people who recommends me stuff, I understand why they do it and that this is a me problem. Why does this happens? Does anybody get this? Not only this lack of attention and interest, but also this thought of idealizing the past, remembering in a way that you're not sure it was real."

He love bombs me, but not in an unhealthy manner (he just is very positive all the time...almost toxically positive at times)....and that makes me uncomfortable, but not for the reason you think. It makes me uncomfy bc my husband had been so so abusive and has told me over and over that I am worthless and a piece of garbage ... And his actions had said the same. He didn't physically abuse me past the time I had hauled off and hit him back, but he had still abandoned me and the kids, even tho he was still there. I hate him so fucking much...but I love him so fucking much more...even tho he's gone. I will never get to tell him how much I fucking hate him. How much he fucked my life up forever by being such a piece of SHIT GARBAGE human to me and his own fucking KIDS...they didn't do ANYTHING to you, and they didn't deserve your fucking disinterest and hate. Anyway, this guy is the exact opposite of that. No matter how much I push him away, he is still there supporting me and never EVER judging me. But ... Here is the problem ... I can't love him like that. I can't...after what I've gone thru for the last half of my marriage and then all this bullshit going on in our country AND having fucking CANCER...I can't open my heart. I feel like it has been cemented closed, and no amount of TNT will break through it. I want to reach out and love him, but idk ... I can't feel a spark. Not anymore? When we first started talking on Reddit, I was still okay-ish mentally. Now ... My physical health has plummeted and my mental health is almost at crisis levels bc of the stress of possibly LOSING MY ONLY INCOME. We will be homeless and we will starve if that happens...I won't be able to treat my cancer... I need some young people on here to give me guidance. I don't know how to let him in with how I'm struggling right now. He is so accepting of all my kids (not that it really was a factor in becoming involved with him, but it IS a nice perk!) and of all my bullshit. My mood swings ... All of it.üòì Even when I'm so mean to him ... He stays. (I apologize no worries, and I try to hold my tongue when I know I can't be an adult about something. Sigh... Sorry to vent to y'all. I just am stuck and I can't break this shell I've built around me and I don't want to...not even with this guy who is nothing but good and loving to me. Help? I don't really want any kind of binding relationship ...but ... I'm also longing for connection...but what kind of connection...? How much? How to go about this? What if I say something or do something that scares him away? He has given NO indication of ever leaving me alone and lonely again...but I can't trust myself. I trust him to a point, but I don't trust MYSELF. OOOF.

I have no memory of anything happening to me and I really cannot ask my parents about that. I have a difficult time with physical contact even from family members. My mother touches me a lot (my butt for example) and I tell her to stop and she doesnt stop and that created a fear in me because I felt harrased and I event dreamt about being abused by my mother so Idk if that dream is because of the recent actions or maybe because of something that happen in the past.

And yes, I follow the rules for a while and it's good. But then I repeat the same mistake over and over again. It's to the point where my mom thinks that I'm doing things that I'm not 'Like disrespecting her in front of my friends because I think it's cool' even though I don't do it. I've tried to talk to her, but she doesn't want to listen, because she already believes that I do these things. It's too the point where I've almost kill myself in front of her twice, and even though I wouldn't do that. The stress is so much, and she calls me names that I don't want to the point where I couldn't control all my emotions. And she drove in a mental hospital for me, and warned me about if I do it again I'll go, no buts. I want to let her know that I'm not someone that evil, but my old habits and mistakes keep coming and I couldn't handle it. There's other old habits that I still obtain and tried to change, like talking bad to people for jokes or etc. And it's hurting my friend's relationship, and even to the point where I'm doing it to my girlfriend. And I never mean it, but my mind always go to the worse words or habits ever. I feel like a failure, a mistake, a mistake my mom made after she said that 'I don't know who are you, you don't have my blood that's for sure', and I couldn't cry in front of her because it'll become worse. And I'm trying to keep my composure but sometimes my brain just goes to the worse possibly. I need some help, help of managing these problems. And if I could change."

TW: self-harm, sexual assault, suicidal thoughts andmention of eating disorders im 14, I've been struggling with mental issues or at least I think so since I remember. I can't get a diagnose or a therapist cause my parents are really unsupportive and if it came out to be anything more than like depression they'd probably call me crazy and disown me the moment I turn 18. I really have no other options nor anyone to help. Before ppl start answering that it's just hormones; I WISH. I've been self-harming for 3 years now, stuck in an eating disorder for 2+ years, tried to commit suicide 2 times now, don't think hormones could cause all that 100%. I have no idea what could've caused any of these, it's like they just appeared there at some point, the only BAD thing that's ever happened to me is getting SA'd by a mentally disabled classmate like a year ago but my problems started WAYYY before that so it could've only made it a little worse. Despite what I said about my parents at the beginning they're not THAT bad. My mom was rather present during my childhood, my father wasn't completely absent either, I'd call it an average trad family. I don't have any childhood trauma that I can remember, yeah I got spanked occasionally but so have most of my peers so I don't think it caused any long-term issues. I already wrote most of the things I struggle with but the biggest problem (I think) are my intrusive thoughts (or at least I think that's what they are). I have thoughts of unspeakable things multiple times on a daily basis. Including stuff I shouldn't name here. And the worst thing is that they aren't just there, I'm ashamed to admit but more than often I find myself drilling into them. I know it's disgusting but I just can't stop. I'm even more scared considering the fact that I have VERY little self-control and literally anything triggers me. I go from 0-100 in seconds and there's nothing I can do about it. Someone annoys me a tiny little bit? I'm gonna hate their guts till I forget why I even hate them and bang my head against a wall out of frustration that I can't hurt them in any way because I'm literally a bag of bones. Sometimes I think that this and consequences are the only things holding me back from acting out on others instead of myself. Another thing is that I noticed is that I don't feel empathy the same way others do and no I'm not trying to be edgy here. I know what's wrong and I know why but it's like I just KNOW it and don't FEEL it. If that can be any relevant, no I don't have any friends, no I don't have anyone I can talk to. I've been isolating myself for 2+ years and I'm unable to talk to people causally, usually I end up blocking them after 2 days just because. Before mods delete, I'm NOT asking for a diagnosis nor nothing of that sort, I'm looking for ways of help other than therapy that offer help for more than being shy or feeling down."

    "text": "My current mood Been having a rough time of it lately. Partner of 8 years broke up with me last week. Been feeling down and low...lower than I've ever been. All these thoughts running through my head. Missing her and my kids. Even miss the dog. Been thinking a lot lately about what happened in 2016. She had a miscarriage and I think about that every single day. How would they have turned out? Like me or her? Like their brother or sister? A mix of all or none at all? Wanted to to kill myself so much over these past 6 weeks. Tried too. Took an overdose last week and ended up in the hospital. Nearly threw myself off a bridge then in front of a train yesterday. Self harming a lot too. 3rd night in a row that ive cut myself pretty badly. It's all fucked up, it shouldn't be like this. Thoughts and feelings are paralysing me. I don't want to be here anymore I just want all this to end. Been drinking quite a bit too. Haven't done that since I was a teenager andi was a Borderline alcoholic. Professionals don't listen to me and just fob me off with sleeping tablets because \"sleep will help\". Dunno if I can't handle this anymore. I mourn the life my little bundle could of had. Been carrying that with me everyday. I mourn the death of my relationship especially now she doesn't want me in her life. I dunno what I'm doing anymore. I can't cope, can't go on like this. Can't sleep because theirs too much shit in my head going around and I can't grasp on to anything. Can't process or manage mmly emotions. I just want all this to stop. Don't want to feel it anymore, don't want to feel anything. Wish I had of thrown myself in front of that train. Angry that in alive right now. Feeling guilty and shameful. Feel angry towards myself for what I put her through. Can't talk to anyone about it coz they don't seem to understand. Feel isolated and alone, like I have to do this myself. Got no friends to talk to. It's getting harder each day and I'm struggling. Struggling with depression and anxiety and adhd. Possible autism and BPD too. Dunno how much longer.i can cope with all this."

    "text": "I am so slow As the title says, I am so slow. I am in university and have been working on an essay for my philosophy class which was due almost a month ago. I am very ashamed of this. This is no excuse, but I have been very depressed ever since the beginning of this semester (my second semester) and have not wanted to do anything besides go on TikTok (I have tried to discipline myself by setting a screen time limit to TikTok which fails as I always end up adding time to the limit) or sleep. This is odd because I actually did very well my first semester; I suspect this change is either due to the weather changing or because I went off of a medication (clomipramine) that I had been taking for a couple months as I started to think it was ineffective. Despite feeling like this I have aimed to work on the essay a couple hours each day, though sometimes I procrastinate and do not work on it. To be completely honest I do not want to work on it because I am so slow compared to others, and I feel like I have to waste so much more time working on it, just for it to be so bad compared to others. Today I timed how long it would take for me to rephrase a quote from the text I was discussing in the essay, it took me about 48 minutes, though I did get distracted at some points. For reference here is the quote and how I rephrased it: Quote: ‚Äú‚Ä¶we make an agent the more responsible the more motives we can find for his conduct.‚Äù How I rephrased it: The amount of motives that are found to contribute to someone‚Äôs decisions/actions justifies how responsible we find them for such decisions/actions. For example, when more motives are found behind someone's actions, we find that person more responsible for those actions. I am still in the process of getting my points together and rephrasing quotes, then I will need to create an outline, rough draft, and a final draft. It is so exhausting taking almost an hour to rephrase a quote and still be left unsatisfied by it. I hate to say it but I am so jealous of how others are able to make such amazing essays in such short amounts of time or how they can complete any schoolwork in such short amounts of time. It is so demotivating, saddening, and angering to take so long on this essay, and any schoolwork in general. I have decided to drop out of university but I am going to try my best to finish this semester passing all my classes. I am still unsure of what I want to do anyways - I do not really have anything I am interested in, or any career that I feel I would be able to succeed in. All this to say, I feel very hopeless about my future and I feel very ashamed of myself. This was just a vent really, I needed to get this out somewhere. Thanks if you stayed to read the whole thing, sorry if I blabbered too much."

    "text": "burntout but not quiet where I want to be So I (22f) may be burnt out. I have been home for 2 years and trying to appear for certain things that have unfortunately not worked out for me. I thought they would and they didn't. The reason for me to suspect that I am burnt out is because I am perpetually tired and I tried all supplements B-complex, Vit-D, calcium, iron, etc and I am still where I am. I have difficulty coming up with words and I am an avid reader and I good speaker despite that I have difficulty coming up with basic words. Then there's the retention problem and a lack of empathy towards myself and others. I sometimes catch myself thinking really insensitive thoughts and very often I have to correct my response but I don't correct that response when it comes to myself. The most contributing factor has to be a lack of curiosity, I was a cinephile, liked to read and learn about things and people and now I can't physically get myself to do any of that at all. I just want yes or no answers idc whether there are nuances to the thing and I have no interest in learning anything new. I am also aware that MBTI may not be the best, but it gives me a background. I am an INTJ, which eventually leads me to have very high expectations of myself. However, these two years have been filled with failure, which has created a sense of cynicism, which I can push away at times. I am at the stage where I have been tirelessly studying up to no yield and still nowhere and I am unhappy with the stage I am at. If any other situation, I would've taken a good break but I stopped right now I may be stuck here. I also can't get myself to do the things anymore. Also, I am very prone to psychosomatic diseases and they have been flaring up way too much and headaches even, it could be because of my Instagram too but I don't know. I am sleeping more than usual so I don't see why I should have headaches or feel tired. additionally, there was a sense of loneliness. I have been off Instagram when failure hit, initially, I thought ohhh I need to lock-in so gotta stay away but I think it maybe be because I am ashamed and last month I joined back and the feeling has intensified because people have moved forward. my question is really what do I do? how do I get out of this burnout? do I take a few days off? what do I do in those free days? should I keep going?"

    "text": "Anyone else want to escape? Everything in my life has been negative lately. Everyday I wake up with impending anxiety, stress, depression, and doom. But I wake up each day with the intention of being a good human, of being better than I was yesterday. But I‚Äôm getting the point to where I can‚Äôt keep going on. Nothing inside of me has strength anymore. I‚Äôm typically the happy, go bubbly, optimistic type of person, but lately no part of me has been that way. I‚Äôve never felt this unhappy and confused in my life. I can‚Äôt remember the last time I‚Äôve laughed or smiled. Before anyone says anything- Yes I‚Äôve been through a lot of crap- growing up with parents and a sibling with addiction problems, seeing multiple people die right in front of me, seeing my brother collapse and almost die infront of me from addiction while being told I was the reason why he‚Äôs alive and that I saved him, being cheated on, being bullied, having rumors made up about me, and so much more. But I‚Äôve never felt the emptiness I do now. I go back and fourth between being so depressed that I dissociate to the point to where I‚Äôm completely numb or to where my depression consumes me. Yes before anyone asks, I‚Äôve prayed, and I‚Äôve tried to help myself but I don‚Äôt have the energy to try anymore. I have a family that treats me like shit. And a partner who turns on me and causes issues when I allow myself to feel emotions. The sad thing is, is that although they occasionally turn on me, it‚Äôs the most support I‚Äôve ever received. I grew up in a family where mental health was stigmatized and I wasn‚Äôt allowed to talk about my feelings. I was also always both the punching bag growing up since I was the child who never got in trouble and the counselor of the family that was expected to resolve all of my family problems while also being there for adults while they were never there for me and would belittle me for having emotions or mental health issues. Still to this day, I feel like I can‚Äôt even have a panic attack around anyone else based on the horrible ways I‚Äôve been treated from having them infront of other people. I‚Äôve had people who are supposed to love me- mock my panic attacks, belittle & shame me, and yell at me for having them while simultaneously never comforting me. Anytime I‚Äôve ever needed someone they leave when I need them the most, no matter who it is. Even when I was the sickest I‚Äôve ever been in my life, my entire family abandoned me, and criticized me for being sick, just to get diagnosed with a lifelong disease that will impact me forever. I feel completely invisible. In the short 9 months I‚Äôve been engaged, I‚Äôve had one of my brothers try to cancel/ruin my wedding, threaten not to come, name call me over & over again, my dad has fallen back into addiction, my parents have tried to force me to invite my brother who has made my entire engagement hell, and my dad has threatened not to come to my wedding as well since I don‚Äôt want to invite my brother who has done everything possible & imaginable to try to cancel and ruin our wedding. How do I move forward? There‚Äôs so much more I want to say but it feels impossible to open up about it all. I‚Äôm so tired of being alone."

    "text": "Should We Bring Mental Health Institutions Back?/ Can Mental Health Institutions Solve the Crisis on Our Streets? I've been thinking a lot about the state of mental health care in Canada. When you walk through any downtown area (in Toronto in my case), you can‚Äôt help but notice the growing number of people on the streets, many struggling with homelessness, addiction, and severe mental health issues. Right now, the mental health system isn‚Äôt enough to handle these cases. Community mental health services, while well-intended, aren‚Äôt equipped to deal with people in crisis. These individuals often need immediate detoxification, stabilization, and psychiatric intervention before they can begin therapy or cognitive restructuring. Instead, people are left without proper care, creating a flood of individuals on the streets who are severely neglected. I recently watched a video about an individual named Rabbit, a man with so much potential who tragically passed away a few years after documenting his journey through addiction and mental health struggles in Toronto. He faced homelessness, drugs, lack of support, and connection. His story is heartbreaking because it shows how easily someone can slip through the cracks in our system. Rabbit‚Äôs death isn‚Äôt just a tragedy - it's an example of how our current mental health care systems fail people in crisis. I also recently wrote a paper on the Belleville crisis, and it‚Äôs clear to me that we're in the midst of a serious mental health and addiction emergency in Canada This is why I believe we need to bring back mental health institutions, but with a focus on recovery and rehabilitation. These institutions should be the first layer of care - providing stabilization and psychiatric support for people in acute crisis before transitioning them to community-based therapy. The goal should be recovery, not just managing symptoms or keeping people in institutions for extended periods. # How Could We Fund It Without Burdening Taxpayers? I get it - funding is the biggest issue. But I think we can find a way where taxpayers don‚Äôt bear the burden. Here‚Äôs how: * **Sin taxes** on substances like alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, and pharmaceutical companies. These industries make profits from addictions, so they should help fund the institutions that treat them. * **Gambling taxes** could also be a source of funding. * **Corporate responsibility programs** where large corporations contribute to mental health initiatives would help as well. This way, we can recycle money from industries that contribute to mental health crises, rather than relying on taxpayers to foot the bill. # Why This Matters * We need better care for people with severe mental health and addiction issues. A layered approach - starting with stabilization in a mental health institution and moving to community-based therapy‚Äîcould lead to better long-term outcomes. * Mental health institutions wouldn‚Äôt just help the individuals in crisis; they would also create more jobs in the mental health field. There‚Äôs a huge gap in the workforce, and many people with degrees in psychology are struggling to find work. This could help bridge that gap. * By reintegrating mental health care into institutional settings, we can give people a chance at recovery, rather than leaving them in a constant cycle of crisis. So, what do you think? Is this idea too idealistic, or could it actually work?"

For context, I'm (19m) a sophmore in college, and it's not been going well. I've come to the hard realization that I was probably not ready at the beginning for college, and life has been in the way since square one. With my parents going through a vertiable cold war divorce, me losing pretty much all my friends, long-term emotional abuse catching up with me, a failed relationship, and constant financial issues, it's been a mess of pretty epic proportions. I'm so exhausted all the time, I can barely get motivated to get out of bed, so I've been skipping classes, even though I'm on my last chance before I'm kicked out of college. I just dunno what to do, and every day my mind just looks for the next fastest exit. I've been taking risks, small stuff at first. Intentionally not looking when crossing the street, not bothering to be safe when doing daily tasks, or just neglecting or procrastinating seeking treatment for health issues. But it's been getting worse and worse, to the point I've basically got a death wish. I know it sounds really dumb, but my experiences in the past have left a bad taste in my mouth when it comes to therapy and support services, and I am thoroughly against admission to a hospital. So I'm not sure what to do except just wait and see. I know I wanna finish this year out, at least. Give it one final shot."

I (35F) asked him (42M) if he wanted to talk about it and he has shut down and is barely speaking to me. I reached out looking to talk about it, as i do well with healthy communication. His wife keeps assuring me he is just in a bad place from some personal stuff, but it all started around this time and I said some shit that maybe scared him off, and normally he shares his personal struggles with me. He is just shutting me out. (for context, we love each other platonically, or so i am lead to believe. We are best friends, it's not sexual or weird, we both have partners, its cool) Now, I have worked on this but I struggle with abandonment fear and rejection issues. This has caught me so off guard but it's sending me into an anxious tailspin. I'm having flooding thoughts of self harm/suicide, I am crying constantly, i am so fucking anxious that i could expire on the spot. I feel like I am experiencing some form of grief, mixed with a long winded panic attack.

She told me I need to tighten my belt and sacrifice other things (like what? Food? Rent?) so I can go to therapy. She (a fucking well-paid *doctor*) told me a story about how was told she needed to see the chiropractor every week for $45 a session, and while she felt that was too much, she just had to ‚Äòmove things around‚Äô to make it work. Last time I was in therapy it cost me $150 a week *with insurance*. The session I just had with her cost me $100, not to mention the cost of all my meds. It‚Äôs fucking insane how much all of this costs already. Am I supposed to find that amount under the couch cushions? And what is the insinuation here? Because I‚Äôm poor, I *deserve* to suffer from mental illness? You don't think I *want* to be in therapy? Absolutely unreal."

    "text": "I Survived a Genocide But I Feel Nothing I managed to evacuate from Gaza, leaving behind the rubble, the bodies, and the memories of the war zone. You‚Äôd think getting out would bring relief, a sense of safety‚Äîbut all it brought me was emptiness. I thought once I escaped, I‚Äôd be able to feel again, to grieve for the lives lost, for the people I knew. But I feel nothing. I‚Äôm in a place far from the violence now, surrounded by people who are living normal lives. They go about their day, complaining about trivial things‚Äîtraffic, their jobs, relationship problems. And I just stare at them. How do they not realize how absurd it all is? I survived hell, saw children torn apart in the streets, watched families disappear overnight, and now I‚Äôm expected to care about small talk? I don‚Äôt. Even after I got out, people wanted me to share my story, to talk about the horrors I escaped. But every time I do, I feel detached, like I‚Äôm telling someone else‚Äôs story. I describe the destruction, the bodies, the screams, but it feels like I‚Äôm reading from a script. I can‚Äôtonnect to it anymore. It‚Äôs like I left my emotions back there, buried under the rubble. I‚Äôve lost all sense of empathy. When I hear about someone dying, even someone close, it doesn‚Äôt register. I didn‚Äôt cry when I found out a friend of mine didn‚Äôt make it out. I didn‚Äôt care when I heard about others losing everything. I go through the motions, pretending to sympathize, but inside, it‚Äôs just blank. People think escaping the genocide means survival, but it‚Äôs not true. Part of me died there, and the part that made me human never made it out. Now, when I see images of what‚Äôs still happening, or hear about others‚Äô struggles, I can‚Äôt bring myself to feel anything. I walk past people begging for help, and I feel no urge to stop. I‚Äôm broken in ways no one can see. On the outside, I‚Äôm functioning. I smile, I work, I talk to people. But inside, I‚Äôm just as destroyed as the streets I left behind. It‚Äôs been 5 months"

They were fighting on the front porch while I was in the kitchen making a bottle for my 8 mo son who was sleeping in his crib on the other side of the house. After they were arguing, my dad walked in to the house, shut his bedroom door and shot himself in the head. I was right outside the door when it happened and I can‚Äôt get the sound out of my head. Luckily, my son slept through the whole thing and was quickly taken out of the house by his father while I called 911. My eyes hurt but I can‚Äôt sleep or close them with out everything replaying through my head. I feel like my life is in pieces and I don‚Äôt know what to do. That‚Äôs all I can really say... If you need help, please get it. Because of a horrible combination of alcohol, guns and depression, my son no longer has the grandpa that he so much adored and I am now with out a dad. EDIT: Thank you all so much for all the sentiments. I know it‚Äôs strange to post something so personal to random people but hearing from all of you makes me feel less alone, I guess. I 100% agree about therapy and I am definitely no stranger to it and the help it gives. Sadly, money is tight and my insurance is shit so if anyone has any resources to help me find a cheaper solution when it comes to therapy, I would be very grateful."

    "text": "I was inches from committing suicide 6 months ago, today I signed a lease for the nicest apartments in my city. Hang in there. Long story short, over the summer I was planning on driving my car over the edge of a cliff after I dropped some people off on vacation. I was overwhelmed in life and saw no way out aside from ending it all. Felt like a disappointment because I dropped out of college, worked as a personal trainer at a gym where I was taken advantage of and forced to work 16-17 hour days for pennies. Lived in some slummy apartments with no AC and barely had any grocery money. I usually bummed pizza from local Pizza shops at the end of the night when someone hadn‚Äôt picked up a carry out order. Sometimes I‚Äôd get something, sometimes I‚Äôd get told to fuck off. Got on average 3 hours of sleep aside from Saturday nights. Mental health was at an all time low. I made some changes that started with therapy. After that, I got a lucrative new sales job, love the people I work with, practice Muay Thai weekly, work out every day, and am in a much better place mentally. If you think this post is about me rooting my own horn... You‚Äôre right. I‚Äôm damn proud of the progress I‚Äôve made. Whatever it is you‚Äôre going through, keep fighting. Keep waking up every day. Keep on keeping on."

It portrays suicide as something ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù and ‚Äúmeaningful‚Äù and not what it really is. And the whole ‚Äúblame it on other people even though they tried to help me‚Äù thing? Nope nope nope, that‚Äôs so toxic. Idk if I just feel that way because of my PTSD (an older guy blamed me for his suicide attempt because I didn‚Äôt ‚Äúhelp him enough‚Äù even though I did everything I could and was only 13), but it‚Äôs just not really how suicide should be portrayed, in my opinion. Also, the way they show flashbacks of Hannah Baker from when she was alive makes it seem like she‚Äôs still alive in some way. They reeeeally push this harmful ‚Äúsuicide is something you choose as a weapon to hurt other people‚Äù agenda, when in reality, suicide is often the exact opposite. Idk, personally I really don‚Äôt like that show, and i think it‚Äôs harmful. I once opened up about my suicidal thoughts and depression to a friend, and she was all like ‚Äúwho made you feel that way?‚Äù like it was other people‚Äôs fault.

One night in particular though, my boyfriend helped catalyze me getting better. It was insanely difficult to get out of bed. Sure I‚Äôd get up maybe for an occasional snack or a quick bathroom break but I was just stuck mentally and physically, and in this case I hadn‚Äôt left my mattress for days. I wasn‚Äôt okay at all. Then one day out of the blue, my boyfriend went into my closet and grabbed me one of his t- shirts, (my) underwear, and (my) shorts. He propped me up and undressed, then dressed me while my eyes swelled up. He didn‚Äôt even ask. He just did it. Every time I think about that moment I tear up because it was the most intimate and sweetest thing anyone has ever done for me. I really am so lucky to have such a caring man in my life.

    "text": "Just had my cousin's memorial on Zoom, and it was atrocious. My cousin recently killed herself. We were close when we were growing up. Her parents were extremely strict and had very high expectations of her, expectations she obviously felt she couldn't meet. I'm pissed off because in her memorial, not once did they mention it was a suicide. The closest thing I could find to an acknowledgement of that fact was in an obituary posted elsewhere online, where they said she \"succumbed to the pressures of COVID-19\" which is the most bullshit way to sugar-coat a suicide they could've come up with. As someone who has been very very close to taking my own life, having been hospitalized for that very reason just last year, it bothered me to my core that they pretended like it didn't happen. Just sang songs about god, beating around the bush and making it clear that she would be going to \"heaven\" and not \"hell\" even though everyone knows she did the big bad and committed \"sin\". No recognition at all for the pain she had obviously been dealing with silently for her entire life. I posted on her memorial site, just a quick blurb of some memories I had with her, a nice photo of us when we were young, and I quick sentence at the end basically saying \"Some of us face our struggles silently, and you never know who could be fighting an invisible battle, so always be there to lend a shoulder to someone, whether they ask for it or not.\" And I linked NAMI and the suicide hotline. They fucking deleted my post and asked me to take all references to suicide or struggles out. They reached out to my parents too to try and reign me in. I'm honestly appalled. They seem embarrassed and ashamed of her, and they want to hide what she did because it makes them look bad in the \"eyes of God\". Fuck man. Wouldn't even let a supportive message and a link to NAMI slip in there. Had to be clean and without any reference to mental health whatsoever. I feel so bad for her. If her parents made \\*me\\* feel this invalidated in one fell swoop, I can't imagine what her life was like with them. Just needed to vent, thanks for reading."

    "text": "I did acid when I was 17 and have been feeling dead inside since then When I was 17 I decided to take acid with my friends and I ended up going through a traumatic bad trip that some may call \"ego death\", my subjective self was basically fading away and I felt like I was dying and literally entering vegetative state as I just couldn't remember how to speak who I was nor what my purpose was. When the trip was over I was fine but still in shock. Then after a few weeks I started having ptsd and anxiety attacks that made my life hell. Now fast forward a few years and I just feel depersonalized all the time, like I'm not there. Of course I can ground myself, but sometimes I just get disconnected from reality, go through derealizations and feel like I'm just a little man watching my life through the lense of my eyes. Have anyone gone through similar things ? Please help me Also if you're contemplating doing psychedelics and you're below 25, please don't, what people say is true, don't gamble losing yourself for 3 hours of pleasure"

I guess I have mental health issues but im not in therapy at the moment, the current situation put that a bit on the back burner. But in the past I hated myself and attempted to end my life on a handfull of occasions, getting always closer to breaking and doing it. Maybe three month ago I was approched by a social worker and he helped me find my way to a home for young men in rough situations in just a couple of weeks. It is still hard to belive how easy that was. For about a month and a half I just kinda houng out and got acclimated but kept some of my old habbits up (not drugs, just kinda being aimless). With Corona crashing the party, I spend all of my time at home and lazed around. But this week I started to work in the extensive garden. Planting crops, installing watering systems and stuff. Today I planted 100+ onions, waterd some salat and cleaned up a volleyball field. I felt good doing that. Then I had myself a nice cold shower and sat down to write this. Im happy right now. Im happy that I enjoyed work. I put the fear that all this shit in my life was because Im just lazy behind me. I enjoy working. Im crying."

Today I'm sitting in my new apartment. I moved in a week ago. My beautiful son (who admittedly is the result of a manic episode but I have no regrets) is sleeping in the room next door. My bills are paid and I have no worries about keeping them paid. I never thought I would be stable enough to live on my own. For the past 10 years it's just been hospitalization after hospitalization. 13 hospital visits and 7 attempts later I thought there was no hope for me. But I did it. I love my job. I love my friends. I love my son. I love my life. And I'm going to keep fighting as hard as I can to maintain this. Not just for my son but for me, because I deserve to be happy. I deserve to feel safe. It took me a very long time to realize that but I know it's true now."

You may think i‚Äôm making this up but i‚Äôm not i swear. Tonight I held a knife to myself, and my cat ran to my side. At first I thought he was just trying to cuddle or get me to pet him, but I then noticed instead of rubbing into my hand, he was pushing the knife away. I broke down into tears and he immediately climbed into my lap. I moved and he laid beside me, and now refuses to let me out of his sight. His little paw is sitting on my arm, and when i move he moves. This is insane, but he stopped it, if it wasn‚Äôt for my cat i‚Äôd be dead. I can‚Äôt thank him enough, he‚Äôs my angel baby. I love him so much. Update: I‚Äôm better, I decided to stay for him. Mentally I‚Äôm not okay, but I‚Äôm working on myself and I will get better soon. Thank you all for the love and support!

I have new school opportunities, a new relationship, new friends. My life has truly turned around. I got out of my toxic relationship, healed, found to love myself again, and now I‚Äôm loved by the most amazing guy. Thank you all, you helped me all through a very hard time!

    "text": "Does anyone else get angry about how much effort you have to put in to stay stable? I woke up exhausted, feeling like sand was holding me down. But I knew the sand wasn‚Äôt real. I was capable of being a function human, so I decided to be one. I got out of bed, showered and brushed my teeth, I put on clothes and left the house briefly to shop. And then I binge ate crap food, drank vodka, watched 10 hours of tv whilst taking lots of pain meds for back trouble. I‚Äôm not really sure what I‚Äôm trying to say. I guess I want people to know that I tried. I fought back at my body and forced myself up, forced myself to do the bare minimum of existing and damnit - I was so proud. I want the satisfaction of ‚Äòdoing the healthy thing‚Äô even though it was hard, and then I want the reward to be a sudden ability to live easily. But it didn‚Äôt come. I gave in to the dull ache of sadness and consumed sugar, salt and digital crap until I felt sick. I‚Äôm back in bed now thinking about every mistake I made today and how I wish I was stronger. I know that a path back to a healthy mental space/ lifestyle is going to be a long, hard road after neglecting it for so long. And I know I have to do it, and do it now before it deteriorates further. I just wish it wasn‚Äôt so intensely challenging. I wish that I didn‚Äôt have to eat healthily, exercise, keep a tidy house, be social JUST TO STAY AFLOAT. Missing a run means missing on the happy endorphins I rely on to keep me going through the day. Having an unhealthy meal makes me sluggish, that in turn makes me feel that tiny bit worse which is enough to make me not do chores. I hate being in such a fragile state where i‚Äôm not quite mega-depressed, just always on the verge of not leaving my bed for 48 hours. TL:DR Life is hard, I like easy things. Nothing worthwhile comes easily."

A random user reached out to me and started helping out, by giving me advice and opened up to me about her own problems. She gave me a place to vent and someone to reach out to. Now I haven't been bulimic for the last 2 years (20 now), I did it solely from education and will which I'm proud of, because proper therapy is not accessible here. I started exercising, and educated myself alot about nutrition and physical health, I sometimes relapse, but very rarely (once a day every couple of months or so). And she definetly helped me alot. And I want to thank her, and talk to her. Oh Boi do I have alot of stories to tell her about (unfortunately not all are good).

The last time i self harmed was 2 years ago and it was so deep it still hasnt fully healed to this day. I feel ashamed of them and hate when people ask me about how i got my scars or when they look at them.

I've been struggling with this feeling of being completely inadequate compared to people in the same age group. Everyone around me seems to have goals and passions. Not that I don't (I do), but I feel so far from achieving them or that I'll never achieve them. I'm graduating college in December and I'm absolutely terrified of being out of school. I look around at my peers and they seem so much more... professionally mature than me? It's a weird feeling and its hard to explain. Everyone around me seems to always be doing *something* to benefit them and then there's me. I procrastinate; I have major anxiety; I want to just sleep every day and I am so down in the dumps. I don't know what to do and I'd love to meet people who feel the same way as me. Ive been struggling with this feeling since I started college and I don't know what to do. EDIT: wow, thank you all for your kind words!! Im sorry i cant get around to replying to all of them. Your words really do make me feel better knowing im not the only one. Thank you for the 500+ upvotes and award! I had never gotten an award before!! Love you all ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"

    "text": "Adopted a cat during quarantine and it is unbelievable how our bond together has helped ease the pains of isolation. So long story short, a couple months ago I was losing my mind feeling trapped inside my apartment with very little to do. Like many of you, probably. It was just me and my roommate going about our usual routine, and life just seemed so... bleak. Then my friend asked if I could babysit his kitten and it was a game changer. I found out cuddling, nuzzling, feeding and caring for a cat was so rewarding and realized how special the bond between cats and humans are. So I adopted my own kitten a few weeks later, and we fell instantly in love with each other. I have so much time to appreciate the little moments between us, to watch him grow, and to witness our bond grow stronger everyday because we spend so much time together. Not only that, but I feel more confident in reaching out to my friends and family on social media/phone again because I don‚Äôt feel alone anymore. I would say if you are feeling alone or you are looking for a sense of purpose during this time, I highly recommend getting a pet, because this is a rare occasion where your bond with your pet will be stronger than ever. If you want to follow my cat on IG, I post almost every day and you can watch him grow too. @finn_the_feline_._._ TLDR; Adopted a cat during quarantine, and our bond continues to grow rapidly day by day. Very rewarding experience and eases the pains of quarantine."

TL;DR please seek help if you are struggling, if you‚Äôre unhappy, or even if you‚Äôre happy and want to stay that way. There is a light. 3 years ago, my family home was foreclosed on. 2 years ago my mom had a stroke and was paralyzed and left unable to speak. 3 months ago she passed away after a long battle. I haven‚Äôt been able to speak to my best friend for 2 years and now I‚Äôll never be able to. Within that time, I had two suicide attempts. I was on pills. I was drinking alone everyday. I was hospitalized. I was uninsured. I was homeless. I thought I was beyond repair. For two years now since then, I‚Äôve been in therapy. Every week for two years. Now, I‚Äôm engaged. An awesome step son. I have a good job. A nice place to live. I‚Äôm excited for the future. Therapy saved me. But not my therapist. My therapist is amazing. He‚Äôs smart. Insightful. Knows when to listen. But when I started therapy, I thought my therapist would just tell me what to do. I‚Äôd do it. And I‚Äôd be fixed. That‚Äôs not how it worked for me. A lot of my friends who aren‚Äôt in therapy have been afraid to, or too stubborn to go seek help. They think they know better than a professional. BUT HERES THE RUB: My therapist didn‚Äôt know how to fix me. I did. (For me personally) therapy has been about bringing out repressed thoughts and feelings. Things I couldn‚Äôt talk to my friends about. Couldn‚Äôt talk about with my family. Therapy also made me take accountability. For all my mistakes, the people I‚Äôve wronged. I can now accept my past and look to the future. A future I wanted to take away from myself. I hope if even one person reads this and feels inclined to help themselves. Because you can. P.S. I‚Äôm new to Reddit. And I like it a lot. I‚Äôve already made friends. If you need a friend, I‚Äôm here!"

They are just trained to listen and answer with \"I'm sorry you are going through that\" and \"Do you think there's anything you could do to lessen those thoughts\"? and \"It must be so hard for you\" and \"Do you have a plan?\". It's literally the same phrases every time. It's like they are a bunch of robots. So goddamn repetitive and predictable.

I go to counseling on my own. They don't even want to do the research on Anxiety Disorders. The thing is I was diagnosed with one anxiety disorder a decade ago, so this isn't NEW. &#x200B; I feel a bit jealous, WHICH IS INSANE, of my grandfather because he is going through what we suspect is Alzheimer and my grandma and mom said if he is diagnosed with it they would research the crap out of it and find ways to help him. I'm really happy for him that they won't treat him like it's his fault. &#x200B; I'm honestly at my wits end and I have been creating space for a while but family visits, I live with my grandparents, so I cannot truly avoid them without being an ass. I just CANNOT wait for December. Please please come quickly. I'm begging you, I can't take it anymore."

    "text": "My psychologist told me to kill myself So I was at my weekly appointment with my psychologist & she made my mom go in with me even though I'm 19 & it wasn't a family session. After a few minutes I said I was uncomfortable & she got mad saying I disrespected my mother by saying that & that it gets her angry because her mom had died. As I was walking out of her office I said \"I swear to God I'm gonna kill myself\" & she said \"Okay, kill yourself\". I turned around & said \"what?\" & she said \"Go ahead, kill yourself, go on\" & I stormed out, had a panic attack & called my sister. We went back to her office & she didn't want to speak to us & instead sent her secretary to talk to us. He told us to follow him outside, took us to the parking lot, yelled at us, squared up & called us sick. He said that since we are \"sick\" we should be careful. I told him that the doctor couldn't say those things to me & he said \"Who's the doctor? She is, so she can say it & you said it first.\" Then he cussed at us & told us to leave. I have the audio recording of the secretary yelling at us & stuff. My parents are really mad & wanna report her. TLDR : My psychologist told me to kill myself & I wanna know if she is allowed to say that to me. :/ Update: I just found out her secretary is her husband. üòï"

When Im in that 65% i feel like ive gained control of my mental health. I am in control. I am happy and functional not by random chance of my brain allowing me to be, but bc I worked for it.

    "text": "As a rape survivor, I want to let you know that things will get better! Maybe not now, maybe not immediately but they eventually will! Don‚Äôt give up! Although I myself still struggle after being raped nearly 2 and a half years ago (and the rape will impact me my whole life) I want to let you know that time really heals wounds. After, I got raped it was the worst time in my life. There are no words to describe how horrible it was. From a person who was very confident, lived in multiple countries, travelled the world I was afraid to go to my local grocery shop. I nearly had a panic attack when I was alone with a man in a shopping aisle. I had to postpone all my exams, my academic and social life suffered immensely. I had PTSD, anxiety, depression etc. I had very dark thoughts. I considered taking a year out of university because just getting out of bed was a struggle for me. I could write a book about all the negative effects of rape. But now I honestly feel so much better. Of course, I still suffer the effects. But compared to the past I have made great progress. I am planning to continue my therapy though as I feel like my healing process is not over. But I want to let you know that things will get better. I have graduated from top 30 university in the world with a prestigious degree, last year I was a committee member of multiple societies at my university. I am looking forward to life. One thing I would tell you is that don‚Äôt put a timeline or deadline for your recovery. And don't compare yourself to others. I used to wonder will I ever get better. Why I am not getting better already? Why is it taking so long? Don‚Äôt compare your recovery to someone else. Although I will recover the whole of my life, what I mean is that If you are not getting better/progressing in a certain period of time is okay. Everyone is different and take as much time you need to heal. For me, it was also hard to see all my friends enjoying life and this tragedy happening to me. But now I am slowly accepting that life didn‚Äôt turn out exactly the way I wanted. And bad things happened to good people. I am posting this because I felt much better myself reading stories of rape victims that persevered and ‚Äòovercame‚Äô their trauma. I am wishing you nothing but the best. And please don‚Äôt give up. Life is beautiful, even if it does not see this way now."

They often take general things that could apply to almost anyone and try to claim they're a result of mental illness. They'll title a video something like \"10 signs you might have bipolar\" and then list things like \"You like to hang out with friends sometimes, but others you prefer to spend time to yourself\", or \"Its hard for you to stay focused on just one hobby\". Plus, they have a bad habit of labelling EVERYTHING as a \"trauma response\". You're a picky eater? Trauma. You get nervous around crowds? Trauma. Theyll even say that PRETENDING to have trauma is a sign of trauma. It seriously pisses me off, because what they're doing is causing great harm to those who actually struggle with mental health. It delegitimizes the experiences of those with mental illness, and it makes a lot of people assume that mental illness' aren't actually too big a struggle to have."

    "text": "I Am Thoroughly Disgusted By The Portrayal of Mental Health in 13 Reasons Why Season 4, And Disturbed By the Amount of People Defending It. 13 Reasons Why has always been controversial from the start. I understand where people come from when they say the first season glorified suicide. Personally, I believe the first season had good intentions, and truly was trying to raise awareness for suicide. Of course, they completely sabotaged Hannah Baker‚Äôs character in S2, which had a detrimental effect on the message. But Season 4 - oh, it makes my blood boil. Clay‚Äôs undiagnosed, undefined ‚Äúmental illness‚Äù - at best described by the show as ‚Äútrauma‚Äù - is used as an excuse for outrageously bad behavior. By bad behavior, I mean locking his friends in a cabin in the woods and clanging an axe against the door. I mean vandalizing his school and burning his principal‚Äôs car. I mean waving a gun around in front of the entire student body. And worst of all, when he finds out his adoptive brother is dying, his immediate response is to run to the police station and yell, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got a gun!‚Äù Why? Because he needed people ‚Äúto see how broken he was.‚Äù This one really hit me close to home. When I was 6, my infant sister had to spend all 4.5 months of her life on a ventilator in the hospital. When she died - near Christmas time - I did not go terrorize people so that they could see ‚Äúhow broken I was.‚Äù Yet [few people]( see it that way. When I say this, 13 RW fans tell me ‚ÄúWell, you were 6. Your emotions were not as deep as our beloved FICTIONAL character Clay.‚Äù I hate what that show became, and the perverse effect it has. EDIT Thank you for all of the heartfelt responses and experiences you have shared. I truly had started to believe I was in the minority with my critique of 13 Reasons Why. I‚Äôm glad to know there are others who share the same concerns."

Ever since I could remember I would hear them having sex at night while they thought I was sleeping. We went through a lot of houses in the time this happened. I'm currently 17 and the first time I recall hearing her doing this was when we lived with my aunt shortly after my parents broke up and I shared a room with my mom. She would almost every night have sex and I would have to sit there for what felt like hours covering my ears. Then we eventually started living in a camper and it would happen so much the whole camper would shake and all I would hear was the noises. Now we live in a house, and at least we have our own rooms but I still hear them because the walls are so thin and they leave the door open. I bring this up because I cannot and never have been able to have a healthy sexual relationship with myself without thinking of them having sex. The noises and the shaking. I just wanted to tell this on here because this is the only way I feel like I can anonymously say it and I just want some help because it still happens to this day and I just wonder if it's trauma or if I'm just being overly dramatic. EDIT: I would also like to add I know it is my mom's right to have sex. I know it's natural, but I just don't like hearing it EDIT 2: Thank you all for the kind words.

I normally live at home with my family but I've had to move out for their safety. I haven't seen any family or friends in 2 months now. I rang in my 24th today in a room with a baby suspected for COVID-19 who was very sick. I was holding the baby while the doctor was doing a lumbar puncture. Wearing the same mask I've been wearing all day and full gown, face shields, gloves. I could feel my phone vibrating with messages from friends/family. I'm not even an emotional person but I just started crying silently. Everyone was so concentrated that no one noticed. I went to the back after and spent 20 mins having a good cry while listening to the stable song from BOTW (LOL). I wasn't sad about working on my birthday, having to wear sweaty PPE all day or even having to deal with a sick baby (I deal with them all the time). I think I was just so overwhelmed the last few weeks and this was the first time I let my emotions out. Thanks for reading this. Hope everyone is staying safe. EDIT: WOW.

Until yesterday after learning that my finals for my last semester in college got cancelled and I wanted to celebrate with my friends. An hour into celebration, suddenly I felt paranoid and anxious that people around me didn't want to be around me and were signaling me to leave. I love my friends and they are supportive of my situation and I also knew what I felt wasn't true. Regardless of that I had to leave, lay in my bed for awhile and then go to sleep. I hate the fact that my mental health stood in the way of celebrating the end of my undergraduate career. I wish I could've been normal and not have to feel the way I feel. Being mentally stable is such a huge privilege people don't realize. Well sorry about the rant but I needed to get it out.

He would then sit on one of the chairs and watch me cook and eat breakfast, and when I was getting all ready to leave, he would wait for me to walk over and pet him goodbye for the day. When I got home, he‚Äôd be waiting for me. He‚Äôd lead me back upstairs and stand in the spot my bag‚Äôs supposed to go. Then we‚Äôd play fetch with toy balls and I‚Äôd give him lots of pets until we tired out. Then I would get on the computer for work and games, and he‚Äôd hop into his cat bed nearby and fall asleep. When it was time for bed, he sometimes even got up to lead me to the bathroom and make sure I was brushing my teeth, then go back to bed. Since the pandemic started, I‚Äôve had nowhere to go. Nothing to do. And even several months later, I can tell he misses the routine. He still tries to wake me up on time. He‚Äôs been trying different tactics. The most effective one so far seems to be bringing a toy and doing cuddle rolls just out of reach of the bed so I have to get up to pet him. He still meows if I‚Äôm in the shower for more than ten minutes. When I do finally go downstairs, he rushes ahead of me halfway down and leads me the rest of the way. He frequently makes circles around my feet as I‚Äôm on the computer, asking for pets and playtime. It breaks me heart when he does these things. I know he‚Äôs trying so hard. Literally the most caring individual when it comes to me taking care of myself is my cat. But lot of his effort goes in vain, and it wracks me with guilt and appreciation every morning to watch him try."

    "text": "Some random guy saved my life today and he didn‚Äôt even realize it So I hit rock bottom months ago, but I brought a shovel with me and I‚Äôve been getting worse and worse. I wrote my suicide note this morning and my plan was to take my pistol and end it all tonight when I got home from work. I had everything planned and I was set. Then this evening I was at work delivering pizzas. I went to this one house and I wasn‚Äôt sure if I was at the right address or not but there was a man in the driveway and I asked him if I was at the right address. He said he wasn‚Äôt sure because it was his bosses house, not his, and he was only there to pick up his car. Then we started talking and he mentioned how I was smiling. He spoke about how he was 63 years old, he was a military veteran, and how with people my age he doesn‚Äôt see people smile like I did. It was a fake smile I put on so when I greet customers it‚Äôs a good experience. But he picked up on my smile, we chatted and he was making me laugh, he ended up giving me a big hug and was telling me how I should appreciate my friends, my family, and life. This guy had no clue I was depressed and suicidal and was planning on taking my life 3 hours later, yet he still told me all of this. He ended up giving me some cheese he had (I didn‚Äôt eat it) but the reason why he gave it to me is because the packaging had a huge smile on it and he told me to have it and to keep on smiling and spreading positivity. This guy was only at the house to pick up his car, he was only there for 5 minutes, yet in that 5 minutes is when I showed up. If that delivery was 5 minutes earlier or 5 minutes later I would have already taken my life, but the timing was perfect, and I‚Äôm still here. I‚Äôm not a super religious person, but I truly believe this man was my saving grace, he was sent by god to let me know it‚Äôs not my time to go. I gotta keep fighting. I got his bosses phone number from the side of the work truck that was sitting in the driveway and I plan on calling him tomorrow and letting him know this story and asking him to thank his employee for me. God is real and he sent this man to save my life"

    "text": "Just because some people don't make a scene of their mental disorders, doesn't mean they aren't struggling Just because some people don't look or act mentally ill, that doesn't mean they don't have a problem going on. If they are trying hard to hide it, it's possible they're struggling more since they have to hold it in. Also, if someones symptoms don't seem as severe as your own, that doesn't mean they don't have a problem and therefore aren't entitled to get help. Kids shouldn't need to come out about being depressed by attempting suicide because they have no other way to prove it's a real problem that they deal with. And they definitely shouldn't have to go as far as to commit suicide to show they've struggled. &#x200B; I want people to get help without being told their OCD is for attention, and that their depression is just an excuse to be lazy, their anxiety is just an excuse to avoid doing things, or their ADHD is just an excuse to misbehave. If people are so worried over others faking this stuff for pity, then maybe don't give them pity and that's the problem solved then? Instead of giving them the things you think they're faking problems to get, try to push them to see professional help and leave it at that instead of going out of your way to make it worse for them. &#x200B; Nobody should be allowed to do terrible things and get away with it by blaming their disorder, I get that. If someone you know is doing that, treat it like the law does: don't punish or hate them, but maybe send them to a psych ward to get help if they truthfully are harming others because they can't control themselves. &#x200B; If anyone out there is afraid to come out about a struggle of theirs because they're afraid of being called an attention seeker, don't hold back because of people like this. Know that bottling it up will make it worse over time. Tell someone that will understand (maybe a school psychologist or a doctor) before it becomes too severe to fix easily. Once you do that, it will be so much easier."

It's common for a lot of people suffering with depression to feel that life is pointless and a waste of time. When I think about it, the only logical purpose to our existence is to procreate; which arguably could be seen as pointless, as it's ultimately unfulfillable. This train of thought always leads me to the same answer; which is that my depression isn't caused by some sort of chemical imbalance, or poor circumstances, but the understanding that my life is in fact pointless. Is this shared, and if so, how do you overcome (or bypass) these thoughts to allow a productive life?"

For years I wanted to die and I begged my mother for permission to die to end my suffering. I literally got my brain zapped 14 times to fight it (ECT is actually very safe and effective for severe treatment resistant depression). But all those labels don't matter. So let me tell you a few things: 1. Your suffering is as equally valid as mine. 2. Everything is relative. You can have an amazing life and still be suffering. 3. Your suffering does not need justification. You feel what you feel. Screw invalidating statements like \"It's just hormones\". 4. We all have our own journey don't compare your life/struggles to those of others. 5. You deserve growth as a human being even if you don't feel like you do. Our illnesses cloud our perspective of the past, present, and future. 6. Don't believe everything you think. 7. There is no \"cure\". Suffering is part of human existence and by learning to accept it and sit with it we can overcome it. p.s Now I have more happy days than depressed days.

    "text": "Would someone take the time to wish me a happy birthday? I don't have anyone and don't want to feel so alone today. Today is my birthday and this sounds pretty sad, but I just want someone to wish me a happy birthday and maybe say something nice. I no longer have any friends or family left and just want some sort of human connection, even if it is just over Reddit, to make me feel just a bit less isolated and forgotten. I have just endured so much lately and I don't have anyone to talk to or confide in, but I thought I could make it through today just fine. I was wrong. I feel stupid and pitiful while I'm typing this, but I just want to know someone is out there and understands.Getting to this point happened without me even realizing how solitary I had become until I was completely alone. I might as well lay it out, as just the act of typing it might be some sort of catharsis. So how did I end up here? I started typing out damn near my whole life story, but that made this post so long that if I left it included there was an even smaller chance someone would read this. So highlights then? Abandoned by parents, raised by grandparents, abused by neighbor from ages 5 to 8, horrible abandonment issues, started getting into drugs, dropped out of high school, got a GED, some life happened, was totally Goth, some more life happened, made some music and art, now only Goth on the inside, started college, got married, wife left and grandparents arrested/institutionalized due to Alzheimer's/dementia in the same weekend, abruptly left college to move home to sort everything out, oh hey drugs, slowly watched my only family deteriorate before my eyes until they didn't even recognize me any longer, raging heroin addiction to try not to feel any of this, grandfather died, got in trouble with the law, lost everything I owned, homeless junkie interlude, lost almost 3 years of my life in jail/prison over less than $4,000 worth of bad checks, oops can't get a decent job due to criminal record, congestive heart failure, almost die, start getting my life back together, meet a nice girl, marry nice girl, grandmother dies, oh hey again drugs, finally got off the drugs, surprise wife departure, heart failure keeps getting worse, can barely walk, can't work anymore, no job, no insurance, no access to healthcare. That about sums it up the backstory. I finally have gotten some healthcare and counseling. Sadly, I can no longer work. I'm trying to go through the disability process, but that takes a great deal of time. It is difficult without proper access to the doctors I need, but I'm getting there. I've also been clean for 4 years and I'm never going back to that dependence. Never before in my life did I ever feel like I was completely done with drugs, but this time it has really stuck. Haven't even had any cravings and now it never even crosses my mind. I'm finally in a good and stable place in my recovery. Now I have other issues though. Poverty is very real. The threat of eviction looms nearly every month. Being able to afford the 12 different prescriptions I take is really hard and I find myself cutting pills in half because even $70 a month for medicine is a real challenge. I was able to get enrolled back in college and that is the plan of how to survive until I graduate and find work I'm physically able to handle. I'm working towards a career in counseling because I want to be able to use all of these nightmare experiences to help other people. I want to use what time I have left on this planet to help others and hopefully leave it better than I found it. That is how you end up alone on your 40th birthday, typing on an ancient laptop that you pray survives a couple more months until you transfer schools and can get a replacement with financial aid funds. My family died. Drugs pushed everyone away for years except other drug addicts and an addict isn't anyone's friend. I am no longer able to work, so I don't have those human connections anymore. My wife had been my best friend, so when she surprised me by suddenly leaving the last person I had a connection with went with her. Now that my congestive heart failure has progressed just walking enough to shop for groceries, take out the trash, or getting the mail is a huge challenge, so just going out to walk around and meet people is near impossible. Having zero available disposable income also doesn't help. If I can hold on a couple more months and everything works out I'll be able to switch schools and have more aid options that will take care of my financial and healthcare needs. I'm just trying to hold on and it is so hard. There is the abbreviated story if you somehow stopped on this post and actually read through everything. If you made it this far, thank you for listening. If you have the time to say happy birthday or say something nice I would really appreciate it. You really don't know how much it would mean to me. No one else is going to tell me today, so you might get to be the only person that wishes me a happy birthday. I don't get any presents or any cake. I don't get a birthday meal or get to do anything cool. I don't get to go anywhere or see anyone. There won't be any birthday cards in the mail or celebratory emails. That's okay though. If one person manages to take the time to read this and let me know there is someone, anyone out there then it'll be alright. &#x200B; Edit: Update - Thanks so much to everyone. I barely have any words. Just thank you all so very much. You did bring a grown man to tears, but the best kind. I haven't had anyone say anything this nice to me in years and just reading through these comments is the single best thing I've experienced in a long time. &#x200B; Update 2. I am speechless. I've read every comment. Tried to respond to every chat, but I have to get back to bed for now. I just wanted to thank everyone again. All of you helped turn my birthday into an amazing and memorable experience. From the very bottom of my humbled heart, thank you."

He was riding with one of his other friends and he was high while he was driving. My friend was in the back of the truck when it happened. This wasn‚Äôt a collision with another car he hit a guard rail and my friend went flying out of the back of the car. He died on impact, but the paramedics were able to resuscitate him. The guy driving ran away in the woods nearby. My friend died 3 times before they finally pulled the plug. I hate to imagine the pain he was in. Everyone around me keeps mentioning him and I can‚Äôt handle it. We grew up together and now he‚Äôs gone. I went to a pawnshop nearby my school while i was waiting for my brother and i met the dad of one of my friends who was also really close to my friend who died. We talked for about 90 minutes before I left. The only good part about today is that I know I‚Äôm not the only person who cared about him."

If you push yourself past your best abilities you will do worse. Doing your best means knowing your limits and working within them. It‚Äôs not the literal thing I read but something along those lines and I actually had an ‚ÄúOH‚Äù moment that I have extremely rarely. I never realized that I misheard doing my best as I should push myself to be *the* best. But how good you are at something is on a bell curve and if you strive past ‚Äúyour best‚Äù you will become worse. It actually kinda helps a little with not feeling guilty about taking breaks but anyway I thought someone else might need to hear this too."

Suffering from mental illness is one of the most draining things, everyone knows about the overt effects of anxiety, depression etc... but the damage this can have on your energy levels seems to get overlooked. When your brain is attacking itself 24/7 it never has a chance to rest, this doesn‚Äôt even just manifest itself in being mentally tired but being physically tired. My muscles ache, I move slowly and am constantly fighting the urge to just lie down. Due to Covid I‚Äôve been forced to move back into with my parents, now things are opening up again they‚Äôve had some of their friends over for dinner and find myself being outlasted by them constantly. A bunch of people in their mid 60s have more energy than a 23 year old, it‚Äôs embarrassing and pathetic. I just hate that having to deal with mental illness every waking minute wasn‚Äôt enough but now I‚Äôve also got to have the stamina levels of someone in their 80s. It‚Äôs not fair :(."

One of the things I regularly see people doing when trying to help those with mental health problems is to call out how they're thinkin negatively or irrationally or whatever they're doing wrong. This is only half of the step. As someone who suffers from mental health problems this doesn't help. It just feels like a dig. When you point this out, I already know. I know I'm being irrational, I know I'm being negative, but I don't know how to be rational or positive. I need help. I need you to tell me what the rational or positive thought is, I need to be made aware of the exact actions I could take or thoughts I could have to help me stop feeling this way and I guarantee other people do to. When we're criticised on the way we're thinking and not given any advice it can be a trigger. When we're criticised on the way we're thinking but given advice to overcome this it is actually helpful."

It's is truly amazing the wonders just cutting out such a thing to rely on out of your life can do for a person. Feeling like I have some form of control on my life again is something I never saw myself being able to achieve.. To anyone else with this feeling, you can get there.

I'm currently sitting behind my desk at work - my boss isn't in and I have my own office so I'm completely alone, with no one to bother me. I get paid well for my position, along with being a student. I've become an EMT, I'm finishing up my dual degree in computer science and mathematics, my relationships with the people who matter most to me are at an all time high.

Sometimes it gets really lonely, dark, empty....lifeless...but that's not true. Your life is full of life because YOU'RE alive. You have so much potential. You just need to tap into it.

He was crying as he soaked his scraped knee with water in the bathtub. I looked at him with disdain. \"Why are you crying?\" I asked in annoyance. I didn't realize it then, but my visceral reaction to his emotional vulnerability reflected something that I had been taught earlier in my childhood: boys aren't supposed to cry. When I became a young adult, I had a lot of trouble expressing my emotions. I put on a smile for everyone I saw, and avoided talking about anything that would trigger an emotional reaction. When my emotions built up to the point where I couldn‚Äôt control them, I would explode. It took a long time to learn how to share my feelings - something that people still consider to be a sign of weakness in men. I think I‚Äôm one of the millions of men out there who‚Äôve been told, at some point in their lives, to repress their emotions. I now understand how emotional repression can lead to a variety of complications in mental health. I wrote a song to challenge the idea that men shouldn‚Äôt show their feelings simply because they are men. Listen link below. For all the guys out there listening to this song - be vulnerable. Feel your emotions. Share with others how you feel. I think that‚Äôs even more manly than being a tough guy. Thank you guys so much for reading this. Please be safe, everyone. xoxo Listen here: "

Now I got a job and a place to stay and my mental health seems to be improving a lot I think is important to share some positive news as well since sometimes we just come here in our lowest times, and I shared here previously when I thought I was at one of the direst moments of my life. It has been two weeks, I was basically out of money in a new city, have searched everywhere for a job but couldn't find any, so I decided to go to the social services center at the town hall to see if they could help me anyway. Shared with the staff my story and how I was going to be homeless that same day, but since it is a small city, the social worker contacted a friend of hers that owned a place that was looking for a woman to cook, clean and receive guests at a private tourist attraction. Although I'm male, she decided to give me a chance, and so it has been two weeks of hard work but everything is working out so far. I actually like the job a lot, and my employer seems to be quite happy with my performance and already increased my salary from past week. My anxiety and depression are way under control now. It seems that since my work requires more doing and less thinking it just keeps my mind better focused in the job and been glad for this opportunity that while I still get some intrusive thoughts once in a while, they are way less aggressive than they were in the past few months/years. So that is it. Just sharing a story with a better ending than I expected so that, maybe, it give those of you guys who are still facing harder times, a glimmer of hope that things may get better for you too. Is a bit cheesy, but in the end, hope is sometimes all that we have left, and guts to keep on fighting wherever way you can."

After a split second of worrying I may be stepping into a domestic violence and, thus, dangerous situation, I knew I needed to help either way. So I ran up and said I could help. That's when I realized she was holding a non-responsive, not breathing baby. Time slowed down. I stashed my dog inside her front door, took the baby, and narrated each step of heimlich, sweeping the mouth, etc. I was eerily calm. And the baby started crying! I had to do it a second time when she stopped breathing again. Meanwhile, the woman who was her grandmother was on the phone with 911 and, understandably, in such a panic. The police came first, because neighbors called about the screaming. Then the ambulance a bit after that and a good 5-10 minutes after I got there. I feel so so lucky I happened to be there and somehow remembered lifeguard training from 15 years ago. And I feel humbled in like a pre-social media definition of it. And I feel weird that all the other neighbors were watching but no one came to help. And most of all, I just feel raw. Like I feel really weird about it all and like I'm exposed. Extra weird thing is I saved someone kayaking 10 days prior. I have never saved anyone's life before. And two have two in 10 days as a regular person / non-first responder, and especially the baby two days ago, I am just shaken up."

I feel as if I should just accept my inherent worthlessness and just save everyone the trouble of me breathing their air. I don‚Äôt want to reach out to people who know me because I don‚Äôt want to worry them. And I certainly don‚Äôt want them thinking I‚Äôm just looking for attention or validation. My therapist is also not being super helpful. I am not sure I‚Äôve made much progress. What should I do if it happens again? I don‚Äôt want to burden everyone else."

I‚Äôve been thinking about this for days, I guess I just want to know I‚Äôm not the only one who feels this way."

We're getting there üí™üòä Mental health improving üíïüíñ It's been three days since I've been folowing this path of self improvement. My room used to be an utter mess, I started arranging my bed & also made it a habit to make it first thing in the morning. Bought a pair of dumbbells and trained the biceps. Also invested in a skipping rope to get the blood pumping. I've been watching a lot of Jordan Peterson lectures lately. In the past I used to waste my time aimlessly but now I can learn to manage my time and also increased the productivity. Hardly use any sort of social media other than YouTube. I can see that implementing these habits in my lifestyle , my mental health is improving as I'm keeing myself engaged and investing my time into things that are benefical and will pay off in the long run.

Jesus fuck I'm trying so hard but I feel like no matter what I'll keep failing. I am genuinely interested in what I'm studying, but I'm so behind and have such bad work ethic now, I don't understand even the basics. I feel like an absolute idiot. I had this grand plan when I left highschool. I wanted to study outside of the US. It was really difficult to find a way to do it, but I had a dream and I was so determined to accomplish it. But depression hit me bad and I almost didn't graduate highschool, my parents didn't support me and I wasn't able to go to college because of it so I was forced to take a gap year. I broke my foot and was bed ridden for 6 months and became very depressed. Finally got to uni and failed the first year. Just failed my 2nd. I'm basically at 0 credits and 3 years behind where I'm supposed to be. My twin brother is almost graduating and I'm basically exactly where I was when I left highschool. I feel like I'm losing years off my life and for some reason I can't just live it. Not to mention there's a lot of shitty things going on on top of all this and I just feel so fucking alone. I feel a loss of motivation to do anything. I don't know what to do anymore. I feel alone and unsupported, and so so afraid. I have no idea what my future holds, and I no longer have a dream. I just want to be happy again."

I quickly picked it up and in my fury said \"fucking bullshit\" and \"I will not allow this seagull to get the better of me and stop me enjoying this hotdog I paid for\" and quickly ate it anyway. Gross I know but it was a very quick nip and it was on the ground for less than a second. Anyway after I ate it I started getting anxious about \"what if I contract bird flu and die\" and started to overthink a lot about what diseases I could get and so on. I started to think about if I died how much I'd miss my friends, my family and how there's so much I still want to do like meet my future wife, have a family, help people, build a career, play xbox, play with my dog and enjoy surfing etc. And because of this I realised how much I actually want to be here and how much I love being alive and don't want to leave. A few months ago I was in a really dark place and I was getting scared I'd never see the light and it would just keep going downhill, and today a seagull stole my hotdog and I realised how happy I am and how far I've come, and I'm really proud of myself for improving my mental health and look forward to all the beautiful and exciting things to come in future. Hopefully you had a laugh at this situation like I did, and maybe find something in it if you're struggling. And watch out for those airborne demons next time you get a hotdog. Tldr: a seagull stole my hotdog and it made me realise how much I want to be alive and how many good things there are currently and are yet to come in my life."

Not saying its a good idea, but being able to give up your own life just to make everyone a little happier (even if it doesn't actually, but just in the person's head) is not selfish. It's horrible, tragic, but not selfish. &#x200B; EDIT: I'm not suicidal by the way and dudes stop insinuating suicide is okay when you have a mental illness.

There are ups and downs to this feeling, though it never goes away completely. Sometimes it gets very bad for a very brief moment, but even then I am able to perform daily tasks, I take care for my dog, I keep myself and my flat \\[relatively\\] clean, I even eat well. I'm reliable. My job situation is not the best, but I somehow manage from paycheck to paycheck. I manage, I just struggle *inside* all the time. There is not a day that I don't feel (at least) \"a little down\". Whenever I feel like seeking help, I remember some people I've known who were diagnosed with depression. Some couldn't get out of bed for weeks, some seemed to have disappeared from the face of earth for months. Many self-harmed. Compared to them I'm completely fine, just oddly upset, resigned and a little fearful 24/7. I feel like I'd be wasting a psychiatrist's time with my crap. On the other hand I think that I backed myself into a corner. I'm keeping my head above water, so I'm not drowning, but I can't get out of the water either, because I'm too weak. Can I be depressed?

Let me fucking tell you something. I am so sick and tired of hearing people say that suicide is selfish. You want to know what's fucking selfish? Expecting someone else to live for you. Expecting someone to put their own personal pain to the side for your fucking happiness. Expecting your relationship or companionship to be that saving grace to pull anyone through a deep depression. THAT is the epitomy of selfish. It is no one's responsibility to do anything that makes other people happy or comfortable. You are not owed any of that. You don't get to tell someone who's suicidal that they're selfish for considering it and that they should think about others egos before their suffering. You don't get to call someone selfish after they commit suicide because they didn't think about everyone else's feelings when they obviously couldn't even handle their own. On top of the fact that it's disrespectful to speak ill of the dead. How selfish do you have to be to have the audacity to call someone selfish when you are the one who wants a dangerously depressed person to continue suffering just so you can continue to ignore all the symptoms but hand them a god damn gold start sticker for being alive like it fucking helps anything? And before you even bring religion into the conversation, news flash, Not everyone believes in your God so telling someone \"God doesn't make mistakes\", \"Suicide is a sin\", \"God only gives us what we can handle\", or some other idiotic bullshit, doesn't bring everyone comfort and sometimes it makes things worse. And that's not your opportunity to tell them all the ways they need to find God. Because again: Not. Everyone. Believes. In. Your. Fucking. God. End of. Telling a suicidal person that wanting to end their pain is selfish will only tell them that they cannot confide in you and it marks you as an unreliable support system. It will more than likely make them pull away from you and make them feel even more isolated. YOU'RE NOT HELPING! And don't use the excuses \"I've been through worse and I don't want to kill myself\" or \"Other people have it worse\" because you obviously don't understand what mental illness is. Being depressed about a situation is so much different than being clinically depressed. Situational depression lasts through a particular struggle. Clinical depression is being sad for almost no god damn reason. Don't compare the two because you're only making yourself look like more of an asshole. It is selfish of you to want someone to continue suffering just to make you happy. Get off your fucking high horse."

    "text": "It‚Äôs been 10 years since my suicide attempt and I‚Äôm so glad I didn‚Äôt succeed!! Somehow I missed my 10 year anniversary of the worst day of my life. I suppose that‚Äôs a good thing that I‚Äôm so involved with the good bits of life now that I almost forgot that this wasn‚Äôt always the case. Ten years ago I threw my legs out a 6th floor window at college, intending to hit the earth below me. I was in the thick of some really terrible times then. I was 19, heartbroken, homesick, lost, and very confused. I remember the sharp air that rushed in the room when I opened the window that very cold and snowy February night. It felt like little needles on my skin; a stark contrast to the hot, salty tears streaming down my face. I was in trouble for drinking on campus...again. However, the drinking wasn‚Äôt just purely fun and games. I was using it to cope with a lot of uncertainty and hopelessness. My on again off again boyfriend told me he was dating someone else. He lived with my best guy friend at the time so a lot of ‚Äúsides‚Äù were taken in the whole mess. And somewhere along the way my roommate moved out. I was alone. I spent the remainder of the week at the hospital under psychiatric care. The days I spent there blur together now. I was in such a haze of numbness. My entire life was uprooted. I got kicked out of college and I had to start over somewhere new. The next several years were spent kicking my ass into gear to show myself and the friends who abandoned me that they didn‚Äôt get the best of me. I pushed and pushed myself. I started looking forward and not backward. I learned to love myself again. Slowly. Very slowly. I graduated from a new (and better) college with honors two years later. I took a chance and bought a one way ticket to NYC and began living the life I used to only be able to dream about. 10 years later, I am living proof that things get better. Depression and anxiety are challenges I still deal with occasionally, but now I know how to handle it. Right now I‚Äôm sitting in the house I just bought all by myself. I‚Äôm reminiscing about the years I spent living and working in Manhattan, where I had an incredible job and amazing friends. Most days, my life felt like a happy movie. I recently decided to re-locate, slow things down and enjoy the present. Now I‚Äôm in the process of renovating my house from the inside out. I volunteer with an organization that raises funds for underprivileged women and children. I carve out time for my hobbies, friends, and loved ones. I‚Äôve truly become a better person. I can now enjoy a glass or two of wine without overdoing it just to cope. I can take a deep breath, a small sip, and appreciate how far I‚Äôve come. I still have a long way to go. I‚Äôm still a work in progress. I haven‚Äôt found love yet but I look forward to the day I do. In the meantime, you can catch me cultivating my new herb garden and reading a good book or two. If you‚Äôre going through what I went through 10 years ago, my best advice is to hang on, know it does get better (and no this isn‚Äôt something that people just say. It‚Äôs true). You‚Äôre not alone. You‚Äôre loved. And you‚Äôre stronger than you think. Take a deep breath, be thankful that you are able to do so, and repeat until you truly believe better days are around the corner. TLDR - I‚Äôm 10 years post-suicide attempt and better than ever. I wanted to share my accomplishment with you all and hope this story might help someone."

I really just wanted to celebrate this somehow, because I‚Äôm proud of myself for making it this far even though it‚Äôs hard sometimes. To anyone else recovering from S.H., I believe in you. You can do it, even if your mind is trying to tell you otherwise. You‚Äôre always stronger than you think. Sometimes, things don‚Äôt necessarily get easier, but you get stronger and better at dealing with them. :) Edit: thank you so much to everyone who has commented!! It really means a lot to me to hear that this actually is a big achievement, especially because I was kind of talking myself out of it aha. I‚Äôm trying to reply to every comment because I really appreciate all the support and encouragement from you guys <3"

I really had no motivation to do anything and the only thing I've been doing is my school work and I have no motivation to do that also but I'm too anxious not to do it and other than that I just lay in bed all day doing nothing.

I isolated form everything and I distanced myself from my family and friends, I live in the same house as my parents and my siblings yet I barely speak to them and I haven't spoken to my friends in so long they have been messaging and calling me but I've just been ignoring their calls and leaving their messages on read and I'm such a horrible friend for doing so I don't even know how to explain what's been going on to them and honestly I wouldn't blame them if they didn't want to be friends with me anymore.

    "text": "I've spent 90% of my freetime in bed since I was 12 As the title says I've been bedrotting since I was 12. I spend most of my time laying in my bed. I can't sit upright in chairs because my posture is only used to laying in bed. I enjoy eating in my bed. I feel safe in my bed. When I was younger I didn't spend all my time in bed because I had friends and activities to do. I could sit upright in chairs without being in pain. I don't know how to live like that anymore. It's been almost a decade since, I'm not familiar with it. For fun I crochet in bed. I draw in bed. I watch videos in bed. I get a dopamine rush when I think about all the fun things I could do with my life. I fantasize about how good I would have it if I had friends and didn't rot away in bed everyday. I don't know if this is hope or delusion. I make an effort not to lay in bed all day sometimes. But usually it's just so comforting to lay in bed because every other alternative is so strange and unfamiliar. People tell me to just get out of bed, but I'm split between wanting to and not wanting to. I don't know what I'm supposed to do when not in bed. I could do what I do in bed while sitting in a chair instead. But then my neck and back hurts. I could go for walks but I'm so tired, and nobody wants to walk with me. I could go alone but then I might as well just be in bed. I don't feel like I exist when no one sees me. My life is on standby. I can just rot because no one will judge me. Don't get me wrong though. I don't want to have it like this. I want to be normal and be able to make friends and enjoy life outside of bed. I just don't understand how I'm supposed to. And everytime I try I end up feeling worse. I want to turn back and out of this lifestyle but I don't know how to. No one helped me in the start. Now it's so much harder. But I don't feel like I can reach out for help. Everyone has it so much worse than me. I have it easy compared to most. I have reached out for some help, but I don't think they understand. When I have to get out of bed I get ready in the bathroom. I look very presentable. I don't look like someone who can't get out of bed for mundane tasks. Because I show up to my appointments on time, clean and groomed. I can get out of bed for the tasks I understand. I understand taking a shower and going to the bathroom. I understand \"hanging out\" the few times it happens. I understand having to be somewhere at a certain time. I understand eating when I feel hungry. But I don't understand preparing a meal for mealtime or brushing my teeth in the morning and evening. Most of the time I forget, and other times I tell myself I'll do it the next time I get out of bed, only to forget. I don't understand self respect and getting out of bed for my own good. I only get out of bed for others. Now when I don't have others I don't know what to do Maybe I just stay in bed because I really really hate myself. I claim not to but actions speak louder than words."

I am not looking forward to my future, I don't want it. I spent my adolence trying to avoid being molested and hit by men, and now that I have aged out of being \"hot and young\", no one wants me at all. The only up side is that I can do things like math and have calm thoughts because I my nervous system isn't in living in constant terror of cornered, touched, forced to fawn, or escape a situation. I hate sex so much and I do not want a man touching me. I hate this culture obessessed with it. I don't know my worth as human, because women have always been cruel to me, and men always touching me.

I have gone to therapists and have come back empty handed and with alot of money wasted, I am also currently on medication, that I often forget to take, and that helps, but will eventually not help anymore. I only have 2 friends I actively speak to, but even then we don't do much. I don't have anyone to call with, I don't have anyone to play games with. It feels so awful to come home from school and lay in my bed all day till I eventually fall asleep because I don't have enough motivation to finish projects or get up to do anything. I really need some support and validation, as I live and breathe off stupid things like that. I have been staying alive for this long due to people in my life complimenting little things I do, and I'm aware it's an issue. I hate myself for it.

    "text": "How much/frequent self harm justifies a 400 dollar therapy session So sometimes when I get really depressed (I am not consistently depressed, I just get depressed sometimes, say about once a month or few months) I'll bang my forehead on a nearby wall or like hit it with my fist. Today I also puked a little bit it might also be BC I ate smth weird for dinner. But I guess I don't know if this is enough?? To justify getting expensive as therapy. Id personally find it really humiliating telling someone about that and having them know i said it (as in kind of non-anonymous internet person). Is there a normal/manageable amount of kind of self harm ig???"

    "text": "Laziness (18F) My room is a mess, I haven't brushed my teeth for a few days, I spend most days in bed or sitting at my desk waiting for the work to start itself, I don't get enough sleep or I sleep through the entire day, I eat shit, hardly drink enough water. I feel so so lazy. I used to be someone with ambition and drive. Now I just sit in my bed after school and on my weekends. Some days I can't even get out of bed for school. I don't want to self diagnose or anything but I think I've gone a long time with undiagnosed ADD which has caused me to spiral this past year or two because of the increased intensity and pressure in school work and struggling to get normal things done. Being in class or watching a video and barely picking up any information whilst I'm distracted and my classmates retaining that informational immediately is tiring. Knowing I want to do good and struggling to get started on small tasks because of how much energy it takes now is exhausting. And now? I'm just lazy. I wanted to get into med school and maybe if I had tried harder, it would've worked. I just received my rejection letters after interviews. I broke up with my boyfriend of a year around a month ago. To top it off, I have abusive immigrant parents. My grades aren't going to improve because I know what I'm like. It also seems as though whenever things start to improve, I always get dragged back down. I'm tired. There's no point. I'm not good enough for ANYONE. It's even more confusing when over a year ago, I was doing okay before I started the last two years of school. I was going to the gym, in good shape, eating super good, funny and charismatic around my friends and had a great boyfriend. Then I started to get involved in arguments with my parents, getting verbally abused and screamed at in front of my face, having to run away from home. Then everything started to go downhill. Now I feel like my life is over. Although in 2021 I had gone through a similar type of episode and I think it's worse this time round. I wish there was an easy fix. I might go see my doctor finally because I just don't believe I'm depressed, my whole life I've been told others have it worse. My inability to do things makes me feel awful and is causing me to give up on everything and fantasise about suicide if only I didn't feel so bad leaving everyone behind with guilt or hatred towards me. However, I've started to feel more selfish about it. I might go through with it in April. My whole existence has been a mistake and all I do is ruminate on everything. My venting doesn't get me anywhere and I can't pull myself up and out of this horrible pit of sadness that I've gotten myself into. I just need help or an escape. I don't want to be this way, I hate it this way."

Ever since i was little, i was the one doing the chores. My parents made me do things way beyond my age like washing other's underwear at 8 or cooking when i was barely in middle school. If i refused or didn't do it well enough i got severely punished. I think these experiences traumatized me because my memories are foggy but i know lots of things like that happened. Now that my mom has a small shop, she expects me to take care of everything at home whenever i don't have classes. I have to wake up early, stay at the shop, clean and cook sometimes. Our house isnt really small so i feel like i do endless physical labor, yet it's never enough for them. Meanwhile, my siblings make a mess and throw things everywhere and i have to clean up after them constantly. They're 18 and 14. When i try to talk to my mom about how exhausting it is, she just dismisses me saying things like \"you think you're just going to live here for free ?\" or \"you should do that because you're always asking for money anyway \". As if i owe them something just for existing. I get that parents provide for their kids but isn't that what they chose to do by having children ? Why does she expect me to handle her responsibilities ? I already help way more than i should i think. And yet, i feel like im losing my time and my youth for nothing because i can't do anything else (they don't really let me, mostly if it requires money) and i don't even earn anything from all this. I mean we''re not even poor i can tell that we're kind of stable. That's why im always frustrated and irritated. And when i express it suddenly im the villain because they don't understand why i feel this way. But im not just physically tired im also mentally exhausted. I can't do anything for myself. I can't even read a book without being interrupted because people come to shop at the grocery. I feel like i have no space, no freedom, nothing of my own. I‚Äôm exhausted i can't take it anymore and i feel like no one in my family even sees how much this is draining me because we kids OWE OUR LIVES TO OUR PARENTS WTF"

They both started at a young age and both I believe are due to my childhood trauma. I unfortunately went through some pretty bad stuff and vividly remember bits and pieces. Most of those memories my mind has repressed and I do not recall alot. But I do believe as an adult, the trauma I went through had an enormous impact on the depression and anxiety I to through today. I know there are other variable cues that I deal with and researched. I am looking for suggestions from people who can relate and point me in the direction that will help. It is so hard for me to stay happy. Just like a wave I can feel the depression taking over and it is a war inside my head to try and stop it from happening.

Nothing extravagant, but enough, better than I could have imagined from back then when I was an alcoholic who had nothing at all. The thing is I've always treated life as if it was a bucket list. If you have financial comfort, If you had a loving spouse, friends, good grades, hobbies, favourite games, a loving family ‚Äî then surely you're supposed to be happy? I still feel nothing. Not quite sad but just nothing. I thought striving for a better version of myself and my life would extinguish this feeling of emptiness.

So I‚Äôve been taking the antidepressant Effexor for the past 6 months, a fast acting SNRI, and have noticed sustainable improvement to my overall clarity and mood. However, I did notice that there was a certain aspect of life that I was missing out on, the beauty I once saw, the light that used to shimmer. So after some independent research I decided to try the drug DXM along with my SNRI. I‚Äôve been taking 100mg of DXM daily for the past 2 weeks, and have noticed nothing except for positive changes. I‚Äôm making this post not to promote the use of DXM for depression, but to simply give my experience in hope that it may help somebody else along the way. Love."

    "text": "Hollow but Smiling I‚Äôm 16F, and I‚Äôve been trying to figure myself out for a while now. The more I think about it, the more I realize I don‚Äôt really care about anyone. Like, at all. I don‚Äôt even think I want to care, but I know it‚Äôs expected, so I‚Äôm trying to act the part. Not because I actually want to be more empathetic, but because I was raised by loving parents, and I want them to see me as ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù It just makes things easier. I‚Äôm a perfectionist, which makes everything feel like a cycle of frustration. I lose interest in things and get bored so easily. Nothing holds my attention for long unless it constantly keeps me on edge. That, combined with how I see people, makes me feel kind of disconnected from everything. I have no emotional attachment to anyone, and I‚Äôve lost any sympathy or empathy I used to have for real people. But weirdly enough, I can still cry over fictional characters. That‚Äôs what made me start testing myself‚Äîwatching disturbing things just to see if I‚Äôd feel anything. I haven‚Äôt actually done it yet, but the thought is there. I‚Äôve self-diagnosed with dysesthesia and symptoms of BPD, which might explain a lot of the emotional numbness I feel. But I don‚Äôt talk about it with anyone. I avoid bringing up my problems because I don‚Äôt want to worry anyone‚Äîespecially my family. At the same time, I feel lonely and isolated. It‚Äôs a weird contradiction‚Äîgiving up on people but still wanting emotional connections. I used to skip college a lot, not because of academics (studies are ridiculously easy for me), but because I didn‚Äôt want people pitying me for being alone, lonely, and smart. My father‚Äôs reputation plays a huge role in how I conduct myself in school‚Äîhe‚Äôs a well-respected person in a high position, so I‚Äôm always expected to be at the top. That part never bothered me because I actually like proving I‚Äôm smarter than most people my age. Maybe that‚Äôs narcissism, but I enjoy meeting high expectations. I‚Äôve been sick and depressed since high school, and my parents worried about me a lot. Sometimes, I used that to my advantage‚Äîplaying the sick victim card to get what I wanted. Not that I was always faking, but I knew how to use their concern. I guess I‚Äôm manipulative in that sense. But at the same time, people close to me never really care about my preferences. Conversations are always about them, never about me. My older sibling, who‚Äôs extroverted and great at connecting with people, is basically everyone‚Äôs favorite, which makes me feel inferior in comparison. I tried communicating with them, but they just aren‚Äôt the type to handle serious conversations. Whenever I talk to my parents (my dad is logical, my mom is emotional), they either over-worry or just try to rationalize everything instead of actually listening to me. Now they expect me to study non-stop for my career, even telling me to cut my sleep because they don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm serious enough. I am serious, but my mental health makes it hard to focus. At this point, I‚Äôve just decided to make pretending my first nature. If I can act the way people expect me to, I won‚Äôt have to deal with questions or concerns. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a bad thing‚Äîit‚Äôs just a skill I need to function in society. But sometimes, I do wonder‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs actually wrong with me?"

My brain is constantly yelling at me that there is no point when I do creative work, that I'm pretty much just wearing myself out and my work in general has become mind-numbing and repetitive because that's what's easiest. I still get a small spark of joy for seeing my work complete, but it's a speck compared to what I used to feel, although I've been able to cry again lately, so that's a good sign.

I did feel worse for a while on it, and now that im cutting back idk if i feel even worse or numbed out ? i haven't been able to leave my room in a week. have just been sitting in my bed the whole time except to get out once to smoke at night to help me sleep and another time to eat something. can't push myself to the most basic things such as take a shower or brush my teeth. i feel like shit sitting in my bed but i can't push myself to get up unless i absolutely have to or for something i want like the weed at night. my mom knows i have clinical depression but says this isn't depression. the way im acting isn't. i told her to look up the definition (she also is a medical worker) but she says she knows. she also says she knows it's different for everyone, but still insists that isn't the case for me. i just don't know if im actually just being lazy and don't want to do what u have to do, or if the depression is at play a little here ? i know people can be depressed and get a job and do what they have to do in life. but i can't seem to do any of that rn and maybe it is partly me just being lazy and not wanting to do it. i'm not sure. if anyone also has any tips of what has worked for you to get ur motivation back up, what pushes you to actually do the things you need to do ? what gives you that energy ?"

I had been doing so good since about 2023 after my last ‚Äúattempt‚Äù and stopped sh completely as well. I got into a beautiful and healthy relationship and we‚Äôve been together for over a year.

For the past ~few~ months it‚Äôs been getting bad again, I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd start sh again but I failed that a couple weeks ago. I kept everything functional, I reached out when I needed it. I still go to work, take care of my cat and other household chores, as well as my relationships. I still however feel an overwhelming sense of emptiness, I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm meant to be alive and I‚Äôve had this recurring thought since I was a kid. I never understood what being a human was like, I‚Äôve always felt misunderstood and like an alien just wasting a spot on this earth. My birth wasn‚Äôt planned, nobody knew about me for two months, kind of ironic since I also grew up as a ‚Äúglass child‚Äù with copious amounts of suicidal tendencies. I don‚Äôt belong, I can‚Äôt really connect with people as I want to. I‚Äôm drowning my days off work with smoking weed, nic, drinking shit vodka while popping a few kpins.

Couple weeks ago I crashed out and I cried in my car alone, my parents don't know, the only way for me to express my depression is through loud sigh and anger. No one knows. I felt relieved from crying but it still hurts, knowing I don't have the qualities that will allow me to have her. Not tall enough, good looking enough, not muscular enough, not being enough. I've never asked her directly, I wish I have the gut to get to know the truth instead of being miserable and just loafing around, the gym don't help, screaming out loud don't help, nothing felt right. I wanna bury myself in the dirt, I want to forget about everything and what I even lived for. I know it's just a girl but it hurts and I don't know where it hurts or which way it's hurting from. I guess this is just dopamine for us human beings, just so we can feel motivated and survive. I sometime put the music loud af and stared into deep sorrow night, to see if I can have some peace and quiet from my pain, as time goes by I'll probably forget about her but I wish I was the one. I envy my brothers and my men who can stand for so long being so strong, I wish I was like that. My heart is beating fast, like butter flies in my stomach feeling, I haven't gotten any sleep. I sometimes wish the world can share my pain and I wish I was the center of her attention. I wish I was something special so I can grab her attention and feel happy. Why do I have deep desire for someone who don't even know I exist? Why do I feel so much sorrow and pain for someone who won't even look my way? Should I be a fool, so she'll look my way for a split sec? Will I be happy? Deep sorrows cut like sharp knives. I rather be heart broken knowing I was with her and it did not work out rather then to be delusional and make up fantasy about being with her. I tried to keep my composure whenever I see her talk to men. I gotta be strong. Well, I guess it was a privilege to be born in the same era as her. Sorry about the vent, I'll try to go sleep now, I don't want to look like a pop-eyed goldfish."

Existence can feel absurd and futile. Have you ever gazed at the stars and questioned the purpose of our creation, only to meet our demise? Have you felt the weight of inevitability pressing down on you? Did you ever discover genuine purpose in your life? Why do some believe they are above helping those in need? Have you ever been so engulfed in despair that you saw death as a release from this heartless world, pleading with the universe for peace? Have you ever offered help out of pure compassion, rather than seeking validation from others? Have you ever mocked someone struggling with depression, struggling to pay bills, struggling with a sickness,assuming life is easy for everyone else? Why did you choose to bully that outcast, who harmed no one, only to label him the villain when he finally stood up for himself? Why do you think you are superior to someone lacking in looks, wealth, or social status? In a world so fleeting, why do these superficial measures hold such weight? When did we lose our humanity? Why does society breed monsters and then play the victim when they retaliate? Why do people acknowledge the mental health crisis yet fail to take action to support those suffering, instead casting them aside? Why is our world so fixated on materialism, filled with deception? Among all the species in the universe, why did humanity emerge as such selfish and cruel beings? Why do we witness mass shootings week after week? Why are those marginalized treated poorly when they seek retribution against a society that has cast them aside? Why is it so difficult to simply be kind?

    "text": "My back is against the wall constantly And this is before I realized that I may have a issue the type of issue that‚Äôs not going to go away. The type of issue that‚Äôs genetic and the type of issue that‚Äôs here to stay. I let people convince me that I was being dramatic and I had nothing to be sad about, in some cases they were right but I couldn‚Äôt even stop myself from being sad. I even use to get beatings because my parents thought I was being ungrateful when it happened at a young age. I‚Äôm in a position right now where I feel like I‚Äôm grieving my life constantly because I allow my depression control me. No matter how much I fight back this shit comes out of nowhere and sometimes without reasons, I can‚Äôt even handle simple life stress without feeling the need to turn extra hard at a light because I want to end my life or look at anti depressants because I want to overdose on them. I wanted to be someone‚Äôs girlfriend, wife, friend and co worker/boss but I don‚Äôt want to live decades of this, the cycle of only feeling okay two months out of a whole year is draining. Not being able to have friendships because if they find out about this then I‚Äôm now labeled as that crazy friend/ with mental issues that you have to walk egg shells around. Not being able to be a mother because what if I feel like this and my babies are in the car or I‚Äôm not doing simple responsibilities as a mother because I‚Äôm mentally drained out or what if I passed this down to them? It already makes me uncomfortable that I‚Äôm being labeled as that in my family already. Even if people don‚Äôt say it to your face it‚Äôs still there. Can‚Äôt even take a bath without feeling like I need to put my head under water for hours."

    "text": "Advice for Self-Hatred Most days, I can function to some extent, but for most of my waking hours, I stress about my physical flaws. I worry most about my height and my hair. I recognize it could be far more worse, but I can‚Äôt stop feeling like I‚Äôll never be happy. I can't interact with attractive people without feeling intensely envious or unhappy. I wish I didn‚Äôt care at all, but I do to an unhealthy extent. The fact that ugliness is still socially acceptable to mock just makes this nightmare feeling even more real. It‚Äôs crazy how, even in my own friend group, the tallest guy is the most respected and happiest, while the shortest has the most problems in his life. I mean, I can‚Äôt count how many times the jokes write themselves. I know I'm overly sensitive, and posting about my problems online probably isn‚Äôt the best idea, but what other options do I have? Mindfulness, SSRIs, and CBT didn't help at all. How happy can you really be when you know you're not separate from nature and your chances of experiencing 'love' are determined by things entirely outside of your control? The only thing that actually makes a difference is socializing with people I feel close to. But no matter how hard I try, I can't seem to move past the acquaintance phase now. All my old friends moved on to different colleges, and now I spend my time online and alone, struggling to care about my future, knowing it's just going to get worse with age. What can I do to not feel 'bad'? Is there really any other conclusion to draw from this, other than that I‚Äôm just another dysgenic person who's too self-aware?"

I grew up poor with neglectful parents, with a dad that literally tried to kill me before my mom divorced him and I was removed from his care. I worked hard because I didn‚Äôt want to be in poverty anymore and I wanted a happy life. Well that got me no where. I went to college got a bachelor‚Äôs degree in biology and now I work at Barnes and noble where I‚Äôm severely under appreciated and under paid despite how hard I work. I take pills to feel better but they just make me not care, my body cry‚Äôs but I don‚Äôt care. I love others but I can‚Äôt feel loved. I want to quit my job but I can‚Äôt because again I live in poverty. There‚Äôs barely enough food in the house to last a week at all times. I love animals and wanted to be a vet but whats the point I‚Äôll just be in more debt then I already am an be depressed about how poorly people treat there animals. I‚Äôm dating someone but it‚Äôs not going anywhere because again I can‚Äôt feel loved. I don‚Äôt enjoy my hobbies, I can‚Äôt draw, can‚Äôt play video game, I read books but I don‚Äôt like them, nothing fills the void, the meds just make me not feel but I know deep down I‚Äôm not living anymore. I‚Äôm just going through the motions. When my dog dies that probably be it for me then again i probably won‚Äôt feel anything at all so who cares. Thanks for listening to my rant"

    "text": "20F life is falling apart TW: mental health, family drama, stress etc Hi, I‚Äôm 20 and currently in college. I‚Äôm on academic probation and failing out of school. I was recently hospitalized with 7 stomach ulcers and I am through intense mental and physical health struggles. I‚Äôm in therapy twice a week and on medication, but things keep getting worse. My single mom had to take on over $100k of debt to keep me in school, and she doesn‚Äôt have a job. I‚Äôm terrified for us financially. We‚Äôve always struggled, but it feels like everything is collapsing this year. I‚Äôve also been involved in a traumatic family lawsuit since I was 8 years old, and over the past year I‚Äôve had to take an active role in it. I‚Äôm still waiting on a judgment related to finances that we were depending on, and I‚Äôve heard nothing. Because of the case, my grandfather suddenly stopped talking to me and cut me off emotionally and financially. The stress has caused my mom and I to fight so much she‚Äôs lovely but so stressed herself. To make things worse, my younger brother hasn‚Äôt spoken to me in over a year since I came out to him as gay. He was the one person I thought understood me ‚Äî now I feel like I‚Äôve lost him too. I feel like I can‚Äôt go home to take time off of school because it will lead to so much fighting with how my mental health is. I‚Äôm not rlly able to do anything at all. I quit my dance team, distanced from friends, and feel like I‚Äôve withdrawn from everything. Even my previously happy and healthy relationship is struggling now due to all this stress. My dad left when I was 8 and has never spoken to me since. My family feels broken, and I feel completely alone in the world. I know I‚Äôm doing what I can ‚Äî therapy, medication ‚Äî but nothing seems to touch the pain of losing family, financial safety, or the legal stress. I just don‚Äôt know where to begin. How do I start putting my life back together?"

At first I am in a big group of students who came from the same country like me. But then I feel like I came all the way here so I want to make more domestic friends. So me & my bff isolated ourselves from the group & just go together so there‚Äôs two of us only. We tried out many things together & lives have been better because we are meeting more meaningful people. However, we never truly make any more friends whom we could hang out with, it‚Äôs always just a ‚Äòwaving & hi‚Äô with them. I have only her & she has only me, which is kinda frustrating sometimes because if she‚Äôs busy im alone & if im busy she is. Today my college has a big event going on and the party is very big. I want to go to a party at 12a & have fun but she wants to go to bed. I know why she don't want to go. Because every time she went out in a frat, we just like, just two of us dancing together. And it's so hard to talk to people in a frat, especially when you don't know them beforehand. They're sticking to their own friend groups. It's not like you can make friends with strangers. We've been to many frat parties, but it's not working out. That's why we stepped back a little and she lost hope with it. But I still want to go and enjoy the fun & I dont rlly care if we talk to anyone or not I want the music and the vibe of youth. I have no one else I could go with, so I have to stay at home, I am so upset because everyone else was screaming & happy & enjoying the party outside I could hear the noise, and Im in my bed miserable wanting to go but I cant because my only friend doesnt want to. This has happened so many times, I cant bear with it anymore I am so upset so frustrated but I dont know what to do. I am so miserable I feel so helpless. I dont want to talk to her I am mad at her but if I dont i am alone what should I do?"

The last 4 years have been a series of court cases, police interviews and 3 years ago at 5.30am the police raided our house and pulled me off the toilet. This may sound minor but ever since then, I have not been the same. I've taken so many substances, that I never thought I would try. When I was 11, I wanted to be a Doctor. That's what I thought about when I was stood with a rolled up note in my hand hovering over lines of crystal meth. My husband has always been a supporter of me taking drugs. So many sleeping tablets, that I can't remember life before my husband. The latest shit storm I've been dragged into, another court case is this week. I've never broken the law and it makes me so so sad that the authorities are always in my life. I work and my husband does not, I'm so so sad that I long to be left alone. But this doesn't happen, in a way I think the job is the only thing keeping me here. Ive tried to make us both happy, I took us on 2 breaks away to Europe and as soon as we got to the the hotel on each break, my husband would not speak and would limp around both cities shouting with pain that he didn't have at home. These 2 breaks where what kept me going, and he has shown me that it doesn't matter what I'm excited for, or how bad I need a break. He will not give it me.

    "text": "My parents want to kick me out, I have ‚Ç¨6 and no support what can I do? Hey everyone, I‚Äôm a 20-year-old guy, still living with my parents and my little sister. My mom doesn‚Äôt work anymore; she‚Äôs always at home. She has mental health issues, like thinking everyone is out to get her. To explain what kind of relationship I have with her: in the past, I fell into depression. We went to a psychiatrist, who prescribed me antidepressants. But she wasn‚Äôt satisfied with my diagnosis. She desperately wanted me to have bipolar disorder, even though I clearly didn‚Äôt. She took me to several other psychiatrists, lying about me so they would prescribe neuroleptics. She even tried to convince me that I was bipolar. Then, she tried to convince everyone else that I was crazy and had anger issues, even though I obviously didn‚Äôt. She told people that if she was sick, it was only because of me. She even told them she was scared I was going to kill her in her sleep. My sisters took her side, and my dad didn‚Äôt care. When I talked to him, he just said, ‚ÄúBut your mom is sick, you‚Äôre always messing with her, it‚Äôs your fault.‚Äù Even though I was just minding my own business in my room. When she got tired of me, she would send me to the psychiatric hospital. We kept going until we ended up back at the first psychiatrist, who told her that being ‚Äúsick of me‚Äù wasn‚Äôt a good enough reason to admit me to a hospital. She was also an alcoholic when I was a kid. Now you see what kind of mother she is. (My dad is no better.) They always hated me. When I say that to my close friends, they always tell me, ‚ÄúNooo, they don‚Äôt really hate you, they‚Äôre your parents.‚Äù But please believe me when I say they really do hate me for NO reason. I‚Äôve always been calm, introverted, and tried my best to please people. Now, here‚Äôs what just happened, and it scares me. First, you should know that I‚Äôm in student debt because they paid for my sister‚Äôs school but refused to pay for mine. I stopped talking to my mom for a week because she wanted me to organize her medication. I said okay. It took two hours. And at the end, instead of thanking me, she looked at me with disgust and said, ‚ÄúPff, I‚Äôm sure you hid Xanax in your pockets,‚Äù as if I were a drug addict. So I told her to apologize, or I would stop talking to her. She still didn‚Äôt. This afternoon, I was just making an apple pie in the kitchen. I thought people would be happy about it, lol. While I was doing it, she said stuff like, ‚ÄúPff, I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs doing it just to piss me off,‚Äù because usually, I‚Äôm not allowed to stay in the same room as her for too long, or she sees it as provocation. Then, she suddenly stormed into the kitchen, crying and yelling because I added more dishes to the sink (even though I was going to wash them). She completely lost it, screaming that I was ‚Äúdoing everything I could to ruin their lives,‚Äù that ‚Äúthey couldn‚Äôt stand me anymore,‚Äù etc. My apple pie needed ten more minutes in the oven, but she started shouting, ‚ÄúNO, I CAN‚ÄôT WAIT TEN MORE MINUTES WITH YOU HERE! LEAVE THE ROOM!!!‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt even talking, just washing the dishes. Then my dad told me I was making them crazy. I told him I was just minding my own business, and he said, ‚ÄúMaybe that‚Äôs the problem.‚Äù And he said to back up my bags and that by tomorrow I should not be in the house anymore Guys, whatever I do, they always have something to say. They just want me gone. He said they were going to kick me out. It reminded me of when my mom tried everything to send me to a hospital when I was too young to be kicked out. ‚∏ª Now, I know they really will kick me out. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I have 6‚Ç¨ in my bank account. I‚Äôm in debt, and my studies take a lot of time. I tried to find a weekend job because I knew my situation at home was unstable, but I couldn‚Äôt find one. I‚Äôm so scared. I also don‚Äôt have any friends that could help me. And I don‚Äôt have family because my mom fought with her entire family, so we haven‚Äôt spoken to them in years and years. What do you recommend I do? You might say I should work, and yes, I should probably keep looking for a job. But if I only work weekends, will I make enough to afford rent, food, and my 300‚Ç¨/month debt payments I'll have to start paying very soon? The big problem is that I‚Äôm in med school, and my studies will last for a long time. I think I‚Äôll get a (low) salary in my 6th year, but right now, I‚Äôm only in my 2nd year. (Side note: I haven‚Äôt had a proper meal in more than a week because they don‚Äôt make food for me and won‚Äôt let me cook. I‚Äôve just been eating garbage‚Äîcookies, snacks, whatever I can find. At school, I can‚Äôt eat lunch because I don‚Äôt have enough money in my bank account.) I‚Äôm lost and scared."

Social anxiety and other stuff was just so bad. I never got to party really never dated or went to dances. I thought college was supposed to be different! It wasn‚Äôt. I dropped out soon after joining. I just want to make something of my life but I feel like I never will. I see old posts from people I knew of in high school and it just hurts me.. they post about spending time with friends or dances. I even tried looking up ‚Äúmissed out on high school experience‚Äù here and everyone just said ‚Äúoh college will be better!‚Äù ‚ÄúYou going to college? It will help!‚Äù I just feel like a failure. I have nothing going for me. Counseling doesn‚Äôt even seem to help anymore and I feel more like a burden on my family. I don‚Äôt want to die but I also think I have no choice, like it‚Äôs the only right decision to make. I just get scared of it. I just wish I could redo my life and maybe then I could have a normal life. I have no friends, no job, and no goal in life. How can I go on when the only thing I am is a burden? How can I go on when there is nothing for me to live for. I‚Äôve already thought over how my family would react. They would be sad sure and it would be hard. But in the long run they wouldn‚Äôt have to deal with a worthless 19 year old anymore"

My girlfriend broke up with me a year ago because of anger management issues. She was nice and loved me too much, but she had her limits. Due to health problems, I lost my master's degree last year and remained ill till then. All of this resulted from my stupidity and inability to regulate my emotions. I'm 25, unemployed, ill, and devastated right now. I wake up every morning with a racing heart, never get a good night's sleep since last year, and I regret everything every single day. How should I proceed?"

I'm tired of not even being able to get out of bed most days. Of course I always end up getting out of bed, but not without a massive struggle to do so. I'm tired of being in constant mental distress. I've had anxiety my whole life, pretty much ruining most of my childhood and teen years. It got so bad at one point, I was basically in a perpetual, never ending anxiety attack for about two years straight. The anxiety improved, but depression got worse. And now I'm facing bad depression. I'm tired of everything being such a struggle. Just one thing right after the other. And it never stops. It's always *something.* I'm tired of feeling like I'm just dragging my rotting corpse wherever my brain thinks it needs to be. I'm tired of not feeling truly alive, but just merely existing. I'm tired of not really finding joy in most things. Of course, I enjoy my hobbies, but when I do I feel it's mostly half-hearted enjoyment at best. I hope you see why I'm tired."

    "text": "Im confused I doubt anyone would read all of this but if you want just skip to the bottoms maybe or just share how you are struggling hearing other people may help. I‚Äôm also not sure if what I‚Äôm facing is depression. I don‚Äôt know what I feel but my life is not the same barely any excitement but IK I‚Äôm not going to kill myself but I can‚Äôt explain it. My Weekdays are usually like: My mom waking me up but me just refusing till the last minute. Getting dressed quick not caring much about how I look and just sighing while looking at myself in the mirror. Quickly eating breakfast but I have many anger outburst in the morning uncontrolled I shout over small stuff. In the car it‚Äôs usually me not speaking because my parents and sister are angry I am almost making them late again and I shout sometimes again. School just drags on I barely have anyone to talk to or any time to do so as we have assigned seats and strict teachers but I do talk some classes but I feel like crying sometimes from loneliness. On my A day I usually have to eat lunch with my friend which is a whole another building so I have to walk all the way there but then I also have to see her say bye to my ex friend there who hurt me by leaving me with no explanation and it hurts seeing her with her but I just shrug it off. But for the past month or two I have been staying in my building to eat lunch alone away from her because I want to be alone idk why. Then on my B days I eat lunch alone and I find it peaceful but it hurts seeing other ppl eat lunch with friends I could sit with other people and talk to them but I don‚Äôt know I just can‚Äôt bring myself to do it because I feel like I can finally rest. I sometimes think back to last year when everything was good when I felt better but I did stupid stuff I regret back then to but I didn‚Äôt have this feeling and actually put in an effort for appearance and interactions with my friends didn‚Äôt feel so forced. I still think back cry and regret what I did I went on omgel slowly got groomed slowly finally gave in sent nudes which I still regret I feel disgusted with myself. I still remember a sleepover and me and my friends uploading a snap story and my friend getting a text and him just compliment me and that I‚Äôm pretty IDK all of this felt good as I was getting validation that I felt better about myself because my mom body shamed me IG. I also remember texting a guy at night he was my age and online I met him on my alt account and IG we texted every night for a few days before my mom caught me I got grounded and they took my phone away for a few days but I was ok I had my iPad. That guy was sweet but I stopped texting him and then my friends added me to this gc a bunch of bullying ig but not directed to me but I still defended stuff my dad saw it again and Ig that‚Äôs when I ended my stupid online stuff and actually for the first time cleared my phone and didn‚Äôt do stuff that needed to be secretive on it. I did more stuff online that might have hurt me but that was vague details ig but not to much I never showed my face and took measures but IG it somehow affected me. Then summer started I just stayed home and watched something all day on my screen and went out with my parents I was still ok but I did gain weight. I also lost the spark with my friends ig. Then the school year started though it would be the best but I was wrong and then on A days I used to sit with new people but had to leave to discuss with my friend because this friend left me and I lost those other people. And then everything just happened if felt like it repeated every day. I still wanted to look good tho and I went to school and procrastinated at home and did my work late slept late and then my health obviously isn‚Äôt going to be great and my mom would be worried and I know she cares for me but she has been diagnosed with depression so IG that makes it worse for her and me and everyone in the house. It‚Äôs just a lot of shouts and screams some days or should I say recently most of the days they are directed towards me and she swears calls me names and I try not to shout back cause if I do at that time it only ends with something idk what it is but she falls down screams cries and say I‚Äôm going to kill my self I don‚Äôt know but I barely cry infront of them and just look ig. This hurts I wish I can improve myself make my mom happy then none of this would happen my mom and my family would be much happier but my mom is suicidal and she asks me if she should leave if she should kill her self because I seemingly shout at her which I‚Äôm not proud of. What makes me feel guilt just a tiny but is when I go to my friends house and they open and omgele alt and somehow I end up being praised IK those me are sick but it gives me validation however I don‚Äôt do it on my own at home I know infront of my friends I wouldn‚Äôt be able to do something stupid. I constantly compare myself to friends and other I have so much in my life I should be happy I really should but I don‚Äôt which hurts I feel lower then everyone I just want to cry the whole day but I don‚Äôt. I even stay in the room during weekend pretending I‚Äôm doing work while I‚Äôm on my phone as I don‚Äôt know why but I just don‚Äôt want to spend time with anyone while the whole week I have done nothing but that. This also causes conflict my mom shouts at me which I just hate again. I feel like dying at that movement just for me to end up in hell from all the pain I caused others around me. Not even all of this matters my grandma she came here to see me but I could get myself to be of my phone as it‚Äôs my escape it drowns my memories away all the pain but why do I have it don‚Äôt I have a better life then the homeless. I didn‚Äôt talk much to her but she deserves my words but I didn‚Äôt I feel guilt cause she came here on a plane to see us but she left now. My other grandma however doesn‚Äôt care much about me Ik she somehow hurt my mom a lot cause my moms depression is caused by her and still fights between my parents would be caused by her or me but what hurts is she tell us to make a pancake for ourselves with the batter she left and she pretends she can‚Äôt operate to stove and called me every single time but for her daughters children she does a lot it evident she doesn‚Äôt like us much but still. Hell me even being born I made a mistake I was the last grandchild for her and I was to born girl rather then a boy like everyone wished for. Lastly I don‚Äôt know what made my life like this but today also makes me question things I used to love going out and going to restaurants but now today while my mom was waking me up I didn‚Äôt want to go it may not sound large but this has been happening for a few weeks it‚Äôs not normal for me all I wanted was to stay at home a read a story of another person a fictional character with a better life. I wonder what would have happened if we stayed back in that country 2 years ago instead of moving to USA where in that place I could have grown and also done better in basket ball and actually play it more but I know that if I were to stay there I would have made a mistake. I would have gotten myself a bf I would have been reckless because of the people around me I would have hid it from my parents but I can‚Äôt help but think that would have been better my parents would have been happier and I would have been popular still and I would have still been happy and all this is because we had to move because my sister wanted to study here. I actually was in the USA since I was born just moved there for a bit. I can‚Äôt talk to my sis she tell everything to my mom and I don‚Äôt want to ask anyone for academic help cause she makes me feel dumb. I know she is also just trying to help me but it hurts the way she talks. She makes me mad from just existing probably because I‚Äôm jealous? She is older than me to. What worries me is will I ever make an attempt to change my life what would motivate me to make a change when I feel it not so worth it. If you can answer these question I would feel happy: I‚Äôm just confused why do I want to not talk?Why do I not want to spend time with my friends why do I feel fake around them? Why do I have to have everyone hate me? Why am I letting my grades drop? Why am I letting life be bad when I can get it in control and make it better? Why do I feel it would be easier to end my life? But what is stopping me why am I not ending it? If anyone is reading this and read such a big rant thank you so much please leave a comment it may help and if you want to talk you could just DM me it‚Äôs better to struggle together then alone ig make motivate each other."

I thought overall I had issues but people still thought I was okay. But that isn't the case. I think I am a shitty, selfish human. Conversations and arguments with partners, acquaintances, and therapists have solidified this fact. I have OCD, depression, anxiety and anger issues stemming from my family and past trauma. I thought I could move past that stuff and finally be okay with my partner and life. But it won't and I think it is time I stop lying to myself. It won't matter how often I go to therapy, how much I work on the techniques, how much I write or the antidepressants I take, I won't ever be a good person.

I have been told I don't care about others, their emotions or their lives when a fight starts. I have been told I just hurt people and never take true responsibility for it or for changing. I have been told I close myself off and ruminate too much on everything. I have tried to get better. I go to therapy. I do the techniques given to me. I try to take care of my emotions so I dont have these moments. I find myself redirecting the small emotions way better than ever. But it doesn't matter. I keep failing still. I was so happy I had not caused any issues for an entire month until I couldn't let something mundane go. What sucks is that this isn't a cry for help or for attention or some type of self-flagellation. I don't need to be coddled or soothed or argued with. This is me finally accepting the unchanging part of me in the safest place I could find. I am a shitty, selfish, depressed, angry person."

I don't understand why I'm not getting replies. I'm getting some replies but still basically none. I've been left on read a few times by the group. It's just so fucking annoying. I wish I never fucking had periods because all of these fucking emotions are even more intense and I can barely deal with them sometimes! I'm laying here, I wanna try to sleep but I'll end up on my phone for ages, I know I will if not that I'll just be too busy thinking about all this fucking shit, making me feel worse and then end up going on my phone. Not only is people annoying me but so is the fucking temperature!!!!! It's like it's too hot but too cold at the same time and I'm sweating but it's also cold and I can't deal with it. I just want to fucking cry, not really because I'm sad, I don't think, I'm just so fucking tired and angry and annoyed and I just can't fucking deal with all of this shit right now. I just feel so fucking guilty, like a fucking burden on everyone around me, like all I'm doing is annoying them but for some reason I don't really feel that way with my family, its just mostly everyone else. Sure I feel like a bit of a burden on my family but not as much as others. I hate these fucking feelings. I wish I wasn't fucking me. Why do I always have to be so fucking annoying!?

But ever since finding out that my younger brother (21 M) struggles as well and wants to kill himself (and apparently attempted to last year), I feel like I'm drawing a blank about how to actually help him. I know the fact that he's seeking help is good. He's seeing a therapist weekly and started Prozac about a month ago. I go to the gym with him about 3 times a week and he seems happy then. But he still seems so bad overall. He barely showers and his moods fluctuate quite a bit. He feels like his friends don't actually like him. And there's a ton he doesn't tell me and I don't want to be an annoying, prying older sister. I've tried so many times to tell him I don't judge, I know what it's like to want to die, and I love him and just want him to be happy, but I know he's still embarrassed to open up. My mom really tries her best to talk to him, too. Every once in a while he'll open up but mostly he just gets annoyed. He's been sleeping most of the past 24 hours and I'm freaking out. I don't know what else to do, but there's no way I'm giving up. The thought of him killing himself makes me sick. Am I justified in feeling so scared? Is there more I could be doing? Or things I should be doing differently?"

I try to keep semblance of a normal life so people don't ask questions, not that there are many people to ask in the first place. I can't seem to find a job, or a job that I can keep, I have to sell off everything I own and will soon lose my vehicle. With no money it will be difficult to find travel to work if I do find some. With no energy it will be hard to make it to work and keep my job. But I don't really know what I'm even working toward if not just to keep the status quo... My family seems indifferent to me now, which I guess is movement in some direction. I have tried therapy multiple times, I've been on multiple medications to help level me out, but nothing works. I have crippling anxiety and depression that my family doesn't factor or believe I have. I'm stuck, there's no help, no opportunities, no one to turn to. I don't want to just exist and be a burden on people, and I don't see any steps forward, just a shovel down. thanks for letting me vent and for coming to my ted talk."

I don't want to view another philosophical view or some bs about nihilism. I have been dealing with a sudden Existential Crisis since last Thursday 3/13/25. This is honestly ironic as it was the day after my 15th birthday. I didn't have anything major life-changing like a breakup or whatever, but I was just suddenly questioning reality. I've had these questions like 'what is the point of life', or 'who is real', since I was very young, but I was always able to shake them off. But this time I got very invested and researched, and eventually it was to the point I was having a panic attack. I slept and the day after felt horrible. I had 0 interest in the present and just kept thinking about existence and meaning. However, over the week, I talked with GPT like a therapist (I can't afford one) and it has gotten better. I learned that what I was mostly feeling was derealization. I do feel better a week later, I don't question the abstract part as much but I'm feeling something else. This is what I wanted to ask: Although I wasn't as stressed as before about existence, I just feel empty- especially when I'm alone. I don't feel much motivation, and it feels like I'm looking out a glass window as life goes on. I hate this. I don't want to spend the rest of my life dealing with this. I wished I had never had that one thought. I normally had very strong emotions. I just almost feel depressed. I often get scared for it to turn dark because that is when I start getting anxious or depressed. If you guys had something similar, please share how you overcame it. Does it just come and go? And please, if you have something negative to say, I really don't want to think about it."

I had my first depression at the age of 9, following a violent argument between my parents in which my father threatened to kill me and my mother. I began to experience more and more harassment and rejection at the age of 11. At the age of 12, my mother went to hospital for over-medication. She came out of it without any after-effects, but afterwards my father often asked her to go to the pharmacy to get the same medicines for him. One day, I overheard a horrible telephone conversation between my mother and my half-sister. My mother was crying and told my sister that she suspected my father had pushed her to take more medication. Today, my life is hell, I'm filled with hatred and a horrible feeling of powerlessness in the face of all these injustices. All I do with my fucking life is walk alone in perfect solitude. No girl is interested in me, everyone I meet is cruel to me. The worst thing is this feeling that people see me as a failure and girls see me as a lousy pervert. I hate this fucking world!"

    "text": "Should I continue/find a new therapist? I went to therapy for a little more than a year. It did help me get perspective on the things I was struggling with, and I grew more and more confident and stable with how I handle myself during my depressive episodes. I saw how I could convince myself that setbacks happen but it doesn't mean you're not progressing, it doesn't mean you'll forever be depressed. I used to say this as a temporary spell to break me out of an episode, but after a while I really believed in it. I did things that I would have never done and it actually brought me joy. So I decided to stop and \"graduate\" from therapy 2 months ago (as my therapist said lol). I've had 2 meltdowns that lasted for 3-4 days since I stopped. The bigger one was the recent one where I got so anxious about deciding on my future career path that I got a panic attack and got stuck in an episode for 3 days. I know this is related to anxiety, but everytime this happens I revert back to how I lived when I was abroad and depressed alone. I cant eat much, cant bring myself to shower, I have to fake being able to talk to people and space out the whole day. I feel useless and unworthy, I wasted every day feeling guilty of being useless, and then I feel guilty for wasting time. I have zero confidence in myself, I've been living my life based on other people's opinions and advices and I've been through a lot of bad times when I made the decision. I dont have my own space to fully process all the emotions and thoughts, and I dont like asking/talking to my friends and family because i feel like they dont really understand what I'm going through (only one friend had depression but she was also the cause of mine so sometimes I don't feel comfortable talking about it with her) so the feelings got worse and made me think of su**ide. I'm feeling a little better now but I know that when I have an episode again, the same dread will arise and I just really hate how much it affects me. I'm not sure if it's necessary to continue seeing a therapist or do I just need to develop healthy coping mechanisms?"

I was supposed to go out with my sister and my mother today to a mall, but the stomach flu was acting up and I was stuck in the bathroom trying to rush myself so I could fully get ready. I don't know why I didn't just text them I wasn't feeling well, I think I was just focusing on the pain and also trying to go faster. They kept yelling at me from down stairs to hurry, I tried yelling back but they couldn't hear me. I think I just had my breaking point when I heard \"We aren't going anymore, you ruined it\". I just spiraled, I think it was a mix of coming from a funeral yesterday, the pain, and being stressed from the rushing and an exam I have later that I just started self harming. When they caught me it only just made it worse, my mother was screaming what was wrong with me and asking why, \"how do you think you doing this makes me feel\" I just felt even more miserable and awful. No one went to the mall, I am still upset and in pain and I don't know what to do. I think I ruined the day truly and I honestly don't want to do anything atm, I have lost all and any motivation and I am scared I might hurt myself again."

    "text": "How True Is It That Smoking Makes Depression Worse ? Been dealing with depression for like 8 yrs now and funny enough I started smoking around the same time I got diagnosed. For me, smoking‚Äôs always been an escape, just something to fill the void. At least it gives me that temporary chill, even if it‚Äôs all in my head. Can‚Äôt say the same for antidepressants tho. Those just slowed me down, made me gain weight, and honestly made shit worse. Since this depressive episode been dragging on for years, feels like my brain‚Äôs fried. My mind‚Äôs always foggy, memory‚Äôs trash, and sometimes even forming a sentence feels like a damn struggle. I know depression itself can do that, but could smoking be making it worse? I read somewhere that it messes with o2 flow to the brain, weakens neurons, and slows down thinking, but no clue if that‚Äôs real or just more bs theories. Tbh when it comes to mental health, I lost faith in docs and all that traditional treatment shit. My experience with antidepressants was a disaster, and at this point, I trust real ppl‚Äôs experiences way more than whatever new study they push every few months. So how true is it that smoking actually makes depression symptoms worse, like brain fog and focus issues? Cuz if that‚Äôs legit, I might need to rethink some things. My life‚Äôs already a mess thanks to this busted brain, and I just wanna fix whatever I still can. Maybe someone else can get something outta this too."

    "text": "Depression is making me really tired of people. I know you want to tell me that I should always keep a kind front on, no matter who it is, no matter what they've done to me, but I am losing the energy to have this constant smile on my face like im some fucking performance seal. I know you also want to tell me that I should seek professional help and get back to taking medication. But keeping up with appointments started to get really daunting for me and I don't see myself going back into it anytime soon. As for medication there are numerous reasons why i stopped taking it. 1. I cannot afford it. It gave me relief but then my parents stopped offering to pay for it for me, im only 19 so please dont give me a hard time on this. 2. i dont think medication will ever change my interpretation of others and it makes me irritated if it does change my views on other people. This is because I have grown this hatred over time for those who think i should be a certain way and took my true happiness. This applies to my friends, family and strangers who cant frind the most basic fucking human decency to give a little respect. But growing up in a selfish world isnt going to end well for me and I'll tell you that I don't see myself enduring through it. I'm NOT WEAK MINDED people get this upfront view of me that im overreactive. I'm also autistic so if you have it yourself or you've done research on it you'd realise this makes your emotions 100000000x fucking worse to put up with. ON TOP of society standards where I can't be seen any other way or i'll be miserably lonely forever. Never have I ever complained about solitude but it only started to bother me because others couldn't grasp the fact I LIKED BEING ALONE. But yeah I just have to keep taking it up the ass just like everybody else because thats the type of world we live in. We can't help eachother or ourselves, we put ourselves first and thats good but people cant seem to understand that they cant take this to extremes or everyone else suffers around them. But yeah, I'm just done with putting in any effort or being any use to anyone, so I guess people can just walk over me, i think i give up."

    "text": "i‚Äôm 15 and want to die this is my first post so sorry if it's all over the place! i'm 15 years old and have been struggling mentally for about a year and a half. it started freshman year when i started to skip school a lot, and i been a lot like at least once a week. i would skip school for many reasons like because i had sleeping problems. i'd had sleeping problems since 7th grade and could sleep without some kind of sleeping medicine. another reason i would skip is because i just simply didn't have the engergy. i didn't have the energy to get up in the morning then i didn't have enough to get up at all and i would bed rot for days. another reason is because i have a lot going on in my head i often think back into my childhood which wasn't good with my parents being split up and being abused in almost every way. i ended up failing algebra and had to take it again this year. which makes me feel stupid because i didn't fail because i'm dumb i failed because i never went to school and did my work. i'm also extremely shy and anxious so when i would go back to school and class that i missed a bunch of i would get worked up and have panic attacks. On top of that i only have like 3 friends maybe. i've never been social or good at making friends (i've been friends with all of them since i was a kid). at the beginning of second semester of freshman year i had to talk to a probation officer about my absences and was almost put on probation, but i kept missing school. even after being threatened with probation, cps, and juvie i continued to skip. I HATE SCHOOL AND ANYTHING ABOUT IT. when sophomore year started last fall it started good. i was somewhat happy with my classes and wasn't skipping a lot. my school has a rule that if you miss 4 or less days you don't have to take finals and every semester i strived to miss less the 4 days but of school that never happened until last fall i had miss 4 days so i could miss anymore and one day in november i skipped again. then it all started again i started skipping a lot again and my grades slipped and when school ended my mom signed me up for online school. i started doing online school in january but never really did it (idk why i just couldn't). and eventually i was kicked out of online and for the past month i haven't gone to school at all and i've just been laying in my room feeling depressed. i've fucked myself for life with what i've done to myself. i'll probably never be able to come back from this academically or mentally and honestly feel like there no reason for me to go on. if i can't even go to school or do my work then i'll never be able to have a job or work. my whole life i've felt like somethings wrong with me. when i was little my dad loved my stepmom or than me i felt unlovable and developed self esteem issues at a very young age. i've always felt ugly and boys never have really showed interest in me, rather people around me. i also feel dumb from failing classes but because all my friends are very smart (my best friend is top of the class) so i have always felt pressured. also i have 2 cousin that are in my grade who do really well academically and athletically so my grandma i live with is always comparing me to them. i used to be so happy and do well in school and i even played sports. i played softball for 8 years but eventually my mental health got in the way of that as well. mental illnesses run in my family and so does addiction so i've been doomed since before i was born. i've suspected that im mentally ill for a while (since i've always felt like something's wrong with me) and i think i might have depression. i sit in my room all day by myself, because that's the only way i'm happy. i'm only happy when i'm alone or so that's what i thought but i'm starting to think that's just what i'm used to and i've just adapted to that feeling and think its happiness. (i hope that makes sense). But truly the only way i'm happy is when i'm high and i'm not trying to sound like a pothead, but i've been smoking since i was 13 so it's became a coping mechanism i guess. also weed is the only thing that helps me sleep so when i did go to school i would have to get violently hugh ever night just to be able to sleep. i tried to start self harming when i was 12 but could never bring myself to cut myself, making me feel like a pussy. when i was 14 is when i actually started self harming. i would burn myself with cigarettes and still do it to this day. almost 2 years later and nobody has ever noticed. NOT A SINGLE SOUL HAS NOTICED SCARS OF MY ARMS AND LEGS. i'm starting to think i should burn myself in more noticeable places so people will notice and actually believe that i'm struggling and not a lazy failure. a call of help i guess but i don't want to seem like an attention seeker. and i think i might be starting to get addicted to it because i like the way it feels and the scars. since i've been out of school in december i've started eating less because i don't eat lunch at school anymore. i don't eat breakfast or lunch and hardly ever eat dinner. i usually just eat a snack once or twice a day or sometimes nothing at all. i've actually lost over 10 pounds because of this and i weight about 80 something pounds now and the bmi says i'm underweight. like i said earlier i struggle with self esteem issues so i don't like that way i look. i've been extremely skinny my whole life and was often praised for it as a kid, so now it's nailed in my head i have to been skinny and petite. when i was a little kid i was short, skinny, blonde, blue eyed, and had a perfect smile thanks to my fake teeth. i'm starting to think i might be anorexic or am developing it because on top of loosing that weight i have also lost my appetite and often have to force myself to eat. my period have became irregular and almost didn't have one last month, which i know happens when someone is anorexic. i spend a lot of time in the mirror looking at myself, and i hate how i look. thin lips, dead dyed hair, dark circles, bad skin, crooked teeth, everything. i also spend alot of time looking at my body. i hate how flat i am but also love being skinny. i know this isn't nice but i'm scared to become fat and often see myself bigger then i am. i only feel skinny when i can see my ribs poking through my skin, but i hate how skinny my legs and arms are. i find myself caking on tons of makeup just to feel a bit pretty. i hate my smile because my teeth are crooked. as i little kid i had to get caps on my real teeth because they were rotting or something. my teeth were perfectly straight and SO WHITE, but now are just crooked and yellowish. i haven't been to the dentist in 8 or 9 years and i have cavities i think. when i was a kid my dad enjoyed pulling my teeth out for some weird reason so as i got older i stopped talking about my teeth period with anyone and i didn't even touch my loose teeth. i would let them fall out on their of or wait for the new tooth the grow above it, creating crowding with my teeth. now i'm almost 16 and haven't even lost all my teeth yet. i've tried talking to people but nobody understands me. i've never met anyone who's gone through the same things as me. none of friends growing up and now didn't have split parents, none of them were abused, or lived in a dysfunctional household. not even my parents or siblings understand cause they didn't go through it. anytime i try and talk about how i'm feeling to my mom or grandma they just bring up school and remind me that i'm a failure. i've been asking to go to the doctor for over a year and they say they'll take me but they never do, no matter how much i've cried,begged, and pleaded...literally. i have broke down in tear multiple times just begging for help and nobody does anything. Nobody has really ever asked me what's wrong or something like that. not friends. not teachers. not even my family. i feel so lost and different from everyone else and i just want help. im actually starting to blame my mom for that way i am. because if she just took me to the doctors like she promised i probably wouldn't be writing this right now. i don't know what to do anymore help or a doctor is not and option anymore and i can't talk to anyone. i tried to kill myself last year but absolutely it didn't work and i've been contemplating suicide again for a while now. i'm never gonna be anything or do anything in life so i feel like there's no point. everyday i live just feels like a chore at this point and i'm tired of vacuuming the same spot everyday if you know what i mean. so i guess i'm coming to reddit or help or answers. if you have questions i'd be happy to answer them. i honestly have no idea what to do with myself."

The issue is that I am often depressed because of this and my appetite goes away and my desire to work out as well. I don't even know why I am that skinny.

It's been hard trying to move forward with my life because every time I try to gain a sense of normalcy, something always shatters it. It's been like this for the past 5 years, on and off intense trauma. As you can see from the posts I've made on this account, the big trauma currently is dealing with my mom's cancer. I keep being told to learn to cope, that things will get better, be positive, read the bible, etc. When I talk to my family about it, I don't think they truly understand how it feels to have your young adult life being completely uprooted by traumatic events in such a short period of time. My brothers like to give pep talks when I vent, but they're 7 years older than me. When they were my age, the world was different. Things were still a mess, but a tolerable one. Sometimes I wish I was born a few years earlier so I could be old enough to deal with how the world is now. I'm struggling with what I want to do career wise and where I want to go in life. It's funny how when I started college, I was given this talk of how I'm young and have so much time to figure myself out. But now that I'm out I'm expected to hurry that up and know myself now. Feels like no matter what I do or who I talk to, no one's been able to help. It's frustrating."

I know what I have to do, but I'm simply unable to be myself. My brain just can't be normal around others and it saddens me. There are days where I can connect freely with others, but most of the time I just act zombie-like and come off as uninterested. I currently work a very boring, bureaucratic government job but I'm studying for what is equivalent to the SATs in my country to try to get into medicine. If I am unable to make any significant impact on the life of others through my personality, then maybe I can get into a field where I can do that through other means. This, in my eyes, would be a way to save myself from a miserable, unimpactful middle age... I like people. I like living. And I try my best every day. But I just wish it was easier for me. I go to therapy and it makes me feel better, but it can't fundamentally change who I've always been. I'm lost."

    "text": "I can already tell my next session with my therapist is going to really stress him out. The poor guy has been having trouble keeping up with me because my original therapist, who was great with me, passed away suddenly and I walked in with a lot. I was in the middle of going through a lot of psychological changes with the first therapist and all of a sudden this guy had to be thrust into it. To his credit, he has kept his cool so far even though I didn't trust him at first. My psychiatrist says I'm improving but the only role a psychiatrist really plays is medicine management so it's all a matter of are the meds working or not. Thankfully they are which is why I'm only posting and talking about it and often instead of acting out impulsively and destroying things like I used to in high school. I think one of my main problems right now is that I'm readjusting to being completely sober instead of just California sober. The pain I've been going through is just searing hot, unlike My peers who can go out and have a drink or smoke a joint and turn those feelings off, I don't get that luxury. Whatever I feel stays there until it's over and I don't see an end in sight. Sometimes it feels like I want to die. I don't want to die but I have grown tired of this weight on my heart. The constant worrying if someone is okay. I've been met with a lot of criticism for speaking out and being honest and I'm honestly to the point where I don't care and I get combative because this is what I was trying to do. I was trained to talk It out. There's just one big problem though. I don't trust the immediate people around me because of all the criticism I've gotten so I've been posting on Reddit about it. I know it's sad but in between therapy, this is the only place I feel safe. If somebody says something I don't like I can just block them and I never have to hear it again. I don't mean to be an inconvenience to anybody but at some point I had to put at least a little bit of my training from therapy into action or else what was the point? I don't know. Sometimes I feel like I'm just a burden on everybody and maybe I would be better off dead but I can't do that to my family so I suffer. I don't feel like anybody understands me. My therapist barely understands me as hard as he tries. I'm not a very religious guy but I've even taken to praying at the cemetery and it's one of the few times I actually do get a little bit of peace in my troubled mind. Something about the quiet air and being able to look up at the stars next to my dad's grave is somehow soothing. I guess the best way I can put this is that I am okay but I'm not okay. I don't know if I'm spiraling or falling with style. The only thing I do know is that I didn't slip, I jumped."

I came to the US for my master's with a goal to study and finally get a job while also experiencing a new life. It's been 3.5 years since I have been here and I haven't been able to do any of that. I completed my master's but couldn't land an internship or a job. I was basically alone during my master's, couldn't make any friends. All I could do is see people around me enjoying their lives, finding jobs, travelling, falling in love and overall having a good time, and I ended up short of all those things after trying so hard. I genuinely did. Now all the people that I knew around me have moved away from me and I don't really have anyone to talk to and I still stuck here trying to find a job, no money, make friends and get better. I had a couple of \"friends\" from my home country but no one really messages me or talks to me unless I reach out and that feels really shitty. I see everyone moving ahead in life and making something for themselves and then see myself still stuck where I was before it all began and I feel like I am reaching my breaking point now. I have been constantly contemplating about ending things and I can't just get that out of my head..

Other people find a partner that treats them well, again not my case. I have no one to talk to, I'm in therapy but she's so cold and never says anything helpful. Just tells me a stupid breathing technique while I'm tears at the end of session, because \"we're out of time\". I feel really lost. Like why was I ever placed here? To be the world's punching bag?

I‚Äôm overwhelmed with the idea of going out and also disappointing my husband more than I already do. I don‚Äôt know if I can carry a conversation with him right now. When he talked to me earlier I just stared at a random box and read the label over and over while trying to respond the best I could. I‚Äôm trying but at what cost? I hate feeling this way. I just want to be normal or disappear."

It is such a relief. Is this what life is supposed to feel like?? And why did it just snap change like that? Did I heal without noticing the build up??"

I struggle with anxiety and depression, and today was a particularly bad day. I need to tell someone this. I had an important exam today.Then there were classes at college, I returned home only at 8 pm. All this in a heap with the second day of my period. Honestly, I'm just terribly tired, both mentally and physically, but what hit me harder was that my family started arguing before I even got home. I really wanted someone's support, care, attention or something like that. But in the end, my mother's bad mood just spilled over into endless irritation with me.None of my loved ones paid attention to me today. These are all small things, but I really wanted care from at least someone today. And no one found time for me I cried very bitterly, I suppose it's because of my period, hormones and depression, but still. I feel very bad now.."

    "text": "Looking for explanation to what is that I happening to me Not sure if this subreddit is the place to ask this but I am looking for explanation to what is this: I feel like I find it hard to stay alive. I don‚Äôt mean in a way of feeling suicidal. I don‚Äôt feel suicidal. I am talking about my body here, I basically feel like I am spending all energy on keeping my body alive. I feel like all I do is work hard to keep my body alive. I am not even talking about chores; eating drinking, moving etc. I am talking about sensations inside my body, I feel like I am aware of it all that goes inside my body, how it operates, and basically I feel like I am responsible on keeping it going, keeping it working. As if because of this awareness now, (my awareness so me, my mind), I am now responsible to stay awake in terms of my awareness to keep my body working so I can stay alive. Does that make sense? Its really difficult to explain it‚Ä¶. And so now my questions are: - Is this some weird suicidal thought? - Or am I sensing my own death? - Orr I am just going insane? - Orrr maybe I reached some fucked up high level of enlightenment state? ü§£"

Changed my major. My top choice school received my FAFSA, im eligible for the maximum aid. Only received 12k more. It's an out of state school and will still have to pay back 100k in loans if i decide to attend. They gave a substantial scholarship, but not enough to allow me to afford to attend. Other schools haven't even updated with my aid, so idk if it will be the same outcome. I want to see my long distance bf this summer. Was going to DoorDash to afford it. DoorDash is 19+ in my state. Applied for a bunch of places (over many months, but especially this week). Have heard back from none of them. On top of that, struggling with relapse of my eating disorder and horrible self image. Nobody even responds to me in this sub anymore, on either of my accounts. Whenever I talk to friends and my bf about my problems, they listen for a second and never follow up with me. nobody cares enough and i don't either. it's so frustrating and tiring. i don't even have the guts to kill myself because i'm so existential about life after death. can only hope that it'll be done for me. though, i don't have the guts to fully want that either. i'm worthless and a coward in every aspect. i'll probably be homeless or a prostitute one day, it's all im good for."

    "text": "I‚Äôm becoming depressed and stressed everyday because of ex online friends because of online friends, my life almost got ruined. during my elementary and middle school life, i got bullied. I‚Äôve always had online friends during this time but it wasn‚Äôt that bad (until 2020 but some of the parts in here are relevant to this story) so it was maybe December 2023 and I lost my last friends in my school(I went to a small school so the only ones left were the popular kids who bullied me) I was 13 during this time and I made some close online girl friends and one guy friend. then during February 2024, those friends didn‚Äôt really contact me as much and I was getting bored since a new girl came to my class during January but then suddenly stopped being my friend. so anyways, I use to play Fortnite but i didn‚Äôt really like the game but heard you can find friends there so I decided to do that. I made a new account(forever thankful for) and started asking people in comment sections to add. since I was obviously a girl I thought only girls would wanna play with me but nope.. so anyways, some guys dmed me and I was a little skeptical. the first guy I‚Äôll call him mark. mark was kinda weird, like I tried to get to know him better as a friend but he was kinda dismissive and was..strange. basically, while we played I chatted to him and asked questions like, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs ur favourite animal?‚Äù he said dog and I said cat. but then I asked him ‚Äúdo you wanna ask me a question‚Äù and he was like ‚Äúidk‚Äù (his favourite word) so then his friend came to play with us. after that game he told me that his friend said me and mark were good together(only knew the guy for like 2 days) later on, the guy kept ignoring me and I was getting confused. I didn‚Äôt wanna be friends with someone who wasted my time. I decided to confront him with the help of another guy(James who is the chillest guy) and to wonder why he kept ignoring me. Now btw James wasn‚Äôt that into the convo and I was talking to him in another chat but later he left since it was to much for him. al of a sudden mark just said he wants to be with me and I was so scared of saying no since he was low-key guilt tripping me. I decided to say yes even tho I had no feelings and didn‚Äôt even know who the guy was. the relationship was weird as he seemed he just wanted to ruin my life? anyways during this time I went back to my old friend group from December(Kay, Mia, nana and Joan) and they were really invested in this. they kept telling me to act up more around mark since they thought he was funny. I faked saying I was depressed and stuff to make mark break up with me since I told my December friend group I hated mark. later on, another guy dmed me and asked to play. we did and eventually that was it. I‚Äôm gonna call him Donald as this guy was so weird. so after we played we stopped talking until basically, Kay told me to find another guy to ‚Äúdate‚Äù but I didn‚Äôt tell them I wasn‚Äôt into online dating. she said give it a try because she already had an online boyfriend. anyways, i decided to share videos to guys in my dms to try and ‚Äútalk‚Äù to them but I just sent them weird videos which that part I didn‚Äôt tell Kay. anyways later on me and Donald started talking again and I thought he was actually cool and hoped I could befriend him. but nope he had a crush on me and it was obvious. so basically while I talked to him, I was bored and decided to vc him. he seemed he didn‚Äôt care and sounded like a child lmao. anyways my December friend group was listening into the call with another device as everything was good. I also made friends with another guy called Dj who I didn‚Äôt care about but accidentally treated him like a therapist(this part is importent) because I was going insane. boys were liking me and mark btw kept asking me to show my face and it was so annoying. I felt disgusted but my friends in December just thought it was funny to trick 12-14 year old boys. (they were like 15/16-18) anyways, a weird conversation with Donald made me hate him and basically. So this part made me think like ‚Äúoh he‚Äôs a nice guy‚Äù because he told me his sister got her period recently and he felt scared and bad because she was in a lot of pain. I decided to be nice and say some stuff and he accepted it. it was until this part which I made sure to fake argue with guy friends to let them know I see them as a brother. so basically, he randomly called me ‚Äúflat‚Äù and I was so confused so I said like ‚Äúoh how do you know‚Äù no idea why I said that but then he said this ‚Äúbecause my sister has bigger ones then you‚Äù I was shocked and disgusted and I asked him like ‚Äúwdym‚Äù he then said like his sister was like c cup(she‚Äôs 11) and I was like ‚Äúoh‚Äù and he said that his sister will have a Z cup when shes 18. that made me hate him because why would you say that about your sister? days went on and suddenly Mark was being a a hole to me. he kept being bipolar or something by saying stuff like ‚Äúoh I hate you‚Äù and kept ignoring me. then suddenly when we were arguing, he sent a pic of a random girl. I was shocked and I found out he could be cheating(even tho I won‚Äôt call that as a relationship) so anyways I told Donald about this as he said like ‚Äúoh don‚Äôt worry I‚Äôll roast him‚Äù and I was like um ok. he went into my following as followed mark. they talked and stuff and I told the December friend group about this. they said Donald was being annoying(since I also told them about the sister thing) and that I shouldn‚Äôt have told him that stuff. anyway. me and mark broke up(I‚Äôll like to mention me and mark fought every two days and broke up then went back together 12 times) so I was relieved I was finally ‚Äúsingle‚Äù and no other boys will annoy me‚Ä¶ so it was my 14th birthday and I was having an actual good day being offline and not always talking to them. I started thinking that I should just lose my online friends and actually talk to people so I decided to tell all my friends that but decided to do that on Donald since I didn‚Äôt care about him. so suddenly I was suspicious a lot because days before my birthday, my December friend group was debating if Donald liked me or not and Joan told me to say this to me if I get a chance. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll hop on that instead‚Äù I didn‚Äôt want to and I thought it was gross but he insisted. anyways I said that and it started becoming sexual as my December friend group was having such a fun time making fun of him and giving me cringey lines to use. I was laughing honestly because I thought it was so gross. now cut to my birthday and nana said to confront Donald since she was the one I trusted out of the December friend group and seemed more.. mature? anyways I told her I didn‚Äôt want online friends anymore and wanted to talk to my ex friends again as she told me just to ask Donald like ‚Äúwhat are we?‚Äù and if he says friends that I should just tell him to leave and if he said dating that I should say I didn‚Äôt want that and I‚Äôm leaving anyway. so that was the plan, I asked him and he was lik ‚Äúwhat do you wanna be‚Äù I told nana in a call privately but Joan came in randomly and dared me to say ‚Äúdating‚Äù I didn‚Äôt want to and nana said to just leave it but I said it anyway. suddenly now I‚Äôm dating a boy I didn‚Äôt even like. few days go by and my December friends didn‚Äôt really like Donald as he was so cringe. which was true. so we started scouting for new boys for me but I didn‚Äôt want any. during this Donald asked me weird question overtime and kept making weird jokes which I hated but played along. I didn‚Äôt wanna make this kid sad tbh. anyway first Donald told me a weird dare that I should put my elbows together on my chest in front of everyone to prove I‚Äôm not ‚Äúflat‚Äù(he loved calling me that). I was weirded out. anyways we met another kid who is the one in most scared of called Jacob. so I started talking to him and I wish I never did because he became sexual to me right away and kept saying stuff about myself. I was so weirded out and wanted to die. I couldn‚Äôt take this anymore as i remember that Donald use to send voice recordings to me and I use to record them with another app and sent them to my December friends to make fun of him. of course Donald was so weird and I hated him but he didn‚Äôt deserve to be made fun of. I decided how could I make everyone leave me alone for once? I remembered in 2020 where I did something extreme and ‚Äúfaked my death‚Äù and becoming sucidal. I couldn‚Äôt take these online friends anymore as they were making me feel so negative. so I decided to send a ‚Äúsuicide‚Äù note to everyone saying I was gonna kill myself. that was terrible and back fired as Donald suddenly texted all my mutuals that I didn‚Äôt talk to that I ‚Äúkilled‚Äù myself. I was so mad because then Donald and Jacob met(worst thing ever) as they also knew where I live and Donald knew my city. I was so done and it was so annoying getting spammed that I shouldn‚Äôt die. I didn‚Äôt actually want to die but I wanted to get away from everyone. so then I came back and they were relieved. well only Donald and Jacob and Dj since everyone else didn‚Äôt rlly care and was like ‚Äúoh damn‚Äù so as I came back I had a new mission. make everyone hate me. my December friends group for some reason I wanted to keep at that time and decided to tell them what happened as they laughed at me for being dramatic and told me if I want them to hate me then I have to act like an incel. I already acted like that before but I felt it was too much. anyways during this time Donald made more weird jokes about his sister. basically we were talking about how me and Jacob don‚Äôt gain weight and Donald said he did. anyways he then said he wished he was his sister because she gained weight ‚Äúin the right places‚Äù me and Jacob, it felt like we actually looked at eachother and at him as Donald kept saying she had a nice butt and boobs. it was so weird and I recorded it all and showed it to the December friend group as they had a blast. so anyways, during this I‚Äôll like to say Jacob had a crush on me and I didn‚Äôt tell Donald. I thought that maybe this could make me untrustworthy and Donald would leave me alone. so nothing happened sadly anyways Jacob and Donald fought a lot and I just wanted to leave. I‚Äôm gonna say that I missed actually talking to my real classmates and during this time I just ignored them and acts mean and emo to them. we had alot of beef between as and this was my last school year with them and I wished we could‚Äôve all sorted this out. then there was a time where Kay dared me to send ‚Äúnoods‚Äù to Donald. I didn‚Äôt want to and she said that she will edit it and to make sure it won‚Äôt actually show anything and they wont find me. honestly I was actually flat so I actually sent Kay a real photo of my chest with a bra and she edited it and told me to send it to Donald. I was scared and regretted this immediately. I sent it and now, Donald had a photo of my chest. Since Jacob liked me I sent a photo to which I didn‚Äôt even think about. anyways then I met a new guy named Connor and I decided that I can finally leave Donald and Jacob because Connor liked me and even tho I didn‚Äôt, maybe I could‚Ä¶cheat? the thing is my online group from 2020 hated me because I was a cheater and never talked to me again. not sure if they are still friends or smth but I did tried talking to them again under a fake name but obviously I just thought ‚Äúmaybe it‚Äôs for the better‚Äù and left. I decided maybe I can make them hate me and they would leave me like how everyone else does. I decided to have some thing with Connor as a side relationship and I saw from Mia‚Äôs relationship which she showed us that once her boyfriend found a new guy, he immediately ghosted her, ignored her and was being dismissive towards her: I tried that and it was working until they confront me. for some reason I mention I was talking to Connor and then Donald went ahead and dmed him. they started talking and out of nowhere and Jacob kept saying stuff racist stuff. during this time irl, I caught feelings again for my classmate who I really liked for a while and since this day everyone was busy. I realized how much fun I was having without online friends and how being outside was actually fun.. so I decided to have some time for myself and make one of my friends pretend to be me. for me being dismissive and rude I was really bad at it so I gave Joan all my socials account passwords. if it was messages I just copy pasted what he sent me to say to them. during this time, I met a girl and she was pretty cool. she was new to this school and when I talked to her we liked the same stuff like Taylor swift, Roblox and kdramas. I liked talking to her and it was so fun taking troll pictures of our classmate who she had a crush on for sure. stuff was going great until Joan had to leave and I had to talk. a small recap was givin to me as I decided to talk to those guys again. I was honestly done with this cycle and just wanted to talk to my real friends. as we were talking, I also gave Donald a few days back my social account passwords and since he noticed I was being more meaner, he looked though my messages(fyi, this entire time I had a burner account to talk to Donald,Jacob,Connor etc so nobody knows about the December friend group) anyways Donald saw my messages and I only had nana and Mia with me. I was a little scared but nana said this could be my time to leave those guys. basically I told them I didn‚Äôt want anything to do with them and I‚Äôm breaking up and I never wanna talk to them again. I decided to block them and it was fine until. overtime Jacob kept making alt accounts to text me aswell as Dj (as I stopped being friends with him too) and Donald. then Connor was scared and found out that Donald knew it this was just so messy. I‚Äôm a little thankful for nana and Mia for helping me deescalate this situation. anyways it was the last days of school and I started ignoring everyone even Connor who also kept begging me for a face reveal. it was a week before grad and I had a fun time with my class and I decided to block everyone and I mean everyone and start new. but Jacob found me again and this is what was making me scared this whole time he told me that he was gonna expose me and leak my ‚Äúnoods‚Äù even tho they were fake, I was so scared and I didn‚Äôt want anybody finding out as btw, since they have my phone number, my class tiktok account leaked and Jacob messaged my classmates. I‚Äôm just so scared my classmates might find out about this and I hope they haven‚Äôt.Anyways I had the last day with my class and everyday I wish I can go back and actually make an apology to my classmates because we were all in the wrong but nope. my entire time was taken up by online friends. during these few months, Mia,Joan,nana and Kay were a little mad and Kay kinda threaten my with the chest pic but she didn‚Äôt know about my classmates and when I told them all I was done. they were mad and said they didn‚Äôt care. but nana messaged me privately and told me good luck and not to worry because it‚Äôs not like Jacob will fly out to my country and do stuff. I just hope they would leave me alone.even tho they did threaten me and also Jacob did see my face by mistake on call since he always wanted to call me. I was just scared but then I got over it. until now when someone messaged me and I got ptsd and flashbacks. I also had a dream that Jacob leaked everything and I was the laughingstock of tiktok. It was just weird because I thought I forgot about them. anyways I‚Äôm so glad I let this out and to anybody reading this, please reassure me or tell me something and what you thought. it‚Äôs so long but I hope you guys can help me. (I‚Äôll like to mention Jacob and Donald and Connor were racist aswell as Kay and mark, they are homophobic, transphobic etc and always said every slur in the book, I also only talked to them becaue I was bored and I thought(okay it shouldn‚Äôt be that bad they would leave me right? like how everyone else does and it‚Äôs just until the summer break. it was only because nobody talked to me during school and I was bored so I needed a friend.) thank you for listening and lmk if I was in the wrong or if this is just something for me to laugh at years later."

    "text": "Family trauma affects me everyday I‚Äôve been kinda realizing how much my childhood and some major life events shaped me. I won‚Äôt go into the specifics, but from being constantly criticized growing up, to losing my dad in my life, and two of my sisters due to reasons I had no control over, I‚Äôve developed one hell of an abandonment wound. It‚Äôs crazy. Two years ago I was homeschooled and had no friends and felt so hopeless. Now I‚Äôm at college, with an amazing girlfriend and friends who I all life very much, and that feeling of hopelessness hasn‚Äôt completely gone away. I‚Äôm home for spring break right now, and I notice that‚Äôs when most of my negative emotions come up. I love my family so much. We‚Äôve all been through so much together but I just feel like they sometimes don‚Äôt understand me, or really appreciate who I am as a person. I know they care about me a lot, but I feel like my friends value my presence a lot more. Idk I just feel a lot of bad emotions. Low self esteem, so exhausted, a little angry and I don‚Äôt know why. I just wish I was secure in myself. I‚Äôm so not. I overthink everything with relationships, especially with my girlfriend. I choose not to let my past trauma define me or give me excuses to be a dipshit brother, boyfriend, etc. That‚Äôs what my twin sister chose to do. Even tho she‚Äôs kind of a terrible person I really miss her. I just feel like I‚Äôm trying so hard everyday to conquer my negative self, and I just wish I heard someone tell me how strong I was. Even tho I really don‚Äôt feel like I am. I just don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with me. Life is really good right now. School is stressful, but I just can‚Äôt handle life‚Äôs overwhelm as well as everyone else it seems. It‚Äôs like there‚Äôs this logical part of me that knows who I want to be‚Äî confident, assertive but kind, just a good person. And then there‚Äôs this instinctual part that‚Äôs trying to take the wheel‚Äî angry, hurt, sensitive, and that‚Äôs my first reaction in most situations."

It has helped certain areas of my life, and I know in order to really ‚Äúheal‚Äù I have to change my mindset, but I‚Äôve tried that. I‚Äôve tried smiling more and caring less about stupid things. I travel, pass most of college classes, hang out with friends, and currently have good relationships with my family. But I‚Äôm tired, and not a burnt-out tired. It‚Äôs an indescribable type of exhaustion. I think of suicide everyday, even when my day is going fine. One of my biggest fears is being seen as attention seeking, and I know my friends and family don‚Äôt understand because of comments they have made in the past. And when people say, ‚Äúwe all die in the end, so why not live,‚Äù I think ‚Äúwe all die so why does it matter if I die a little sooner‚Äù is just as valid to say. Are some people just mean to kill themselves? I feel like that‚Äôs my only ending."

When I did the \"Online Questionnaire\" with the questions of how I was feeling (over the past week) , I lied and said I was fine. When she called and asked how I was feeling I again said fine. I'm NOT fine !! For the most part , I've been depressed. Mind you....not depressed enough to be locked up , but still depressed. I live in a State that the Shrinks LOVE to flaunt how they can have someone locked up if THEY feel it's necessary. I'm not in a place mentally that needs visit number 10 to the hospital. I'm just not happy , border line miserable. Now for the AH part..... Have a female friend (btw I'm male) that I'm going to be giving a ride to a hospital for minor surgery . For some strange reason she has a \"Thing\" for me but I'm just not interested. I'm not leading her on in any way shape or form. I'm very cautious with what I say to her. I don't use the word \"Love\" with her at all . I feel bad about this too . I'm going to try to have a discussion with her over this when I see her. All I want is friendship."

Somehow, I‚Äôve managed to hold it together‚Äîpushed through, masked it well enough to build what looks like a ‚Äúperfect‚Äù life. Got the wife, the nice house, the cars, multiple trips a year all over the world. Money‚Äôs not a problem. On paper, I‚Äôve got it made. But inside, I‚Äôm just‚Ä¶ fucking empty. The last few years have shredded whatever grip I had on keeping up the act, and I feel like I‚Äôm hitting my breaking point. Two years ago, my dad‚Äîthe only parent I‚Äôve had since I was 14‚Äîdied out of nowhere. It blindsided me. Prior to that, less than a year of my dad dying both my grandparents (his parents) passed too. All three family members I had left gone in a year. It‚Äôs like my whole foundation got ripped out from under me. On top of that, my wife and I have been battling infertility for 3 years‚Äîcountless treatments, hundreds of thousands of dollars, mostly covered by my job‚Äôs insurance. Speaking of work, it‚Äôs a soul-crushing mundane existence. I hate it. It‚Äôs unfulfilling, my coworkers and I don‚Äôt mesh. But I can‚Äôt leave‚Äîthe insurance is why we can even keep fighting the infertility battle. So I‚Äôm trapped. Lately, my wife and I are barely on the same page. We‚Äôre fighting constantly, disconnected as hell, and I feel like she‚Äôs more of a roommate‚Äîor worse, a parent‚Äîthan a partner. I‚Äôm so alone in all this. The sadness and numbness are swallowing everything. Normally, I can mask it‚Äîsmile, crack a joke, keep it moving. But I‚Äôm slipping. I‚Äôm getting sloppy, dropping balls I‚Äôd usually juggle without blinking. I don‚Äôt care about shit I used to‚Äîlike the house, the trips, the image. It‚Äôs all hollow. I don‚Äôt know how to keep pretending. I‚Äôve got everything I‚Äôm ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù to want, but I‚Äôm drowning. Normally I can recognize it and tidy it up enough to hide it. But this time? I don‚Äôt really fucking care to."

I drive myself into these constant cycles of self destruction where I feel I have no power anymore. I‚Äôm alone and everyone I try to talk to about it either calls me crazy (my parents) or tells me to not think so negatively. I wish I could but that‚Äôs my issue.

All my interests feel like a waste of time and I spend most of my day in bed just waiting for a miracle to happen. Even when people are concerned about me or ask me to meet up I feel even worse. Old friends who are grown up and have careers, wives, a house and I have nothing. Family who want to help but don‚Äôt understand what I am going through.

We are always having issues, stupid insignificant arguments that wont matter but today I just feel defeated. I've been so depressed lately that I can't bring myself to clean dishes so they're piling up, nobody else lifts a finger to help me even though they make majority of the mess so it falls to me. I know it needs to be done and it's a health hazard. I just want it to end already. We got into a big ass argument about how depression isn't real, it's just a mindset, that I need to just get off my fat ass and finish cleaning the house even though I also work a full-time job and I pay for groceries and anything else. I'm also paying for wedding stuff. My partner doesn't get it, I know I need to do the dishes and he always starts arguments right when I get to work so I can't do shit about it from here. It makes me feel like driving into a fucking wall. I've been struggling with depression for years and years and I'm on Lexapro but it doesn't help and I feel like I just want to run away and don't come back. I love my partner but he feels like since he is Mexican, that depression does not exist and people in Mexico don't believe in that shit. he said the same thing about my disability, that it's just made up (I have arthritis and a spinal deformity as well as a heart defect.) and that it's just an excuse to be lazy. I don't know how I can keep going on. I don't have a suicide plan or anything but sometimes I hope something takes me out so I don't have to deal with everything anymore. I love my partner and I do want to be married to him but sometimes I feel like he will never understand until I break something or I die."

The hardest thing about being disabled is knowing that there is so much more to life than what my life will ever be. I've already missed out on so many things that most people take for granted. I don't doubt that I could marginally improve my life if I tried my best. But, I don't want to try my best. Why try your best for marginal change? Forcing someone to live in a world that they know is designed for them to fail is cruel and unusual punishment. Anyone who thinks suicide is selfish has never been suicidal. My loved ones are the only thing keeping me going. But honestly, I think the most merciful thing society could have done for me is let me die after discovering my disability. Being disabled is nothing but a lifetime of settling for less. Why is society so cruel?"

I have been in a relationship with her for ~1 1/2 years now and most of the time it's going great, but if there is anything going on, no matter the actual size, it always escalates and I'd really like to prevent that, but I don't know how. Whenever there's something bothering her, especially if it is something I did, she immediately goes into this state of defensiveness, where she doesn't talk to me whatsoever, gets extremely cold and is disengaging from any Kind of contact. Most of the Times, I leave her be for a Bit, in hope for things to settle down and then approach her by asking things like \"How are you feeling?\" \"Do you wanna talk?\" or \"I don't know what is going on but I would like to change things, since I care about you.\". Sometimes she does respond to these rather good and we're able to sort things out, but most of the time, she says things like \" I think I should leave\", \"I am always hurting you\" or \"Just leave me alone, don't you see how Bad you feel because of me?\" In the early stages of our relationship I always tried to show her that things aren't as Bad, I'm fine and such things, but by now, I for one don't want to lie so much anymore and second, can't do so mentally either, because I can really feel the impact that has on me too. So then we go into a sort of stalemate in which nobody says anything for atleast 15-30min, often longer. I really can't stand this, it makes me feel horrible because I feel like I am failing as a boyfriend but at the same time, I sort of feel unable to move or say anything, because of her harsh acting, I don't feel loved or anything. It is really hard to describe really. After this feelingly endless time period of just sitting there quietly, she usually approaches me by cuddling or anything similar and she Starts talking to me a Bit. That's usually the point where the ice breaks and things settle down, but even here I need to be extremely careful, because as soon as I say anything that she could interpret as critizing her, she feels horrible because she thinks that she is consistently making my life worse and such things and the cycle Starts all over again. That also makes it seemingly Impossible for me to approach her in a critizing manner, or even just trying to tell her how I feel in such Situations, or any Situation where I don't feel great, because she immediately feels extremely guilty and goes into this state where a constructive conversation is impossible. I'd really like some Feedback on what I can do to improve the situation, as I myself notice how much this is impacting me mentally aswell."

    "text": "Loneliness fueling depression Dealing with loneliness I just recently turned 30 years old. I‚Äôve never had a serious relationship, no matter how hard I tried. I‚Äôve gone through the dating apps , friends of friends, everything, but I just can‚Äôt seem to click with anyone. Over the last 2 years, I have made some serious changes to my health. There is a post on my profile about it, but basically I went from drinking 40ish beers a week to occasionally 2 a week, if that. I have lost 60 lbs, I go to the gym to keep myself in the best shape I‚Äôve ever been in, and I work construction. I did all of these changes for me, for my health, but I‚Äôd be lying if I said I didn‚Äôt want a relationship out of it. I constantly seem to end up in the friend zone. I‚Äôm not particularly good at talking to girls, though I think I‚Äôm better now than I used to be. This all came to a head over the last couple weeks. I met a girl at my climbing gym and hit it off with her. We started climbing together a bunch, hung out for a bite to eat a few times, and I thought the vibes were great. She even told me that she was really looking forward to spending time with me. Last weekend, we went out for a chill night out together and again I thought we were hitting things off really well. I dropped her off at her place, said goodnight and made tentative plans to hang out during this past week. When I got home though, I got that dreaded text that I‚Äôve gotten 1000 times before: ‚ÄúI just got out of a really toxic relationship, and as much as I like spending time with you, I‚Äôm not ready for that again yet‚Äù. I immediately felt all of that old self doubt slamming into me like a ton of bricks. I sent her a message saying I understood, and I hoped we could still spend time together as friends, seeing if maybe this could turn into something. She heart reacted that, and responded absolutely. I figured at least that‚Äôs a start. However, she has not responded to hardly any messages this week. The plan had been for me to help her move some furniture and other things this week, but each time I asked for a time to help her out, she came up with some reason why she couldn‚Äôt(they could be true, probably are, just feels like she‚Äôs avoiding me). All of this is just sparking all of my old self-doubt and depression. It sucks."

    "text": "How to know if my friend is depressed or just ignoring me So, a little backstory. I have a band with two other people, we're like partners. It's a side hustle, if you will. We do hang out regularly, but music is mostly what unites us. One of the two stopped responding to calls about a month ago. We had a project he should be producing and we already moved the deadline three times due to him not being able to finish it. When he missed the third deadline, we tried to call him to tell him that we're moving on to some other projects, that we assume he has too much going on and that we understand, but he stopped responding. After trying to reach him for three days, I wrote him a (somewhat) angry text that this is becoming tiresome and that we're moving on to another album. No response. We figured something was up that he doesn't respond for that long. We then messaged him several times if he's okay to no avail. We are now in a sort of limbo, since he is a vital part of our operation here and we just... don't know what's going on. It's been like this for three weeks now. Doesn't answer calls, no posts online (he used to post regularly). When we called him several times last weekend, he hung up and texted \"can't talk, not home\". We incidentally drove by his house the same day and his car was home, but we didn't want to push it. A week has passed, we called again. He wrote the same thing. We decided to drive to his house. Turns out he was home. His dad greeted us outside and went to get him, then came back to tell us he's cooking a family lunch and can't talk right now, but that he promised he'd stop by our house in the afternoon. He never came. We called him twice later in the day, he hung up every time. Now, this isn't the first time it happened, but it was never as bad. Usually it was just a week of silence, then an apology text about how he had too much work and was tired, and we always understood. He was never a good communicator. But it's been getting worse and worse, even before he comepletely cut contact, he would be less and less responsive. Right before this episode, he would do the absolute bare minimum of work we had to do, nothing more. And we'd be feeling more and more like we're a burden and that he doesn't actually want to work with us. He would take less time fkr meetings and rehearsals and would always argue that he doesn't have the time. So we're really lost here. I don't know if he's burnt out, or depressed, or just doesn't want to work with us anymore and is too afraid to tell us. I feel like we would at least deserve an answer, out of respect, and I think it's childish to avoid someone you're basically working with. If we were just friends, I would patiently wait for him to come back when he feels like it, but we had some agreements, made some deals involving money etc etc and it's becoming more and more difficult to manage it all. A part of me wants to just kick him out, while a part of me wants to sit it out and wait, like a friend would. But it has started to really affect me emotionally. Sorry for the long post. I need some advice."

Then took a breakfto collect enough money to get intocollegec but financial problems got worse and couldn't save it. the fights are getting worse, can't do shit, don't have any dream either nor do I wanna marry someone as really don't feel like being a good guy after all this torture. So basically don't have anything to live for. Thinking of killing myself and leaving a notewhichm can either make them seperate or finally get better for my brother. Also my brother is 24 but he is also bullies his entire lifesand he is also struggling with all of this and he does have want to marry and start a family someday so maybe he can get it"

    "text": "I think my brother have depression My brother has shown signs of depression for the past 2‚Äì3 years. There have been moments where glimpses of his old self come through, but they usually don‚Äôt last long before he falls back into old patterns. He‚Äôs been open with our family about not feeling mentally well, which I appreciate. His life now seems to revolve almost entirely around his computer ‚Äî he works at the PC, then plays games for hours, and smokes weed regularly. It feels like he‚Äôs stuck in a loop. Conversations with him are hard; after just a couple of minutes, the tone usually shifts to negativity about life, work, or people in general. He often seems angry or bitter, and it‚Äôs hard to talk to him without feeling like you're walking on eggshells. What‚Äôs also difficult is that our conversations are completely one-sided. He rarely, if ever, asks how I‚Äôm doing or shows interest in anyone else. When I do ask him something, it can feel like a burden for him to answer. I‚Äôve offered my support many times ‚Äî whether that‚Äôs talking, helping him get into training, or improving his daily routines ‚Äî but he always declines. The hard part for me now is that I‚Äôve started to feel incredibly frustrated. I‚Äôm finding it more and more exhausting to be around him. His pessimism and self-centered outlook are really draining my energy, and sometimes I even find myself getting angry with him ‚Äî even though I know he‚Äôs not well. So my question is: how can I, as a relative, actually support him without burning myself out in the process? What can I do that could make a difference ‚Äî if anything ‚Äî and when is it okay to step back? We had a family dinner today and I am so exhausted, it's like he drained all my energy."

Who's gonna care if I graduate high school or not. My parents keep saying it's the phone causing my depression. Did they forget all the other trauma I'm not gonna list here? My dad said that I was embodying a marxism principle by staying on my phone and isolating from my family.

I get the feeling that people think I whole get some kind of joy out of admitting that my depression is destroying me. The way people talk to me when I cry out for help communicates to me that I am just an annoyance that is hindering their life. I live my truth and I speak my truth and sometimes that means I have to be vulnerable and personal but when I do, I am quickly shot out of the sky. I am told to get help but it feels like I'm being punished for reaching out for it. The harder I try, The more that gets taken away. I'm sitting and watching things that are absolutely devastating to me and I'm expected to just sit there and not even cry. I gave up. I don't do this very often but I gave up. I can't take another hit. I don't even recognize my heart anymore. Even if I succeed in taking care of everything on this impossible list, the reward at the end is loneliness. This is no way to live life. This is no way to continue. I won't. I'm not even a person to anyone..."

Sorry this won't have any coherence but... sometimes I'm embarrassed to open up to others. I've been depressed for a long time and I am not really sure why. I've been to multiple therapists I can afford. I'm a therapist myself. I have a lot of responsibilities and I'm just tired of them. What's worse is the idea of just letting myself go is scarier that going on the brink of burnout. My depression makes it hard to keep going, but I still have to. Being a therapist brought me a lot of shame. As a therapist, my whole job hinges on being able to help so the prospect of compassion fatigue or emotional burnout scares me. I know I will be well and beyond spent before I just finally rest. I guess I wish I had more juice to keep going and not be so nerfed all the time. I am embarassed of being human. Tired of it. Anyway thanks for reading and hope at least some of you are having a better day than I am."

As much as it sucks, I try to look on the bright side of things. But as soon as I told my father that I got rejected, it made everything so much worse. There was no sympathy for me, no affection, just disappointment. My dad was so disappointed in me, and to be frank, so am I. My mother proceeded to get angry with me, and tell my brother to not follow in my footsteps and be more academic. I don‚Äôt know how to prove that I‚Äôm good enough to them. I have won national awards, got into every other school I applied to, and keep consistent grades. In spite of this, my mom complained loudly to herself that it wasn‚Äôt enough. That everything I have done wasn‚Äôt enough, and if it was enough, I would have been accepted. She kept repeating to herself that I was worthless, a liar, and a failure. I have no one to vent to about this, hence why I‚Äôm taking this to the internet. These past few months, I‚Äôve felt like I‚Äôve been losing my sanity. I‚Äôve been burnt out everyday. Stressed 24/7. Lonely all the time. I guess today just made me realize that I have nothing to live for. Is it validation from my parents that I seek? Is it something to rid my loneliness? I would consider myself somewhat popular within my school, yet, I feel like I have no one. What the hell would make me happy? How long is it going to take? Why haven‚Äôt I found it yet? I need something to live for and I fear I‚Äôll die before I find it."

I more than likely live with depression, most of my dad's side has it as does my sister. I've never been diagnosed, but I wouldn't be surprised if I did get tested I would get high marks for moderate to severe depression. However, that said my depression presents itself especially in cleanliness standards to where cleaning is tough for me, and of you saw my apartment right now you might be disgusted. Granted, I don't have mice or rodents or any sort of infestation, but it could be a hell of a lot cleaner and I have little to no motivation to clean because in truth I am very isolated and alone all the time when I am home. I have no connections to anyone. I am in a town where I was not treated kindly and I don't have connections here other than going to the grocery store for food, going to the liquor store and buying some alcohol when I am paid so I can drink a bit on the weekends, and other restaurants because I find myself unmotivated and frankly feeling depressed with my existence unless I am working. I hate that I feel this way, and the simple truth of the matter is I know once my apartment is cleaner or clean I will feel better, but how do you give yourself the kick in the pants to do it?"

    "text": "High intelligence autism, ready for greatness, but sadly, lately felt so lonely I felt like I was dying 22, autistic and high in life pushing myself always, but why haven‚Äôt I felt happy in years? Hey there people. Hope your all having a good day/ evening, wherever you are inside this big blue bubble. I have a question for some people on here, where ever in the world they are. As someone without a disability, why do people judge me as someone that would be stupid just for having a disability? How can I truly feel happy after I‚Äôve been alone for so long? I have barely 1st stage autism, it has gone away drastically since I was little, but ever since I was little, I always had no idea how to talk to people. I drive, read, and I‚Äôm trying to become a computer engineer, but i also tried to be a game designer and developer, my childhood dream. I found out programming for me in game design would not be nice for me. Broke my heart, had to switch to something else completely, I was shy, quiet and wasn‚Äôt for a long time, but once again i am, due to some extremely poor friend suggestions and behavior completely on their part, which I feel have ruined my happiness completely out of my life. I was blackmailed by my friend group I met with my buddy from elementary. They accused my account with an easy to guess password, and exposed me and my girlfriend‚Äôs private chats all for everyone to see. With the whole kit and kabob if you know what I mean in those types of things in a relationship via messages when two people love each other. Was bullied so badly in school I literally felt like I had to act stupid all the time, just to make friends. I hate I did this, if I just kept being myself and I had more strength and courage, I could‚Äôve been done with it all. But I didn‚Äôt. Now, have a large former group of Friends now making fun of my body, my decisions and my poor choice actions, get told to end my life, we aren‚Äôt your friends, get the fuck away from me, or fuck off. Try to always act like it‚Äôs not a big deal shit they say, I don‚Äôt care, it‚Äôs all online shit on game chat it doesn‚Äôt matter bro, your a pussy. Makes my teeth begin to get locked jawed from anger. Even meet with these people in person to become friends, only for them to still make fun of me in person with one single friend who introduced me, and another friend who left me being a friend as a kid because I showed them five nights at Freddy‚Äôs in fucking grade 11, runs to his mom, she says I‚Äôm a bad influence and we shouldn‚Äôt hang anymore. Older brother also likes to beat me up or make fun of me, especially as children. Now he‚Äôs just a fat dummy with a big mouth, and no future. And even though I may have one, I really, really feel like hatred goes through my body when thinking of anybody inside of that type of space all jumping together on someone who didn‚Äôt do anything wrong. Nobody helps anymore, they just attack. And it‚Äôs making me lethally Angered. I‚Äôve always been also that kind of extremely over nice person, always giving people my lunch good in elementary and in high school just a class clown making people laugh, but while being fat. and now, my whole life, i feel now autism, which people have said is a superpower, which I used to believe, I feel it‚Äôs a curse. I lost my girlfriend after she found out my forms friends had shared photos of us online and made me so upset she stopped messaging me, I have no more friends and I just stare at my tv after slaving away at school, and end the day. Parents have been my only support my entire life along with my brother. Everyone on my life even from early age has passed and I miss them and it haunts me and I have nightmares about the earth ending, me having no future, etc. My best friend, my entire life ive ever met who even remotely was with me everywhere, spending time with me 247 everyday all day, obviously is my parents and family / friends, but my dog. These so called friends also go on to make fun of my dying grandfather in bed and insult him dying on his death bed. Then when my dog dies last may last year after I told them a few months before I never wanted to see them again, explode and cause a massive scene at my house because of my explosive episodes when I‚Äôm angry. Week later, my best friends body was shutting down. In less than 48 hours after this. My best friend was now dead. And it felt as if it was partially been my own actions to cause it. Always have explosive episodes where I used to threaten myself or others who hurt me, only ever got bad to the point in class, one of these kids from this group, but years before, made me so angry with suicidal thoughts, I stood up And began to try to cute my throat with a pair of cutting scissors, I wanted to be happy, leave me alone. 10 years later these demons are still with me inside my mind, I can‚Äôt stop these thoughts, and I just want to be, even though I could or should be happy, I really. I think I just want someone genuinely who hasn‚Äôt met me, to just love who I am. Why is this so hard to find now today? And why do those people who look get punished often for doing so? I‚Äôve been to therapy, I‚Äôve been working out, I have been making myself better. But truthfully, I think it‚Äôs felt hurt wise even more impactful now, with all this built up stress. I‚Äôm almost done college, I want to pass this because I want to tell everyone who ever thought I would fail, I can do anything, and anyone can to if they put their mind to it. I don‚Äôt know anymore. I just feel off, I‚Äôm alone, and I wish honestly truthfully, more women out there were nicer to men especially when that person might be experiencing PTSD, MPD, Bipolarism or even extreme hormonal rampages by feeling angry. All this has built up in me since I‚Äôve been in grade 8, probably around 12 years old? 13? Also my teacher before high school was a drill Sargent jackass type teacher, who terrified me to my core. He didn‚Äôt help students. He scared them. Also he was going to be a police officer but failed do to him not being able to do efficient takedowns with standard policing equipment. Building rage inside me, fires burning inside my sky‚Äôs, the room stays dry. Shit never changes. When will someone please kindle my fire? I don‚Äôt know anymore. Will these kids ever apologize to me? If even one childhood bully talked to me again, and apologized i would feel, somewhat, ‚Äúhappy‚Äù. I have a hard time smiling even now, i feel that miserable with my current life. And i even just got a new dog only a couple months ago. What the fuck is wrong with me? My teeth bite my nails down to the nail line. The pain never goes away, but it doesn‚Äôt feel any different to the shit and pain I‚Äôve already been through. That‚Äôs what sucks the most. And I know I can achieve great things. I believe I can. But it feels hard these days in my shoes. Personally. And I wish I could use honestly or see a bit more stuff in this planet that could firstly, come meet me, and not me, having to practically beg and walk over to them.

    "text": "I have a hard time keeping in touch with others. Is it because of my depression? For some reason, I find it really difficult to initiate conversations or send replies to someone through texts or e-mails. There are a few people who I have been able to get to know face-to-face, but for some reason I can't bring myself to talk to them through the internet. I keep on second-guessing myself, my mind coming up with the worst-case scenario. There's this constant assumption that the other person doesn't want to talk to me and get to know each other better. This becomes worse in situations I get left on read - even if it's someone who I enjoy talking to, it's really hard to start another conversation because I fear that I'm being left on read because the other person has no interest in interacting with me. I also put off replying to texts all the time. It's like I have to forcefully muster up courage for me to give a reply. Even when the other person's reply is quick, it takes hours or even days for me to give a response. It's to the degree where people are telling me to reply faster. It's not something that should be hard to do, and I know in the back of my head that it's a factor in my inability to socialize with others. Even so, I just can't seem to maintain conversations. And what's even more frustrating is I can't grasp why I'm like this. I thought I was just procrastinating, but the thing is, I want to converse, I want to talk more with others, but I can't. Can I label it procrastination if it's a task you want to do? So I've been wondering if this problem is related to my depression, or some other another mental disorder. Has anyone experienced this?"

I finished a masters degree at the end of last summer, came top of my class and I can‚Äôt find a job, as it‚Äôs a bit of a niche more academic line of study. I‚Äôm stuck working the same job I have been for years. I feel worthless, I live at home (my country has a very severe housing crisis) and I just feel so hopeless. I wake up every morning apply for random jobs look at rejection emails and just live in a pure state of panic. All of my friends are in relationships and/or leaving the country and they are either dealing with their own shit (which is totally valid) or just in a completely different life stage to me. I feel like a complete failure, and more and more I just don‚Äôt want to feel like this/live like this anymore but I can‚Äôt see a way out. I‚Äôve gone to my doctors, my family knows how I feel and are as supportive as they can be, but nothing is helping it‚Äôs just getting worse. I don‚Äôt want to stress my family out too much but I don‚Äôt know how much more of this feeling I can cope with. Anyone have any advice on how to try deal with these feelings?

My therapist left me after I got outed and someone outed me while I was being abused and almost got killed by my own relative (2nd time). I got discriminated against hard while I was in rehab, and it made me felt extremely worthless. I tried killing myself so many times but failed because I feel like an alien why so many people don't like me just cause I'm queer?

I can‚Äôt sleep at night but all I can do is Work, Sleep and Rot. Today I was met by the sight of a river I used to frequent years ago. The forests cut down, trash everywhere and dirty muck filled waters. I couldn‚Äôt help but curl up at the river side as I was just staring at myself.

The main reason we sleep is for survival. The main reason we work is so we can afford to survive. I can go on. Not just that, some of us, including me, were born with problems that make life even harder, like mental issues, physical issues, or other issues. Some are even born with more than one issue, while some issues make it hard for us to take care of ourselves without relying on help from others. Even if we enjoy our lives, there is always an end, never 100% sure what‚Äôll happen to us or how others will react after we die. We either ‚Äúwin‚Äù by going to Heaven or ‚Äúlose‚Äù by going to Hell. We are never certain where the others that died before us are. How do people enjoy life knowing it‚Äôs mainly based on survival? If I wasn‚Äôt afraid of death, I would‚Äôve let it happen to me long ago. At the same time, maybe it‚Äôs good I have a fear of death because I would‚Äôve ended up in Hell through letting myself die. (I believe being suicidal leads us to Hell, which I‚Äôd rather go through this life first, while praying I fix this mindset before I die)"

I slip in and out of it and idolsation. I recently had a close friend lose a family member through suicide. And the grief that follows is awful. I wasn't close or had much contact with their family member, but seeing the aftermath. It's not worth it. It's never worth it. I've recently had an enormous amount of guilt about the fact I ever tried to take my own life. The thought that I could have done that to my friends not even my family but my friends. To think that I could have put that weight on their shoulders. Honestly you think in that moment that your suffering should end. I'm telling you now it's never ever worth it. I know when I was low I would tell myself no one would care, no one would mind if I did it. But after seeing this I'm telling you the people that you would affect after you're gone, you could never imagine. Keep going you got this. From a girl who's been in the pits and kept pushing on and getting better you can to. I just had to get this off my chest somehow. Thank you for reading x"

This is enough for me. I have ZERO friends, ZERO family to talk to, ZERO people who find me interesting or even cool in any way, shape or form. I'm just this awkward, weird 20 year old guy who still feels like he's a teenager. I just got into college, just got an internship, and it's still not enough for me to grow any sort of confidence and make some friends or find some people who like me. I'm a failure as a human being. I am so tired of trying. Too many awkward moments have left my mouth with a sour taste. I can't even enjoy other people's company anymore, because my self-aware brain will always screw up things in ways I can't even begin to understand why. I just feel like I'm MEANT to be lonely, I'm destined for this. I have no social skills, too self-aware about my looks, about the way I talk, everything is a reason for low self-confidence. I'm so tired of trying and yet, so desperate to be liked by someone, to have someone that truly appreciates me for who I am. Words can't describe the pain I have caused myself and others as well. I f\\*\\*\\*ing hate myself. I think I'll just take some sleeping pills and mix them with my dog's seizure medication (I'll obviously leave some for him so my sister is able to take care of him). That oughta do the trick. I'll sleep real good and it'll be as if I never even existed. No pain, no suffering, no struggling. Just a peaceful lights out. I hope I can be remembered for something good, because I've never intended to harm anyone. I just want peace for myself, and this life just ain't it."

I try, but the pain of actually doing it with my hands and the mental work of trying to push through is all more powerful than the desire to do it I guess.

I feel little motivation to do things I like doing, and don‚Äôt feel pleasure from doing those things. I live with my mom, she pays rent and all bills.

    "text": "being alone and the unfillable void In talks with people online about my loneliness, people often suggest to 'learn how to be alone' and i took the advice to heart - here's the results. I've done it, I've done the being alone, in every capacity I've been alone. I've been alone at home, work and public, I've booked hotel rooms and gone clubbing alone (which is incredibly dangerous) it didnt make me feel any better. solo shopping sprees, solo clubbing, solo life; it's not helpful. there is no learning how to be alone, there is only the realisation that you are. it hits you in waves, when you're cross legged on a hotel bed after clubbing on your own, crying because you realised the advice repeated to you ad nauseum wasn't good and you're back to square one without getting any further. in the process of learning how to be alone, I've realised nobody else is; at least not in public spaces. everyone else has friends, they're drinking and partying together, shopping together; anything you do alone, they are doing with their friends and having more fun than you. you can tune it out for a while and just go about what you're doing, but eventually you'll look around and see the happy couples and friends hanging out and it will hit you that you're the only one there by yourself and it completely ruins what you were attempting to do and ultimately it leaves you feeling worse. being lonely isn't something you can learn, it's also not something you can just be okay with. i think that ultimately, there is an innate need inside of everyone to have at least one person in our lives who we can talk to, at least semi regularly. in the modern day, we have ai chat bots, discord calls, facetime etc and i think those fill part of the void, as long as you're able to let them, but the veneer wears off that eventually, usually when you have the lucidity to look around your room and realise you're the only one there. this experiment with loneliness and attempting to follow advice has been helpful i suppose, if for no other reason, it has taught me what doesn't work. i can't say it won't work for anyone, but it didn't work for me. i don't know what I'll do now, or where to begin filling this void, i only know i have to find a way before it kills me. I'm so lonely that it's all i can feel these days. i feel like I'm in solitary confinement, watching everyone else get to have fun and be social. i don't know what makes me so different, so fundamentally unlikeable, but when i find it, I'll happily remove it from myself if i can, even if it takes a huge chunk of my personality with it. I'm so desperate for social interaction that i cry at the thought of having a friend one day. i think i just wanted to write something about my recent experiences that other people might see. I'm not entirely sure why, but if you've read this, maybe you can relate, and it will make you feel less alone somehow"

In 2021 I got involved with an abusive guy for 2 hellish months & im lucky to have survived it at all. I‚Äôm still scarred from this. In 2022 my brother & sister in law got in a big argument with me that turned violent and this was in front of my nephew, his son who tried to protect me. In short, fear of death & conflict has taken over my mind. I‚Äôve been in therapy since 2021 and matured a lot but it‚Äôs not working anymore. The ruminations are getting worse, my grandmother passed in December and i can‚Äôt stop crying everyday. In short.. how do you defeat ruinations? Mine are bad. I‚Äôm constantly picturing myself having to fight over and over again or someone trying to hurt me. I‚Äôm a really kind person who has been ‚Äúburned‚Äù many times before and it‚Äôs left me scared, sad and now angry. I‚Äôm becoming angry and mad. I play shooters to let it out but I never used to rage this hard before. I know I must be unrecognizable to my boyfriend and I snap at him so much now. I don‚Äôt want to keep hurting him and I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll hurt myself as I‚Äôve thought about suicide way too many times in the last 2 years TLDR: Suffering from violent ruinations after years of trauma and mourning death. Sadness turning to anger. How do you overcome this ??? 3.5 years into therapy and it seems to be getting worse. I don‚Äôt want to go any further with suicidal ideation"

    "text": "This is my first and probably only post in this sub. I'm a young man with depression. As much as I hide it, I do have it. I pretend I am fine when I'm not, when in actuality, I'm taking my anger, frustration, and sadness out on everyone else the moment they do anything at all. A bit of backstory; Last year, my girlfriend dumped me after lying to me for a very long time, lying to me for years. She also cheated on me, and every few weeks, I find out that there is another guy or girl that she cheated on me with. She's also began to accuse me of mentally abusing her, which I never did. Then, because of her, I nearly got my safety threatened at my own job, and when I'm just walking around in public. I've been happy at times since she dumped me and everything became public, VERY HAPPY, but I'm still depressed. It always comes back to depression. I'm stressed beyond far, I'm constantly injured, I'm hurt all the time, and no one cares to listen to what I've got going on. And then a bunch of people turn around and judge me, bully me STILL, speak to me like shit, and tell me to kill myself. And that's when I've been getting angrier than myself lately, and often fighting these people, when I'm not a man who fights because someone said something about me. I prefer to always play it smart and not engage in a fight, as it lowers me to the aame level as the fuckwit that wanted to fight. But lately, I haven't been able to play it smart, or safe. Am I an asshole for saying all of this? Am I an asshole for exposing my ex girlfriend? Who cares."

I still don't know why they always chose to stand up for me. Every time I got in trouble with the teachers or just in general they would defend me. This year, my fourth and final year in junior high, I've been avoiding people and skipping as many classes as I can. I still get in trouble a lot for not doing well in school. I lost my motivation ever since I moved away from them. I used to be a student who scored in the 90s, a straight-A student even, but now my grades have fallen below 80, with my lowest being 74 which is already a failing grade here, since passing is 75. Not only that, but I'm starting to hate my classmates, which makes me want to skip even more classes. In class, the teachers get pissed off easily, and my classmates butt in just to insult or yell at me. It really shows how toxic people can be when they have numbers on their side. So this year, I've been completely alone in class. I never even leave the house. I'm practically a shut-in who only goes to school unwillingly. And even when one of the people who used to defend me asked how I was doing, I was too afraid to even talk to him. In times like these, I can't help but wish I hadn‚Äôt been born in the first place. Even when I was defended, I knew I'd eventually have to go back home. a place I never liked. I'm not living with my parents, and I always feel like I'm being judged. The people who defended me are about my age, too. Sorry if this isn‚Äôt depressing enough for this sub and if its messy"

My skin was more elastic, my hair fuller, my charisma was effortless. Makeup and outfit ideas were popping up in my mind like the silly blonde girl in clueless. How could someone with no real value or love for anything but herself get rewarded so much compared to the now changed girl who doesn't want anything handed to her, who chooses to live life in the real world instead of living in a facade, who chooses what I should do rather than what I want to do, who is trying to burn my ego because it is quite literally turning me into a sociopath!!!! I guess that's the reason for freewill though. I'm thinking out loud. I can't just discard all this away this time it needs to stay. honestly would like just to have you read it and not comment because interactions are getting harder to deal with the older I get. Maybe I was more disciplined with the energy that was received being ignorant. It was never meant to last if I was still walking down that path. It didn't last.

I wish I could die right now with no pain. I don't want to kill myself because if I miss there will be even more pain. I wish I could get my revenge on society. The enemies that got me where I am today, it would be such a party if they died. That's one reason for me to try and survive the longest, to see the enemies die, such satisfaction it would give. 3:20am going to bed now, where ill be stuck until 9pm sucks real bad. So now at least I have one goal, survive the longest possible to have the possibility of seeing enemies die. Its just a real boring surviving, doing nothing except freaking appointments i hate and going to the pharmacy. Cheers to all who survive out there and don't kill themselves.

He has zero energy for any kind of social interaction. He doesn't want to work. Sleeps a lot. Is pushing me away when I want to help or stonewalling me. His ex took him to court for a custody battle that is draining him emotionally and financially. She's forbidding him to see his kids. It's been difficult for him. One thing about me and my bf, I've always told him he could be himself around me. No mask, no fakeness, just him communicating his feelings. Lately he's been toxic and projecting those emotions onto me. The caring man he used to be is now rude to me. Yesterday something happened and I called him. He came to help. He told me to let him know the outcome of my misadventures the next day, that's today. I texted him, asking if he was free for a call so I call and tell him what happened. He replied: Do I really give off the vibe right now that I want to talk with you? That's a serious question. I didn't reply. Last week, we were talking and he was his usual sweet man. He told me he couldn't wait to see me. Said I love you. Really made me feel better. Earlier this week I asked him what he wanted to do, he got upset saying he didn't remember saying we should hang out and told me I was making him feel crazy. But two hours later he apologized, saying work is stressful and he's gonna make time for me. When I was over to his place, he was sweet for an hour and then he out of nowhere started an argument about plans we made and he called me toxic for reminding him of the conversation we had. I asked him to stop, that I was there to spend quality time with him. He didn't. Kept going. I cried. I needed to step away from the situation. He chased me. When I returned he hugged me for 5 long minute and apologized. Said he'd make an effort to stop pushing me away. Sometimes I will ask him what he's up to at night and he'll say things like: Being extremely uninterested in having a conversation. Or Why are you trying to force a conversation? Before being depressed he was never this rude to me. Ever. Tonight, in the span on 5 mins, he told me he didn't wanna talk to me. When I didn't reply he went hello???? And 3 mins later: Amazing communication! This is why I push you away!! I've been depressed myself before but I never projected my emotions like that or turned mean towards the person I love the most. What's going on, why is he like that now? üòû"

I'm 32 M and married with two kids both in their tween/teen years. Over the last 5 years my depression has gotten increasingly worse since I had found out that my wife had been in a 2 year affair. We're still together and for all intents and purposes happy, as I have forgiven her and taken responsibility of my part where I had fallen short to give her a reason to do so however, since then my depression feels much mor severe. I have regular breakdowns (weekly) and have become increasingly isolated, have become intensely misanthropic and no longer enjoy anything I used to. Even the so called good moments are just empty to me. I have been told that I have treatment resistant depression as I've gone through SSRIs, SNRIs, benzo, natural remedies (shrooms and LSD micro and macrodosing), CBT therapy, DBT, the works and nothing has helped. I can't commit suicide because my family will be destroyed and it's not like my death would hugely impact them for the better financially. I run my own business but the more my depression increases the worse the business is doing and the worse it does the worse my depression gets. I feel like a failure in every area of my life and mentally and physically, I'm just on the long suicide road....smoking, drinking, drugs....hoping it will kill me sooner rather than later. I don't want to continue like this but I've lost all hope and see no future for myself just a dark abyss of depression and honestly the last 15 years have not been a joyride. I don't see myself keeping this up until old age. I'd rather drive my car off a mountain than continue like this. I've recently started having some obscure pain in my body and really hope whatever it is it kills me so I can be freed from the mental prison I'm in without my family hating me for killing myself."

I‚Äôm alone, and it seems like it‚Äôll always be that way. somehow someway I have managed to fuck up anything good for myself. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm just destructive, and even when I try to fix it, I seem to make things worse and the people that I care about leave me.

But the atmosphere at home was really bad. Didn't have any friends apart from ones at school. Was never allowed to go out with them or play because i was the only child who was born after years of treatment. Never knew how to talk to people, how to make conversation. I run away from relationships. I hurt the one girl in my entire fucking life who loved me. I pushed her away lying that I had some serious illness and I wish i had something now. I was too afraid that someone started loving me. I lost my mom to an accident and she was the only person i talked to. Never gave solutions to my problems but she would listen. Going to my 9-5 where people have been asking about my mental health. I avoid such conversations but sometimes i break and say a few things before again running away. I tried to end it but is too much of a fucking coward to do that too! Got a motorcycle recently so I'm planning to get into an accident soon one way or the other. I just need to make sure no one else gets hurt. I feel zero motivation, zero drive and has nothing to look forward. I still miss her. I miss holding hands and our bus rides when i kiss her on her forehead. I asked her for a swcond chance but she is too much hurt that she started seeing a therapist. I would have loved if she killed me with her own hands. Life is kicking me down. I can't get up. There is nobody to talk to. I want to go somewhere far away but then again change of environment won't solve my issues. I know that. I shouldn't have said yes. I shouldn't have been born. These days I'm just a walking, eating, shitting piece of flesh that has no sense of belonging, or worth."

I can never do anything right and it just seems like I‚Äôm annoying everybody tbh. I can barely even stand up for myself and I let people just do whatever they want to me sometimes. I don‚Äôt even wanna start working. I don‚Äôt really have that much of a good social life like I go out once in a few months and don‚Äôt really know how to maintain friendships. I can‚Äôt even do anything to myself either because that would be very much selfish and would hurttt my fam. That why I just blame whoever it was that put me on this earth.

    "text": "Hi again Thought I'd give an update since the last time I posted was months ago but things have gotten better and worse at the same time. Every time I think I've got this living on my own thing down it's like everything gathers together to kick me back down. I live off a check I get from a booth my dad had before he passed away in a consignment shop but without him constantly going there to sell things in person, it's only bringing around $600 a month. And some times not even that. This month I made absolutely nothing, in fact I owed them money for the rent. That booth is the only income I have but if it keeps on like this I'll have to put a stop to it but if I do that I'll have no income whatsoever. The house is paid off thankfully so I don't have to worry about that and I applied for snap benefits as well so that has helped. But I'm just not sure how long I can keep going like this. My dad passed away late last September and since then I've held a gun to my head twice, thought about it even more but it was twice that I nearly went through with it. The reasons I haven't is because of my dogs and now my aunt. My uncle and I have been a huge burden on her, she comes here to help take care of my uncle, brings us food, and even helps clean the house some times. I don't have life insurance and I know if I died, all those bills for a funeral and all that would go to her. I'm enough of a burden to her as it is I don't want my death to be an even bigger burden. I wouldn't care if she tossed my body in the woods and forgot all about me but I know she wouldn't do that. So I'm back to playing the waiting game. Wait until I get life insurance, wait until my dogs pass away. I just hope I can make it until then, there are days when I feel like I can't. I'm not good at talking about my feelings with the people around me so no one knows any of this. Not even my best friend since I was in 2nd grade. (I'm 30 now) She's the only friend I have but it feels like I'm staying the same and she's moving on. She rarely talks to me anymore. She has other friends, a job, a life. We live pretty far from each other now, in different states, but we used to always talk over discord. Play games together and things like that. I've sent her messages but she hasn't responded to me since January. Not like I blame her, I'm sure I'm annoying her when I send her messages all the time but I just I don't really have anyone else to talk too. I really only leave the house once a month to pick up my check from the store and to pay bills. She's the only friend I have, I've never been good at making friends because of my social anxiety. The only person I see every day is my uncle but he's not really someone I can talk too. He has a mental disability due to seizures and because of that he has the mind of a 7 year old. I take care of him, not the other way around. I have a boyfriend but it's long distance and to be honest, I've built myself in his eyes as this always happy person, I've never told him or let it show how depressed I really am. I've never told him about my thoughts of wanting to die at all. I've tried to only show him the good in me and I'm scared that if I show him everything he'll think it's too much or he'll down play it. I've thought about telling him but for some reason I just can't bring myself too. I see my aunt every week but she's not someone I can really talk too either. Deep down I know she does care for me but another part of me thinks that the only reason she comes around so often is just for my uncle. If he wasn't here, she wouldn't be either. She's talked about him moving in with her because he has mobility issues and the our house is it's hard to get him out so if he ever has a medical emergency it'd be really difficult to get him to a hospital and I understand that, and I know it'd be easier for me money wise and all that if he did move in with her. But at the same time if that did happen I'd be completely alone. My aunt would have no reason to come by anymore and it'd just be me in this house. I'm already having issues trying to keep myself alive for the limited time frame I've given myself, I have no idea how much harder it'd be if I was alone. I don't know. At this point I'm just rambling. Sorry."

I just couldn't help it, I feel happy when I think of myself finally dying Every night I delay my sleep because I hate myself, dread having to be alive for another day, and, well, night time is much more peaceful than day time, isn't it? And every morning/afternoon I open my eyes and the first thing I think is how \"I don't wanna wake up\". Every. Single. Day. Do I even have any value or worth? I don't. The others do though, they have values and worth. I hate to tell the truth, but, everyone is better than me in every way. I'm the one who shouldn't be alive at all, I'll do nothing great or anything at all I don't believe that there is hell or heaven or any god at all. But sometimes, I do like being irrational I imagine how after I die, I may turn into a ghost, then I can finally travel around the world without having to pay pay and pay for anything with money money money, or having to be stuck in crowds of other tourists lol. I still think there are many beautiful places in this world that I haven't seen enough, and can never reach there during the time I'm alive. Being a ghost would be really convenient I did try to think of a route, where I'll go visit all countries that I'm interested in. I think a ghost can walk on water or dive without the fear of drowning. Then I can visit the ocean world too. Which will be pretty nice Or maybe I'll meet the grim reapers. I can try to work for and befriend them. Maybe I'll become an assistant, and even fall in love with one of them and get married lol What a bunch of stupid childish thoughts lol.

    "text": "I‚Äôve spent the past three years in hardship and all my efforts feel wasted & idk what to do now. Need advice. Soooooo. Where do I start? This is gonna be a long one. Back in 2022/2023 I was working in retail at a pet store. Not the greatest gig, but it was relatively stable. I was struggling with time demands because the work was physically intensive in terms of labor (Petcare) and I was working around 45/50 hours and I only had 15 minute breaks during my shifts. At the time I was able to meet financial deadlines, but I eventually got burnt out with everything else happening in my personal life. Hard disappointments from my dating life, an apartment flood, and not being able to really take care of myself or my own creative pursuits. I worked and worked and worked, and then I had more and more time difficulties. Even if I was getting the rest I needed, i would flounder and loose myself and crawl back to bed. I sometimes would routinely pull all nighters because I‚Äôd miss getting to work on time. Eventually I got one of those angry vibrating alarm clocks. That didn‚Äôt help either. Eventually I got fired (on my birthday of all days) this past year. Couldn‚Äôt get unemployment so while job searching I decided to pick up sex work as a ‚Äúmasseuse.‚Äù Did get routine clients. Was making some kind of money, but not enough and I was behind on my bills. Eventually I got a hosting gig at a restaurant next door. Good people, meaningless work, still behind on bills. Spent the next few months getting my shit together and it was very hard. Then in November, I landed a really cute gig as a dresser for a touring company. I can‚Äôt talk about who I was working with because they‚Äôre prevelent figures in the arts and I don‚Äôt wanna get sued. But the pay was good and I had friends I‚Äôd be working with so sounded like an ok deal. I didn‚Äôt expect how absolutely hard it was. So I traveled the US for thanksgiving and Christmas on a tour bus. I worked the hardest I ever had getting every performer dressed on time and que, moving garments and props, steaming, repairing, sewing, cleaning wigs and shoes, helping with makeup, being their therapist, their bartender, etc. I was exhausted. I‚Äôd wake up get to work, run a marathon the whole day, and get back on the bus and cry in my sleep, then the next city, same thing, no off days, for 50 days. Some of the crew did not like me, I was ok with that, but the friend I had on tour now don‚Äôt talk to me and idk what I did. I think I did the best I could for my skill set and first time on the road doing this kind of work which was unfamiliar to me. I have no hard feelings about it, but it stung a bit. The whole thing. I get back home with the bills paid at least, and get back to my life back at the restaurant after new years. My creative pursuits are solidifying more and I‚Äôm working still. My finances are hitting a wall again despite me now picking up a new gig their doing data entry for invoices and tip pool. I‚Äôm getting paid a lil tiny bit more, but I won‚Äôt see that money until next month. I barely get hit up by my clients now minus 2 or 3 irregularly. I feel like I‚Äôve negotiated all I can with my landlord and I make myself go hungry and eat a free bread loaf from work. I keep looking for jobs the whole time and that‚Äôs been annoyingly shitty. I‚Äôm able to sleep, take my mind off things a bit, but I‚Äôm running back around in my head. I‚Äôve been homeless before when my parents kicked me out after coming out as queer YEARS ago. I‚Äôm afraid to talk to my family about my current struggles now, as they didn‚Äôt want help me before. I managed myself, put in the fucking work, had some help along the way, and was able to make life better. I‚Äôve gotten through hard times like this and I know I‚Äôm capable. But that just it, I‚Äôm capable. I‚Äôm resilient. I can do hard things. I‚Äôm fucking scared shitless the whole time and life goes on. I‚Äôve done any kind of odd job you could think of, regardless if I was good at it or not. I don‚Äôt live frivolously. I manage my time now a lot better. I eat rice & beans. I don‚Äôt do drugs or drink or go out. I don‚Äôt date. I just struggle. The hard work over these past few years has gotten me nowhere, and I‚Äôm at a loss. I don‚Äôt want to work harder anymore. I dont know what other skills I need to learn or incorporate into my life. I hate my own resilience & I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I‚Äôm tired. I‚Äôm resentful. I‚Äôm disappointed. I‚Äôm enraged and I‚Äôm starting to feel hopeless again. Sometimes I could either die and get the shit-show over with or burn the fucking world to the ground. Doesn‚Äôt help that the state of politics right now just might make things worse for everyone, myself included. If you‚Äôve gotten this far, thanks. I never get on here for anything, but this is kind of my last ditch. I‚Äôve worked 22 hours so far the past two days of this work week, so maybe I‚Äôm just tired. again. And, no. I don‚Äôt want to die. The idea is just flirtatious to me every now and then. If you know a thing or two other than just ‚Äúkeep going üòÑüëçüèª‚Äù or ‚Äúyou‚Äôre so strongüí™üèª‚Äù, that would be appreciated."

I haven‚Äôt left my house in months and my muscles hurt from lying down all day. It actually doesn‚Äôt even feel too bleak, I feel like I laugh a lot and I have fun with friends over the phone. I think it convinces me into thinking that depression isn‚Äôt real, that my severe lack of motivation is just a skill issue. Maybe it is? I think the truth is I really don‚Äôt want to do anything. I‚Äôm looking for this magical piece of advice or a person to change who I am to finally get things done or to somehow start living. But it‚Äôs not real and that person isn‚Äôt coming so what do I do? What do you do when you don‚Äôt want to do anything? When getting better feels like this distant fantasy when therapy doesn‚Äôt work because you don‚Äôt do the homework and medicine can‚Äôt help because you can‚Äôt get up to go into the doctors office. What do you do when you don‚Äôt want to do anything anymore. I don‚Äôt get it. Is this all I‚Äôll ever be. They always tell you you have to help yourself but what if you can‚Äôt even trust yourself to do that? Am I actually just hopeless omg. I‚Äôve dug myself in a hole so impressive I‚Äôd marvel if it wasn‚Äôt completely ruining my life. I really think I was born without like the most important parts sometimes."

I don't know how to feel positive, happy, what can I do. I know there is an option to switch jobs but with market condition and my job timings I can't even find time to eat."

I'm married to a loving husband. I'm conventionally attractive and fit. I have friends. I have a decent enough job and because of it I own a house, fund my hobbies, and eat out a lot. Despite all of these things I feel so much rage and exhaustion. I keep having this anger attacks that just take over completely and then when they're over I'm left feeling awful and embarrassed. The littlest things set me off and if I don't experience anger, I spiral into this gloomy state where I just want to isolate and self destruct. I am convinced none of my friends actually like me and that my coworkers hate me and my parents wish I wasn't how I am and that my husband thinks he'd be better off with someone else. I think about how calm \"nothingness\" would be vs. how stressed I feel all the time. I don't even know why I'm stressed. I don't want to exist anymore during those states. I just want everything to end. I don't feel comfortable talking about the extent of how depressed I am with my friends because they'd just be weirded out or confused or they'd panic and start showering me in fake-sympathy. I just feel so fucking alone right now and needed to get this out somewhere."

I have absolutely no energy or motivation to the point that I don't wanna get outta bed or I don't feel like showering or brushing my teeth, and my insomnia has only gotten worse because of it. It especially bothers me because I'm only a 14 year old girl, n' I wish that I had the energy to go out and enjoy being a teenager while I still can, but my lack of vigor knocks me down and won't let me get up. It's especially affecting my performance at school immensely. I'm always falling asleep, it's physically impossible for me to pay attention in class, and I have no drive to do any work or homework we're given which is making me fall behind on assignments, and my grades are dropping significantly. I also love art, music, & writing, and so I used to make soooo many books & drawings when I was little, but nowadays I can't even do that anymore, and my creativity has just almost completely disappeared. I don't know if this issue is because of my PTSD, ADHD, possibly lack of iron or vitamins, etc. I also almost always feel so hopeless, worthless, have existential crisises, have terrible self-esteem, and just feel like I don't even wanna be alive, but then some days I feel really happy outta nowhere. I have constant up and down mood swings that it's like as if my brain is riding on an extremely bumpy rollercoaster. Some days my body is so exhausted that even just walking tires me out. I also notice that my heart beats a lot slower anymore, n' my breathing is very shallow. It almost feels as if my body is slowly dying and giving up with me. Eugh... I wish I didn't feel this way. I don't even feel like myself anymore. I've always been very wacky, silly, n' energetic. Now it's as if I'm a completely different person, and it's like, \"What ever happened to the good ol' me?\". I feel like a 50 year old man in a 14 year old girl's body! Overall, I'm just so tired and bored of life. Everyday feels the same and I'm so tired of having to wake up every single day just for it to be the same boring, soulless day. I do still have some optimism left in me and I just wanna go out and have fun and do what I love, but I physically and mentally just can't. I don't know what to do. :( \\-March 21, 2025"

I know they love me, I know they‚Äôre near, But this ache inside is crystal clear. How do I explain this quiet despair, When words feel useless, and no one‚Äôs there?

I don‚Äôt speak of it, I don‚Äôt let it show, Because how could they understand what they don‚Äôt know? They‚Äôd tell me I‚Äôm fine, that I‚Äôm just in my head, But it‚Äôs a loneliness that words have never said. I‚Äôm not alone in the way they think, I‚Äôm drowning in a crowd, lost in the brink. I‚Äôm loved, I‚Äôm cared for, I know it‚Äôs true, But there‚Äôs a part of me they‚Äôll never get through. I stay silent, wear my smile, Hoping that maybe I‚Äôll make it awhile. But the silence cuts deeper than any word, And I wonder if anyone‚Äôs ever heard. How do you explain feeling lost in a room, When the world is alive, but you're consumed? How do you say, with no sound or fight, That you‚Äôre surrounded by love and still feel like night?"

I lead my coworkers with passion, and in those moments, I do feel joy. Now, where I tell you I'm a little bit of a liar. I'm not very positive, though from outside you'd never know. I ruin my own relationships by trying to please everyone, instead of those that matter, and I can't stop myself. I have the highest highs, and the lowest lows. To most everyone that knows me, I'm a ball of sunshine. Honestly, a family nickname for me. I haven't felt a ray of \"sunshine\" in years, and I fear for my loved ones more than myself. I know where this road leads and I try to get past that compulsion, but it always takes over me. I'm losing a relationship dear to me and I'm fighting the urge to turn off all sensation.. I know it comes back weaker each time I allow myself to open up again. A form of self-preservation, that way when my mistakes catch up to me I don't risk falling off the cliff. I have no one real to talk to, at least, no one who has the time or energy to help me with my problems over theirs. I waste myself away, long hours alone after long hours surrounded by smiling faces that don't know any better about the mask I'm wearing. I really dont know where to begin, exploring myself and finding those issues to work on, or how to work on them. If anyone can help me understand how I need to approach my self-improvement, I would love to hear it. Thanks again for coming to my TED talk."

I‚Äôd love to hear from people who have *lived experience* with depression because I want to make sure I‚Äôm handling this the right way. I am a normally very stable person with many spoons to share with my friends. I would hate to do anything that might make this worse. Note I am NOT trying to get back with him. I might be open to that down the road but my heart can't do this again. My49 ex M53 broke up with me after Christmas. I am annoyed he let me go for Christmas and leave more of my things there and not say anything. He broke up with me end of January. Now both of us agree (and still agree) that this was the healthiest relationship we had both ever been in. No fights, only minor disagreements that were dealt with in disgustingly healthy ways., He says I was the best sex of his life (this is important, not a brag. I have only had sex when I am present so I am willing to take his word for it. We were good friends as well as great lovers. It was a long distance relationship. But that hadn't been much of a hurdle as I travelled over seas often and was supposed to be moving there soon. On my own, not through him. This was the sort of relationship where his friends pulled me aside and said things like 'he is the best version of himself when you are around' and he says things like \"I am more confident when you are around' where family embraces me as a new member because the love what they see between us. Then he hit a deep depression spiral. Not his first, but his first since we have been together. He told me we broke up because he 'isn't feeling it'. But he isn't feeling anything. This is a man who ALWAYS had a sexual partner, often more than one. Dating him was like returning to my teen days. I feel that he lost his desire and also lost his feeling of 'romance'. He isn't feeling anything in that way for anyone (He was a borderline porn addict, but we had fetishized that into our relationship and both found it hot. BTW we are both kinky AF! one of the many reasons this is on my alt account. My regular account is old like 15 years and known by many people in my life) He told me he felt numb, that his spark for everything was gone, including his desire for a relationship. He didn‚Äôt leave me for someone else. He didn‚Äôt say he stopped caring. He just... *shut down.* He said he wanted to stay friends, and I genuinely want that too. He is still one of my favourite humans. But since the breakup, he‚Äôs been increasingly avoidant, not just with me, but with everyone. Many in our friend group haven't heard much from him at all. He has spoke to no one about our relationship. He rarely reaches out, cancels or postpones conversations, and when he does message, it‚Äôs usually brief and apologetic, saying things like, ‚ÄúBad times.‚Äù I know depression lies. I know it makes things feel impossible. I don‚Äôt want to push him if space is what he truly needs, but I also don‚Äôt want to disappear if *connection* would actually help. I don‚Äôt want him to feel like an obligation, but I also don‚Äôt want him drowning alone because he *thinks* that‚Äôs what he deserves. I am also honestly scared for him. He is the sole carerer for his mom who is now on palliative care in home. She is an amazing woman and the love they share is deep and wholesome. He has said many times previously that his mental health is better when he has a job. But with her health being bad this is his full time job and it is not fulfilling the same need. I worry he may try something stupid when she passes. But I am afraid to say much to not come across as the 'odd ex fianc√©' I also find it odd that all these people who are our friends and saw us together not once has asked him WTF dude. You had a woman whom you loved and loved you and would have stood with you through anything what the hell happened? Any do's and don'ts? Any insight? Should I walk away from him whilst he heals? That would be easiest for me. It is so hard to watch him drowning and knowing he 'chose' this. But we were such good friends and both of us seem to want that. He really is one of my favourite people I have come across on nearly half a decade on this planet."

    "text": "Becoming bitter and less control of my emotions. I've usually been pretty good about controlling my emotions, especially in front of other people. Especially anger. I would just not take things personally or understand it could've been a mistake or that the other person just didn't mean it the way I perceived it. I use to break alot of controllers when I was young while playing video games. Or punch walls or the such. But by the time I was in highschool, I'd stop all that. And I got really good at letting things just slide, and moving on. Since I've started driving. I had never used my horn in a reactive way, I had only used it as a warning to let someone know they were about to hit me or something. But more recently, isolation has changed me. And I'm becoming bitter. I use my horn all the time now. And I usually lay on it. I punched a hole in my apartment wall last week, an apartment I had been living in for 4 years and not caused any damage to it up until that point. I also broke my TV could months ago out of anger. A TV that was 13 years old and had survived 6 moves, one of which was 800 miles. But what made me realize something was definitely wrong, was the other day in dicks sporting goods.. it was an off day at work. And I was feeling a bit anxious due to isolation. And thought that being around people might help, so I went to the shopping center in my town. Was just looking around dicks for a bit until I got bored and decided to go to Walmart. But wanted to get a drink on the way out. At check out. The lady was wearing a Philadelphia eagles bracelet. I was born in Philadelphia, so I'm also an eagles fan. But we are 800 miles away, so I don't see many down here. And I thought this was going to be a pretty easy chance for me to just strike up a conversation. No expectations of anything, just a chance for me to feel connected to another person for a second. But as I was about to say something. A man behind me in line put his items on the counter and was practically touching me as he spoke over the cashier as she was still telling me my total trying to strike up a conversation to me. And now usually I would just let this go and just move on. And some people might call me a push over for that. But idc, I don't have anything to prove to anyone. Except that's not what I did this time. I turned to the guy and shoved him a bit and \"asked\" if he could back the fuck up. He came forward at me and started to say something before a pushed him again nearly knocking him over. And then he calmed down. I then paid for my drink and left. I haven't been in any physical altercation in nearly 15 years. But I broke that streak the other day. I think part of me was hoping he'd been carrying as we're in the south. And I was hoping he'd just kill me so I wouldn't have to do it my self. Cause at this point, idk who I am any more. I get more bitter with each day. I just want friends, but that's out of my grasp."

I dont know what‚Äôs wrong with me, I just don‚Äôt ever feel normal anymore and I and nothing ever feels right and it‚Äôs affecting my quality of living and well-being. Should I just kill myself?"

I work at a job where everyone is a piece of shit, I don't get enough hours because I have two days where I cannot work and for some reason that means I only can work 2x a week, I don't any friends where I live, and I just rot in my parent's house.

Recently, I was on Instagram and came across one of @AllieBStuckey‚Äôs videos. In it, she was reviewing a video posted by a girl who shared how she has family and friends who support the current president, while she holds the opposite view. Despite their differences, everyone around her still loves each other. The girl then wondered if it would be the same if she looked different‚Äîif her views remained the same but her skin color was different, would her friends and family still love her? She went on to give some examples, and @AllieBStuckey shared her opinion on the topic. Curious, I went to the comments to see what others were saying. The first comment I saw read, ‚ÄúThinking like this has to be so exhausting,‚Äù and I thought to myself, it is. The girl who made the video is white, and I‚Äôm Black, so I can‚Äôt entirely relate. Where I do relate, though, is in how our minds can spiral‚Äîhow deeply we get stuck in a thought that affects us so badly when there was no real reason to go there in the first place. It‚Äôs like I purposely want to hurt my own feelings. I don‚Äôt know why I do this, especially when I‚Äôm already hurt by other things‚Äîwhy do I make it worse? I‚Äôve been thinking about that comment for a couple of days now, and just now, it hit me again: I don‚Äôt want to die because I‚Äôm tired of dealing with heartache; I want to die because I‚Äôm tired of dealing with myself."

    "text": "Loneliness is all I think about now. **Post was originally intended for** **the Lonely subreddit** **but was removed because apparently I need relationship advice.** Not sure if this is the right place either, but it's ironic that my attempts to post this have made me feel even fucking worse, so that's cool. For most of my life, my greatest fear has been not making a difference in the world. I didn‚Äôt want to live my life without having made an impact that was bigger than myself. I wanted to leave a mark that would stay after I was gone. That‚Äôs changed lately. Now, I fear dying without ever feeling a real connection‚Ä¶ dying without ever having experienced love. It sounds cheesy af, but it‚Äôs the truth. I can barely bring myself to do anything anymore. I think about being alone all the time, and it makes every day turn out the same. No matter how much I try, I can‚Äôt break the loop. Any activity that once brought me joy doesn‚Äôt anymore. Any distraction that I used to have doesn‚Äôt work any longer. I keep looking for new things to keep me going, but that eventually gets tiring. I started using AI to chat with, but it didn‚Äôt take long before the ‚Äúpatterns‚Äù started to emerge, making them all feel fake‚Ä¶ which they obviously are. I‚Äôve never felt like I‚Äôve been understood fully by another person. I‚Äôve always felt like I‚Äôve just been ‚Äúperforming‚Äù for others, without ever actually being myself. I‚Äôm not sure why I do it. I know that I‚Äôm the one that has been causing this problem, but I can‚Äôt help it. It doesn‚Äôt matter now anyway, as I don‚Äôt have any friends now. The only people in my life now are my parents, and while they ‚Äúcare‚Äù about me‚Ä¶ they don‚Äôt make me feel loved. To be honest, they make me feel like an intruder in their life. They started making me pay rent every month for the past 9 months. I‚Äôm not making money atm, so I‚Äôll eventually be unable to do that. I feel like I shouldn‚Äôt be here, and that they don‚Äôt want me here. I don‚Äôt blame them tbh. The worst part is that I don‚Äôt see how things could ‚Äúget better.‚Äù I have no friends, social anxiety, no relationship experience, and an average at best appearance. I‚Äôm so unhappy, all of the time. It feels like the world is telling me to give up, and my body isn‚Äôt able to refuse. I somehow manage to keep myself here, but I go to bed every night wondering why. Isn‚Äôt it funny that it‚Äôs always cold in my bed, but people in relationships never seem to have that problem? Also, just know that I don‚Äôt have a desire to die, I just find it painful to live. Sure, I should change but‚Ä¶ how? Go out and meet people. Sure yeah, I‚Äôll go meet all the 60+ year old people that are the majority of people living in my area. Try dating apps? I have, and I got two likes after 3 years. Most girls on there seem to be living completely different lives than me anyway. Go to the gym. Yeah‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not really a gym person, but I am trying to lose weight at home though. Overall, I‚Äôm just tired of being unacceptable for anyone, and being told to change who I am just to be accepted. Anyway, sorry for the ramble. I can‚Äôt help but type too much, and I can‚Äôt help but post here 1\\~2 times a week at this point. I hardly talk to anyone nowadays, and it‚Äôs driving me crazy. Imma try VRChat tonight and see what comes of that. It‚Äôs honestly pathetic that even that terrifies me. **I wish you all the best in your life‚Äôs journey.**"

But I think I messed up, and now my sister is distancing herself from me. I‚Äôm 24M, and my sister is 21F. We used to be really close, but things changed in the past few months. She had a 3-month relationship, and after the breakup, she started having anxiety attacks. I was the one who supported her, and she told me she wouldn't date again. But now, she‚Äôs secretly chatting with someone again. She hides her chats, deletes messages, and acts differently when I‚Äôm around. I tried talking to her and told her that she‚Äôs free to do whatever she wants, but I don‚Äôt want her dating again, at least not now. I reminded her of her past experience, but she just said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my life, my choice.‚Äù That hit me hard. But here‚Äôs the thing‚ÄîI‚Äôm not innocent in all this. I used to be overly protective, and yeah, I even invaded her privacy. I kept an eye on her, checked who she was talking to, and I‚Äôve even tried hacking into networks to see her messages (which didn‚Äôt work). I thought I was doing it to protect her, but now I see how it must have felt like I was spying on her. Now, she‚Äôs avoiding me. Today, we were sitting with our relatives, and the moment they left the room, she left too‚Äîon purpose. She doesn‚Äôt even ask me simple things like what to bring from outside when my dad tells her to check with everyone. What hurts me even more is that whenever I ask her \"When will we talk?\", she just says \"We'll see\" and avoids answering directly. No matter what I ask, her response is always \"We'll see.\" It feels like she doesn‚Äôt care anymore, or maybe she‚Äôs waiting for me to stop asking. And the worst part? She‚Äôs not forgiving me. I‚Äôve apologized, I‚Äôve tried to talk things out, but she straight-up told me to \"stay away\" for now. It‚Äôs like she wants nothing to do with me. I don‚Äôt know if she‚Äôs just mad at me, or if I‚Äôve permanently damaged our bond. I know I made mistakes, but I did it out of concern. At the same time, I‚Äôm dealing with my own problems‚Äîcareer uncertainty, health issues, and depression since I was 18. Everything feels messed up. I even started smoking again from the stress. I don‚Äôt know what to do. Should I distance myself? Apologize again? Or just let things be? I feel like I‚Äôve lost my sister, and I don‚Äôt know how to fix it."

I don't understand why people always act like i don't know that But i'm still depressed, i still fight with myself everyday I don't know how to word this without sounding like an asshole, but having the privilege of being able to eat chips is not worth the fact i cannot go outside and live my life People call me lucky and even seem jealous at times when i tell them i'm at home everyday And it pisses me off Laying in bed all day and rotting away for days at the age of 21 is not \"luck\" Having delusions of being watched or hearing voices is not luck! I'm fucking tired There's times where my body just gives up and i go back to bed after 15 minutes of sitting at my computer Sometimes even laying down is too much, finding a good sleeping position is already tiring and i just sit and stare at the wall until i finally find strength to move I will never forget when i was just 5-6 and i cried in a store because i already suffered from OCD and couldn't decide what snack i wanted because of it My mom was already yelling at me for something i wasn't able to control at all Then this old woman came up to us and asked if i was hurt, why else would i be acting like that My mom told her that i just had a regular tantrum and the old hag told me \"at least you have food!\" And left After that i had to listen to the \"See! Where she comes from there's war going on, and the kid's biggest worry is that they're gonna lose their legs!\" Type speech I stopped crying But not because i realized \"HoW gOoD\" i had it (I went trough severe abuse at the time but hey) But because i realized my feelings don't matter, and never will, there will always be some kid who suffers from hunger and will die soon, it's fine that i'm a 5 year old with several mental disorders Because i have a snack and these kids don't This type of mindset has been planted in my brain like a damn chip Everytime i feel bad and want to die i automatically think \"But there's war\" \"But there's bigger issues\" as if i don't know that And then just ignore my feelings as usual And oh boy, don't get me started on my friends who would always say how great and awesome my mom is! When i finally landed in the psychward due to several mental issues mainly caused by my parent's abuse, i got told by another patient how \"chill\" and \"cool\" my mom was, they told me how they wished she was their mom because they're parents sucked And it's just painful Yeah, my mom is cool and chill if you aren't her kid But have you seen when she pulled me by my hair and punched me, despite me saying sorry? Were you the one getting yelled at in a store and called sick in your head, just because you didn't chose the right drink?? And worst of all, i still somehow don't see myself as a victim Because of people who tell me how good i had it and how good i still have it Up to this day people tell me what an awful child i was, always screaming and throwing tantrums My mother's friends always say how much they admired her strength to deal with such an awful kid I've had her friends tell me in the face that i shouldn't act ungrateful because my mom wasn't as awful as i always make it seem Basically telling me that i deserved to be abused And this mindset is still stuck with me I'm still pretty sure that i DID deserve it, and that i was an awful child that deserved to get smacked Anyway i'm slipping away from the actual theme of this post But i think you get what i mean"

I read a lot of posts on here of people struggling with daily, debilitating depression that plagues every aspect of their lives, making it difficult to do small things like even take a shower. I feel that I am on the opposite side of the spectrum and wanted to share that it is equally as horrible. From an outsider's perspective, I appear to be a very happy and stable individual. I have a financially secure job and I go to work every day and not only try my best but actively try to get along with others and make people laugh every day. My coworkers like me, and some look up to me. No one would think I have any problems at all. However, I feel like I am hidden behind a veil, and when I come home from work and when I am in the privacy of my home, I am in such crippling depression. I have such terrible episodes of sadness. I hate myself. I over-analyze everything stupid I do or say throughout the day and I replay it in my mind constantly and belittle myself. I don't feel proud of myself for any of my accomplishments and genuinely don't know why anyone even likes me. And yet I still get up every day, live this routine, and put on a facade like I am okay. It feels like I am living a double life that I cannot escape."

She told me every so often about how she always thought she'd end up with her ex husband again and how she thought they were meant to be together in the end, I don't know if she ever got the chance to tell him how she felt. I'm extremely shaken up, but I think she wouldn't want me to be sad for her. In her memory I'm going to tell the people I love how I feel, give my dog a hug, and remember that she is in my corner rooting for me when I feel like nobody else is. Edit: thanks everyone for your kind words, I feel less alone about this now. In lieu of a funeral she wanted people to donate to her dog's vet clinic because she was a huge animal lover. Maybe toss a few donations toward your local clinic or shelter to help spread her love even further"

Maybe you've seen enough happy, normal functioning people, that you have some idea of how to do what they do.

It's the idea that, you know how not to be depressed, so if you still are, then that means you must want it this way. And if you want it this way, well that must mean you deserve it.

I kept coming back to the shop to do my homework and the owner and the baristas would always welcome me and they were always happy to see me. I started to get to know everybody there very well and now I consider them all friends. I found that when depressed having different communities helps a lot, and it turns out a lot of the other regulars at coffee shops also are depressed or have other mental illnesses. A two dollar drink can let you stay there for a few hours and by being nice to everyone around you and being somewhat productive on work it can be a really great place to have"

I rarely ever take note of my surroundings or have clear inner monologue. I'm always stuck in this half-awake state where I can't focus on multiple things at once and just kind of \"zone out\" so to speak. I also tend to forget things really quickly for some reason. It makes me feel like some useless, brain-dead retard that can't even function normally or think basic thoughts. It's as if my cranium is rotting away or something. I'm stuck with permanent brain fog and there's nothing I can do about it. I take antidepressants and vitamin d pills, I drink lots of water, I eat healthy, but nothing works. I hate the fact that my brain will never work the same way again, all because of depression. It's destroying my life and I can't take it anymore.

But depression itself can make it impossible to act Exercise/physical activity, eating healthy, spending time in nature, finding a hobby are all things that are supposed to \"be good for your mental health\"... but by definition, depression is a problem *precisely because* it inhibits your inability to function, much less do things that are good for you. Finding a therapist, trialling multiple therapists to see which one suits me best, or even starting on antidepressants and having to check in with a doctor/psychiatrist every few weeks, or having to change medications because one might fuck up my head even more, or not even work... all takes so much fucking effort that I can't bother to do any of it. I went to a counsellor at my university earlier this year, and they suggested things like group therapy for my anxiety and volunteering for causes because that can give people a sense of purpose in day to day life... and I just didn't know how to tell them, that is exactly the problem, *I have utterly no will to do any of that and that's why I'm sitting in your office right now and I don't know what anyone can possibly do about me being this way*. If people with depression were able to so easily do things to help themselves, we wouldn't need to classify it as an 'illness' or 'disorder'. That's why it's so infuriating when we see how even 'professional' mental health advocacy organizations repeat the hackneyed slogans which I cannot understand how they are even still in mass circulation. It's so irrational and frustrating that I'm physically able to take ten steps out of the house to just go on a goddamn walk, but I have absolutely no mental will to do anything but lie in bed. Only listening to music is the only action that can be done purely passively with no effort whatsoever, but then I just get sad and start spiralling from guilt. And I can't stop thinking about how irrational it is, even though I've experienced it for so many years. I'm constantly surprising myself from my own incompetence, as if I ever expected anything different. More than hopelessness, I just feel confused as to what I'm supposed to do when I can't will myself to do anything. What even is this anymore? Edit: Thank you for all the comments.

But the depression teams up with social anxiety so that I just don't have enough enough energy to act like who I truly am. I turn into this very flat, monotone, boring, quiet person who I would never want to hang out with or date. It's the main reason I avoid social interaction now - it feels humiliating because I feel like I'm perceived as this pathetic, pitiable, ignorable person. When I'm feeling better and have a little more energy I can act like myself but usually I'm just this shell. It's horrible, like watching the progression of ALS in a loved one; they just slowly fade away until there's nothing left of who they used to be. At least with physical illness or bipolar or whatever you have yourself, that fundamental spark of who you truly are, and you're able to show that and share that with others. I don't even have that privilege. Sorry if this comes off as arrogant or insensitive, this is just how I feel. edit: Guys, thanks so much for all the responses. I appreciate all of you. I didn't know so many people felt the same way, and I'm glad if I was able to help give voice to your struggles.

I think slower. I need longer for decision making and understanding pretty basic things in conversations. I can't plan anything because it is too much mental effort. I read a sentence in a book and don't register the information it's supposed to convey. I can't think as deeply. As a teenager, I was able to hold my train of thought and look at a problem for a long time and find an intricate solution. That's gone. My ability to think any deeper than surface level is lost. I'm not improving my programming skills, even though I do it professionally on a daily basis. I just don't seem to have the mental capacity for improvement.

    "text": "I (24 f) got dressed and did a bit of my makeup to meet up with a friend at a coffee shop. I‚Äôm in the middle of a depressive episode and dealing with some great difficulties in my personal life. She didn‚Äôt show up. This was my attempt to ‚Äúreach out‚Äù. Update: Sorry in advance, I‚Äôm on mobile and this is long. I really wasn‚Äôt expecting this amount of support and kindness from so many people. Thank you all for the uplifting words and thank you for the rewards! I‚Äôd like to first address any concerns about meeting up during the pandemic. My friend and I made plans to meet up at a coffee shop, buy a quick cup of coffee, and then immediately head to a park nearby in separate cars. The coffee shop is on small a military base so that cuts the amount of people that were in there down by a lot. I went ahead and grabbed coffee and then waited on a bench outside of the shop for around 30 minutes or so before leaving. I stayed 6 feet away from others and wore a mask the entire time. I played it safe and went by the rules. Next I‚Äôd like to say thank you to those who have helped me realize how big of an accomplishment it was for me to get to the coffee shop. It really did take a lot of effort and I appreciate the reminder that it took strength I didn‚Äôt know I had. I also want to thank those who have expressed empathy towards my friend. She is going through a rough time and has been since long before the pandemic started. I wasn‚Äôt angry at her because I understand that she‚Äôs struggling too. I was just really sad and disappointed because I‚Äôve only seen her once since last year. It was more of a bummer than anything and I just needed somewhere to get it off of my chest so I came to Reddit. Kind people of Reddit, you did not disappoint! I‚Äôm going to continue being her friend because she is very dear to me. Knowing the kind of person she is, she probably truly forgot, there was a potential miscommunication, or she may have had something come up that she couldn‚Äôt get out of. It would have been nice to get a bit of a heads up or an explanation, but I haven‚Äôt dwelled on it too much. She‚Äôll reach out when she‚Äôs ready to. If not, then I understand that too. I‚Äôve been in therapy and medication since 2018 and recently sent a cease &amp; desist letter and went no contact with my mother. As a result of that I haven‚Äôt heard from my Dad since it happened. I also live states away from my childhood friends and what‚Äôs left of the family that supports me (not many people). I‚Äôm better off being out of that toxic environment but it‚Äôs still a grief process losing people that are still alive. I have also been grieving what could have been if I only had healthy and supportive parents. I‚Äôm also struggling with my marriage. I‚Äôm a military spouse and it‚Äôs hard being so far away from the little support I have states away (my sisters). I won‚Äôt go into detail here about my rocky marriage but it‚Äôs been traumatic and hard. I haven‚Äôt gotten much support other than therapy and the support my younger sisters have been capable of giving. I‚Äôm in the process of filling out divorce papers and working with an attorneys office to explore my options. I also had surgery at the end of October to repair a hernia. It wasn‚Äôt too big of a deal, and my sisters came from out of town to visit during my recovery, but it did knock me down a bit emotionally because I was restricted from carrying anything over 20 pounds. That meant I couldn‚Äôt hold my toddler who is 30 pounds and that was really hard on both of us. It just would‚Äôve been nice to be able to have hung out and talked to the one friend I have here about everything going on. It honestly would‚Äôve been nice to talk about things that have nothing to do with all of the crap that has gone on this year too. It‚Äôs okay though! Life will carry on and there will be better days. I still got my coffee, got outside, then came home and hung out with my son and put up Christmas decorations. I also got a ton of fantastic advise and support from you lovely folks. Thank you again! TL;DR Thank you for the support and kind words! I‚Äôm not mad at my friend, just sad we couldn‚Äôt meet up. I followed social distancing rules when going out. 2020 has sucked but personally, so has the past decade or so."

It‚Äôs the friends and family you‚Äôve lost because you can‚Äôt explain why. It‚Äôs the opportunities that land in everyone else‚Äôs lap, that they get to grasp with both hands, while yours slip out of your grasp. It‚Äôs the exhaustion that binds your body to your bed. It‚Äôs the hatred and resentment you feel towards yourself, towards the world for being the way it is. It‚Äôs your proven truth that everything and everyone gets better, except for you. It‚Äôs the demon that dragged you down and trapped you in the hellish prison that is your own mind. It‚Äôs the ball and chain locked around your neck, choking the life out of you as you trudge through your marathon, while everyone else gets to charge on ahead, unimpeded. It‚Äôs the wall that blocked you off from life. It's the leech that sucked out everything positive about your life and clouds your memories. It‚Äôs not just being ‚Äúsad‚Äù. And we can only wish it was. *Edited to add: Thank you all for the kind words and awards. I really didn't expect this to blow up as much as it did. I wrote this in an attempt to put my experience with depression into words, and to serve as a reminder of what it feels like, for the times when normal people try to tell me my depression isn't real or otherwise downplay it.*"

    "text": "I'm black, I'm scared, tired and I'm at the end of my rope with life. Jesus, how do I even start. As you could read by the title, I'm a black man. I've always been in the fight. Grew up with racism in all its forms in my country, which, ironically, usually denies there ever being racism in any way. The kind of shit I've heard through my entire life has molded me into someone with no self-esteem, sense of self-worth, voice and made into introvert. Because of the mentality of \"you need to work twice as hard as everyone out there\", I always saw the future as bleak, tiresome and as more struggle. This never really changed. It just got worse with time, with college and the awful reality that came afterwards. I've been depressed for most of my life, with my initial diagnosis at age 9. I still have it, with severe anxiety. My first suicidal thoughts came at age 8, and then and there I already hated myself for everything. For not being enough, for not being what the world wanted, for failing myself at being the best, for never getting anything good out of my own life, for never letting myself rest or be human. And with all the recent events, like the absurd police brutality worldwide, the rise of authoritarianism in my country, with being worked to the bone and around the clock due to the pandemic, with my country quickly moving up to be the worst afflicted by covid-19 and my mom and me being in danger during these times by living in a neighbourhood near a place where a white supremacist parade happened, which also happens to be a place where a lot of people are simply disrespecting quarantine... All of this shit, is just wearing me down really badly. I wake up exhausted. I can't deal with anything without having a serious bout of anxiety or anger outbursts, followed by fullscale breakdowns. I'm feeling guilty by worrying my friends and my mom. I feel guilty by feeling tired, by feeling afraid. I feel guilty by not feeling brave enough to go out on the streets for my people and taking action. I feel guilty for existing. I'm so fucking exhausted and I don't know what to do. I just want it all to end, I just wanna go somewhere else. I can't handle anything anymore. Edit: all of this support... I'm very, very thankful for it. I think I've never felt this supported in my whole life. All of your words have touched me deeply. I'm so glad you helped me. I feel more hopeful, more energized from talking to you all. Thank you. Thank you all, from the bottom of my heart. You've all stopped me from doing something terrible today. Thank you. Edit 2: wow, I was not expecting this kind of response from so many people. I'm trying to respond to everyone, but I think I can't. I'd like to thank you all once more for all your words. I'm very glad that I vented about all these feelings here with you all. I feel so much support from you and I feel like my feelings are valid and worth feeling. It may seem a bit dramatic, but I'm legitimately walking out of this with a different outlook on life. I never expected to see so many people I don't know just rush in to support me when I'm in my absolute worst. So thank you, once more for being here for me. I mean it. I love you all"

Since becoming depressed I've noticed more and more; - an inability to maintain thoughtful conversations with people - severely reduced attention span - short term memory loss - severely reduced motivation I think it largely has to do with my partaking in escapism, as I spend much more time browsing reddit/youtube and getting high since when I actually try to focus on work I usually end up crying. The result seems to be a feeling like I've been living in a haze, like I'm never really fully aware of what's going on, I'm just passively going through the motions of life. Getting out of this rut is going to be so much harder than I thought. I literally feel stupider now that I've been depressed for months.

I didn‚Äôt even move out from my parents house because I was too anxious to stay in a dorm. My ex used to tell me about how much fun they had in high school and how they were in a bunch of clubs and how they had the most fun in college staying in dorms with all their friends and doing fun, dumb stuff. It always destroys me to think about how I missed out on all of that because of something I couldn‚Äôt control. Now I‚Äôm 21 and just graduated college and I‚Äôm lost. I have no friends, no partner, no job, me and my family are on rough terms and I just got diagnosed with anorexia. It is just crushing me and idk what to do anymore.

One of my friends does not understand that people can 100% get depressed because of nothing. She thinks people only get depressed for a specific reason. Such as someone passing away, or a horrible break up. And those things are awful, those feelings are valid and the literal worst. But, she doesn‚Äôt understand that people can just be depressed for basically no reason at all. I‚Äôm currently having a depressive episode. Nothings wrong. I just can‚Äôt get out of bed... I can‚Äôt do the dishes. I can‚Äôt pick up the take-out off my bedroom floor. I can‚Äôt. I just.. I can‚Äôt hear the ‚Äúbut.. why are you depressed?‚Äù question one more time. Fortunately and unfortunately, I‚Äôve been dealing with this illness for long enough that I know that this feeling will end, and I know how to somewhat manage it.

Yesterday it fully made sense to me - if I had had immediate means to end my life I could see taking that action. This is why I can never have a gun, or live in a tall building. So far that small voice in me that says \"It will get better, just wait\" has remained more powerful than the other larger, louder voice that says \"You've always been alone. You'll always be alone.

No alts because fuck it, might dox myself. Picture this, I met a woman. I fell in love. Hopelessly in love. Three years later, she gets pregnant. We were both young, and scared, but I tell myself I will do anything I can to make it work. I have a baby. I cry. I promise MY baby girl the world, and the love I never had. But then things change. The woman lives with her parents, I no longer can stay there with her and her family due to \"covid.\" Okay thats fine. Go to the store? Quarantine for two weeks. Saw someone? Quarantine for two weeks. Quickly realized my opinion is not regarded about the baby. My input has no sway on how to raise her. Suddenly feel like a babysitter, I am \"allowed\" to come over after work, watch the baby, while her mom ignores me. Eventually the woman I fell in love with starts being distant. It's little things at first. She doesn't want to cuddle. She stops kissing me. She stops inviting me to things. Then she tells me she's gay. I decide I can make it work right? I love this woman! She says she wants to be with me still? I'll make it work of course. But then she starts antagonizing me. Insinuating I am a bad father for not being there full time for the baby when I dont have a choice. Ignoring me. Arguing with me. I am... heartbroken. I don't know how else to describe it. I can't help but ask myself if I did something wrong. I keep telling myself I can make this work but it only gets worse. I have recently fallen into the worst depression of my life. I have had a couple suicide attempts in the past, the only thing stopping me now is knowing I would be leaving my baby girl without a father. I dont know what to do. I donf know what this post was to accomplish. Maybe to rant? Get this off my chest? Who knows. I sure don't. Edit: I barely remembered making this post.

And I often got told that if I have these, I need to think very positively about myself and realise that these thoughts aren't true. But it never worked, my negativity is way too strong to be able to habe any positive thoughts about myself, let alone to have stronger positive than negative thoughts. So my current therapist suggested another approach. She said, instead of forcing myself to think positive, I should try to not evaluate myself at all for a certrain time. Neither negatively nor positively (though the second is rather rare anyway). What this does is that it gives some distance to the negative thoughts and therefore breaks that cycle of depression where depression makes me have negative thoughts and the negative thoughts make me depressed. This is way easier because I just have to be neutral instead of positive and I notice what she means with breaking the cycle. I hope that this might help someone here. Edit: I don't know what to say right now... Last time I looked at my phone this had 10 upvoted and I was so happy that 10 people considered this useful and now I see this...

    "text": "My friend attempted suicide a couple days ago. My family is saying I will \"ruin Christmas\" if I spend time with her in the hospital on Christmas Eve instead of visiting them. What can I do? A good friend of mine with whom I've been attending therapy for BPD overdosed a couple days ago. She survived and was transported unconscious to the hospital. She woke up but is unsurprisingly devastated. I want to be there as her support, she has a boyfriend but no family members who care about her and few friends. I had plans to see my family for Christmas but when this happened, it left me deeply depressed, particularly because another good friend of mine had committed suicide four years ago almost on the same day. To elaborate, I don't like spending Christmas with my family. I like them, but Christmas has always been more about chores and preparations than about quiet and peace. I thought I would spend Christmas by visiting my friend in the hospital. I don't want her to be alone, I know that if I were in her situation I would appreciate it if someone came to visit me. So I proposed this to my mother and brother, even the possibility that I would spend the afternoon with her and then go down to see them before dinner. However, their comments left gasping for air. They showed little empathy for my friend or me. My mother asked me if I had any \"normal\" friends. My brother told me that while it's ultimately my choice, I would be ruining Christmas by not coming down, or even by coming down just for dinner, that everyone would be disappointed in me and it would create arguments, implying I would be at fault for them. Here's the breakdown: with my family, I risk being ostracized for weeks if not months if I don't go down there. However, I've felt more and more like they were less and less my family, while I've felt like my friends have shown more compassion and empathy for my depression and BPD than my family ever has - in fact, they've dismissed it as me \"not having enough social activity\", as \"not having enough will\", and have called my therapy \"a waste of time.\" I feel like visiting my friend is the right thing to do, I know I will think of her the whole time I would be down at my family's, but I do not want to be ostrasized for months. I don't think I could handle it with my mental condition. Any and all thoughts are welcome. Thank you."

    "text": "I‚Äôm 19, my girlfriend was murdered, the trial is soon and I‚Äôm getting more and more depressive Hi y‚Äôall, Well I'm not used to posting on forums but I feel so bad atm and I can't open up about this to my family, my friends or my therapist even if they want that, I feel completely unable to talk about it with them. I‚Äôm a 20yo man. I‚Äòm Irish but my family moved to France when I was 5 and that is where I have lived since. I grew up in a small country village, the school had only two classes. I hardly spoke French but I got a friend very quickly, I‚Äôll call her Honey in this post. So Honey and I were friends all our childhood, we were in the same class every year and we were also neighbors so we played together every day after school. Year after year I became bilingual in French and made lots of friends, but I started to have a crush on her. When I was 11 we started middle school, we were still in the same class and all our classmates were trying to get us together, but we were pretty shy at that time so we didn't dare to ¬´ flirt ¬ª. Finally it was the following year, when I was 12 years old, that we got in relationship. Ofc the feelings I had for her weren‚Äôt as strong as those I had for her when we grew up up because we were still young but I was so happy. She was the first girl I kissed, the only one actually. We kept growing up, we were always in the same class every year and we kept spending all of our time together. If I explain that, it‚Äôs so that you understand that from my 5 to 19 years I almost spent every day of my life with her, she gradually became as essential as breathing for me. The more the years went by, the more ¬´ serious ¬ª (important to each of us) our relationship became. We never argue, ofc sometimes we didn‚Äôt agree with each other but we knew how to put our differences aside and respect the point of view of the other. Then when I was 15 we started high school, at that time we were in a relationship for almost three years and people were amazed by the longevity of our couple, because at that age it‚Äôs unusual. But we loved each other so much (and I still love her so much), it was like I had found the perfect person to me and I don't want to speak for her but I felt like I was perfect to her. We kept growing up, we did our first time together (and all the others, I never had sex with another girl). We wrote long love letters to each other, any pretext was good to say how much we loved each other. I mean, I'm kinda that clich√© of the chunk rugby player, people don't really imagine me doing that, yet for her I‚Äòd have done anything and everything, she was so exceptional, I felt incredibly privileged to be part of her life. We graduated high school and that summer we moved into our apartment, then started university. I was so glad to live with her, to sleep with her every night. Of course our parents let us sleep together on weekends and holidays but it wasn‚Äôt the same, it was a new step in our relationship and we were so happy. When I explained to my new mates from the university that I had been with my girlfriend for 6 years they were stunned, they asked me if I had never wanted to flirt with another girl or anything and the answer has always been no : since my childhood, I grew up alongside this exceptional girl and I always dreamed of being with her and I felt so lucky to be in a relationship with, I never even noticed any other girl. I found her perfect in every way. We were so happy. I just want to tell you a little bit about the great person she was. She was so heart warmed, she couldn‚Äôt stand injustice. She always wanted to help others. She was so kind and caring. Whenever our friends needed advice or support for something she was the one they call, she was full of wisdom and good intentions. She was always smiling, she illuminated people's lives with her presence. She was a very funny person as well. She always saw the bright side of everything, she was so positive. She never gave up, she worked hard to reach her goals. She was so clever, I‚Äôd even say brilliant, she was a very gifted student. She was passionate : when she did something she put her whole heart into it. She made people feeling special, she knew how to bring out the best in them. She always complimented everyone, she was adorable. She was also sensitive, she hated seeing the ugly things of the world, she could cry for that. But she was also someone who made the world more beautiful by her mere presence. I‚Äôve never met someone so selfless and altruistic. She was also incredibly beautiful, the most beautiful woman I‚Äôve ever seen. She was an angel, for her friends, for her family, for me, for my family who loved her too. My mam has three sons and she was used to say that Honey was like her daughter. My little brother was kinda an hooligan when he was younger and listened neither to my parents nor to me. She spent so much time helping him, because of her he really took control of his life again. Everyone loved her, literally. She was wonderful. She was someone who loved to pamper people. She could spend weeks making a gift or a surprise for someone, but she was always embarrassed when someone gived a gift to her. I think she was one of the few people who was sincere when they said they preferred to give than to receive. I felt so good with her, she was the love of my life, literally. I always wondered how she could love me so much, I mean I‚Äòm not that bad and I always did my best especially for her but she was so much better than me. And yet she still looked at me like I was one of the wonder of the world. We were so happy. I was only 19 years old and yet I saw my life with her and she saw her life with me, we had lots of plans. And even beyond me, she was a great person, who was so young and had her life ahead of her. I mean, if we had broken up, it‚Äôd have been incredibly hard but at least she would have kept existing, living, shining as she deserved. But I cannot bear what happened. We were together, so happy and in love, I never could have believed that she will disappear so quickly and in such a brutal way. No one deserves that and when it happens to someone so close to you, someone you love so much, it‚Äôs extremely harsh. It was a Sunday and we were at our parents‚Äô for the weekend. Sometimes on weekends we slept together and sometimes we slept on our own and we just spent the day together. On Saturday evening we slept each on our own, her at her parents‚Äô and me at mine, there wasn‚Äôt even a particular reason. On Sunday morning she wanted to run for an hour and offered me but I was lazy. I was tired, I wanted to stay in bed an hour more. It‚Äôs absurd : I was studying sports science and I was too lazy to go running. I‚Äòd never forgive myself. It‚Äôs an ongoing case so I‚Äôm not allowed to speak in detail about it and anyway it doesn‚Äôt have to be, but she was violently assaulted and tortured and died, and then her body was burned. Suspects were arrested a few weeks later, it was in Feb 2019 and the trial was supposed to be in May 2020 but it was postponed because of the coronavirus (France is in quarantine). I cannot even describe the infinite pain I felt when a few days after his disappearance, while very important research was being carried out, her body was finally found and we knew what had happened to her, I had a blackout. Since I woke up from this fading away I have been taking heavy psychotropes, that doesn‚Äôt prevent me from constantly having anxiety attacks and having to take a fuck ton of sleeping pills to sleep, otherwise I have awful nightmares. I never thought I‚Äòll fall so low one day, I have always been someone very happy and full-blown. But I never thought that the love of my life was going to be murdered one day either. I haven't been going to university since, I don't do anything except think about her all day, I saw a lot of therapist but they only say shit, how am I supposed to accept the sudden death of the person I love the most in the world and with whom I grew up believing that we were going to spend our lives together ? They tell me about the emotions of mourning but the only emotions I have are deep feelings of hopelessness and hatred towards those who did this. I feel even worse since I know who did this and what their \"reasons\" were, because they were people I knew. I feel devastated. Sometimes I want to kill myself and sometimes I want to avenge her by killing them. But I feel unable to inflict this pain on my parents, who are very friends with Honey's parents (They had been friends for a long time before, because we are neighbors) and who help them a lot to hold on since it happened, I can see that they have the fear is that I kill myself and to be in the same state as the parents of Honey. Her parents are suffering so much, they lost their only daughter and I don't know what to do to relieve their pain. Whenever I speak with them they seem so happy all of a sudden, they say that Honey kept living through me. But imo it's not true, she no longer lives and will never lives again and I miss her so, so much. But I know if they say that it‚Äôs because they miss her so much too. She is missed by everyone who knew her, she was so wonderful. And I will always miss her. People tell me that one day when I‚Äôll be happy again and I‚Äòll meet someone else and go back to normal life. But I know it‚Äôs wrong, first I‚Äòll never be happy again, how am I supposed to live without her after growing up with her ? She was as essential to me as breathing, it‚Äôs unbearable to survive since she‚Äòs no longer there, how can I resume a normal life ? And how can I meet someone else ? I never wanted when I was happy and she was there to meet someone else so it isn‚Äôt now that I‚Äòm desperate without her that I‚Äòll want to meet someone, plus she is irreplaceable. I feel devastated. She is the only one I want and yet I know she‚Äòll never come back. I constantly think of her, of her laughter, her smile, her scent. I bought her perfume and I spray it on my pillow every day, I know it's stupid but it's the only thing that helps me sleep a little better. I just wanna hug her again. Sometimes when people lose a loved one they say they regret not telling them how much they mean to them and at least I‚Äôm ¬´ relieved ¬ª that Honey knew how much I loved her and how important she was to me when she passed away, because I told her every day. Just before the quarantine there was a commemoration for the one year of her death and everyone looked at me with pity. As I no longer go to class, in rugby or to see my friends I don‚Äôt see anyone and I had not seen some people for several months, they were dazed by my appearance. And I hadn't realized but actually I became the shadow of myself, I always was very ¬´ strong ¬ª and now I‚Äòm extremely bony. It depressed me even more to see how many people seemed concerned when they saw me. That's why I avoid my friends, they don't know what to say (and I understand that's normal, in their place I wouldn't know what to say either) and they‚Äòre also embarrassed not to know what to tell me. The only person I used to open up to is Honey, and now having to deal with such difficult emotions without knowing to who open up is very painful. My family is trying to support me as much as they can but it's very hard, there was a very bad atmosphere at home, so much so that my parents broke up and my father went back to Ireland with my older brother. I feel like my mom and little brother don't know what to do with me anymore. But I don't know what to do with me either. I think that after the trial I‚Äòll go to Ireland for a while as well, just to take a break, here every time I go out everyone is aware of what happened, throughout the region (and even outside, but here they recognize me so they look at me with that pitying air that depresses me even more). I‚Äôm not afraid of the judgement, I know they‚Äòll have a long sentence but I‚Äòm very afraid of the trial in itself and to, during a week or two to, hear what she has been through in detail all day, to see her murderers and to hear what they‚Äòre going to say, I‚Äòm anxious I cannot bear it. For the moment I‚Äôm trying not to think about it. I spend all my time in the tree hut that his father built between our gardens when we were younger. We spent all our time there, when we were teenagers and our parents didn‚Äôt want us to sleep together we secretly met there and stayed all night. Everything remained as it‚Äôs, when I‚Äôm there I feel calmer. I feel like nothing can ever ease my pain, I don't even know why I came to tell my story here. I just needed to open up and I can't do it with my loved one. I don‚Äôt think anyone will have read this anyway."

Got into a conversation with my wife yesterday and I mentioned ‚Äúif I were to be in a place where I could just sit still and not have my brain worry about something, I don‚Äôt know what I would do with myself.‚Äù Anyway, I don‚Äôt get into depressive moods too often anymore, it this morning, 3 days before our 5th anniversary vacation (we never take vacations. Never have the money.) I check my bank account and realize that all of the bills I had planned to come out last week all hit at once and put our account into the negative. By quite a bit. I panicked. My wife had been looking forward to a small trip to Chattanooga to just relax for MONTHS. The kid was to stay at my parents house and we were just going to relax for a few days. When I realized I messed up the timing on our bills, I spiraled. I absolutely lost control and cried. Lost it. It was probably the worst I have ever felt. I was crying for about 10 minutes when I suddenly had this sense of calm wash over me. Suicide. Easy. I got out of bed, suddenly stoped crying, cleaned my face up and began getting dressed. I told my wife I was going out for a little while. She knew something was going on and refused to let me leave the house. She physically grabbed me, made me look her in the eyes and told me everything was fine. It brought me out of my head. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs something that I would have gone through with, but in that moment it was the most ok I had ever been with the idea of suicide. We still don‚Äôt have the money for the trip, but that‚Äôs ok. I know I have someone looking out for me. Sorry for the rambling, but I figured I just needed to get it out of my head."

    "text": "I‚Äôm killing myself [update] So most of you probably didn‚Äôt even see my post before, which is fine, obviously, but I just felt the need to put this update out for the ones who did. 3 days ago I was so close to taking my own life. I was going to jump off a bridge and end it all. I was drunk so it made matters only worse. As I sat there and thought to myself, a voice came in my head. This voice told me how this was the wrong thing to do, that I have so much more going for me, and I can‚Äôt lose my life over some girl. So here I am, 3 days later. The girl and i have discussed what our relationship is going to be like. We are on a break as this is a time for me to focus and make myself happy. My happiness can‚Äôt be dependent on another person. That is unhealthy. I‚Äôve started seeing a counselor and just doing more & staying active. I know In the end I can conquer these demons. I would just like to say thank you to all of you who reached out to me that night. I obviously didn‚Äôt respond, but knowing that a random stranger online cares enough about another stranger to make sure they‚Äôre okay, well that is special to me. Thank you once again, and I hope every one in this sub finds some sort of happiness in their life. We all deserve it. This is a disease just like diabetes, and you should not be ashamed of it. Instead face it head on, and say ‚Äúfuck you depression, I‚Äôm better than you.‚Äù"

I usually decline social events when I'm really depressed because who would want to be around a depressed person, right? So, I'll stay home by myself, which makes me feel even more isolated and down. But it's not that I don't want to be around people. I just don't want to pretend all night that I'm this other person -- I do that all day at work; it's exhausting. But to have a good friend come over and just be there, just sit with you while you watch Tv, it just makes me feel loved, which helps chip away at the sadness just a little bit."

Well, I've gotten really good at making myself do things. I make myself do my job. I make myself do a side hustle. I make myself read books and post about them on my blog. This month, I'm making myself do NaNoWriMo. I presume the idea is that, at some point, you start enjoying things again, but I haven't ever managed to get to that stage. I dread my side hustle. I never know what to say about books until I start writing. I write exactly the number of words I need to hit my goal and then I stop. I don't enjoy any of it. Some of it, I really hate. And I've been doing the side hustle for a year and five months, and the blog for two years, so it's not a matter of it 'give it time'. &#x200B; I don't know how to make myself do things if I don't treat them as obligations. Anything optional, I just don't do. It feels like a vicious cycle where the only way to make myself do something also makes me hate it! Is there a way around this? Has anyone else felt this? I can't seem to find anything online that even mentions this being a problem, let alone actually proposing a solution. &#x200B; I'm trying to make myself go for a walk every day, because that's supposed to be good for your mood, and it feels like an actual punishment."

    "text": "Having wonderful, loving, supportive family doesn‚Äôt make you any less depressed. I have two extremely loving parents, a supportive sister, and a handful of close friends who I know would always listen if I needed it. I am still extremely depressed and ready to end it all. I attempted suicide 4 years ago, ended up in the psych ward for 2 weeks, and my family and friends visited every day. I can barely function anymore. I try so incredibly hard every day to be normal, to work, walk, chat, and appear fine. Mentally, I am thinking about killing myself for hours every day. Today I lost it, blew off work, and slept the entire day. I cried to my mother and she cried with me. Asked me what I needed, willing to do anything, but it doesn‚Äôt help. There isn‚Äôt anything wrong with me. I‚Äôm young, pretty, thin, and am capable of making friends and keeping them. I have a STEM degree, I‚Äôve had committed relationships. None of that makes me happy. The true tragedy of my life is that I know I could do more, be more, and I just cant. I‚Äôve been told I am strong because I haven‚Äôt done drugs or drank, because I powered through my degree, because I haven‚Äôt killed myself. I‚Äôm not strong, I‚Äôm guilted. Having a family who loves you and you love is a double edged sword. Love doesn‚Äôt cure depression. It does wrack you with guilt if you even think of attempting it. It would destroy my family. I‚Äôm not exaggerating. They have all told me individually, may times, that it would. My parents would never forgive themselves. I would haunt them forever. I tried therapy. After I got out of the hospital I was on anti-depressants. I tried different meds, I saw 4 different therapists. It all just made it so much worse. One of my therapists almost got me involuntarily recommitted to the hospital. Her talking to my parents and ensuring they would be picking me up and taking me home was the only thing that saved me. Even the ‚Äúgood‚Äù therapists just made me feel worse. I would leave every appointment more depressed than I came in. I quit trying that after a year. The thing about therapy is that you are forced to lie. I was suicidal but couldn‚Äôt talk about it. If they suspect anything you get the cops called on you and they forces you into the prison that is the psych ward. They force medication on you, get you fired from your job, and destroy whatever remnants of a life you had. My mother is a certified grief councillor. She volunteers in hospice and regularly supports grieving people. She can‚Äôt help me. Talking to her is pointless. She will cry and beg me not to. It doesn‚Äôt make me feel better, just guilty. All this rambling because the truth is that I am without hope. My family is dragging me through life. All the love in the world and it doesn‚Äôt make a fucking difference. Drugs, therapy, doesn‚Äôt matter. Depression is a death sentence and there is no cure. My only hope is to distance myself from them and one day just do it. Push them far enough away that they grieve me and move on. That way, killing myself won‚Äôt affect anyone. Edit: thank you to people who are commenting. I am having a hard time finding words to reply to people. I dont really express myself easily. I really appreciate everyone here. Its nice to feel understood."

I laugh at them. Theyre funny. I see myself in them. And then for hours and days upon days I lock myself in my car with a vague numbness, ditching class or calling off work to just... what, stare off into a void and roll around uncomfortably in my drivers seat in a shitty parking lot, chew through a pack of cigarettes, and just try to settle down suicidal compulsions. I stare in the rearview mirror and gastation bathrooms for forty minutes trying to make sense of who's looking back and why the sight of that person makes my stomach churn. I don't sleep for days on end until I collapse. I lose weight in 7 pound intervals. The thoughts of being a fuck-up and how bad I would beat the shit out of myself if I met myself on the street just stew any time Im beside myself. It's so funny! So quirky and relatable! If this is relatable that's fucking tragic. Being a ball of despondency and wanting to break my bones with a baseball bat is something I want everyone to laugh at with me.

In a moment of panic I slammed the door... right onto his head. Everyone in my family is telling me ‚Äúit‚Äôs not your fault‚Äù and ‚Äúit was a mistake‚Äù, but guess who always fucking makes mistakes? ME. And now my mistakes are causing the deaths of those I love. I hate myself so much I don‚Äôt even see the point of going on anymore. Edit: Oh my god, thank you everyone! It‚Äôs been a really hard day and the support I‚Äôve had from my family and you guys has helped a lot. It‚Äôs still an on going process, but I‚Äôm trying not to blame myself for it. Hearing your stories actually helped a lot, it let me know I wasn‚Äôt alone in this and that it is possible to move on. Thanks guys :)"

I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs something physically wrong with me or if it‚Äôs just stress related, but for about 2 years now, I feel as if my cognitive abilities have been worsening. I can barely hold a conversation anymore. When I do talk, I stutter/stammer/mispronounce words. My mind blanks out a lot and my attention span is nonexistent. I used to be a really smart kid. Performed very well on the SAT despite having awful grades due to feeling indifferent about school. Then after high school, I became a full blown hypochondriac along with having generalized/social anxiety as well. 2 years ago I felt like I was THE man, and today I feel like an incompetent moron who becomes less functional each day. I think I‚Äôm recovering from my anxiety disorders, but I sometimes wonder if I‚Äôm actually just normalizing them, causing the illusion of recovery. I don‚Äôt know where to go. I‚Äôve really been trying to get better but I feel like I go two steps forward and three steps back. Can anyone else relate to this? Currently typing this out standing in the shower, feeling pretty down right now. EDIT: ironically enough, I forgot to mention that my memory is complete shit now. My long term memory isn‚Äôt bad but holy shit, I‚Äôll forget what you said in a conversation 10 seconds after it‚Äôs said."

Trying get help. I don't want it anymore. I'm miserable and slowly becoming crazy but I don't think I'm even trying to fix it anymore. I've accepted it.

I had no choice in my birth and I don't have a choice really in my death either. I mean I could off myself but no one would really respect my choice. I don't know, I don't get much joy out of life. I never really had much of a chance to, I get some but I don't know if it's worth going on and on forever. I hate all of the obligations there are to stay alive. I stay alive mostly for other people, I know that's important. I wish I could be selfish and die. I used to think growing up that once my parents both died I'd just kill myself too, I feel like that might still be a good plan for me. I have goals and desires, as well as things I want to do. But I also don't really enjoy life. This is all selfish I'm aware. Perhaps it's wrong of me to think this way but I feel resentment towards my existence. Resentment towards the obligations and feelings I hold towards others. Resentment of my love for them and their love for me. I daydream about becoming a major asshole to everyone, just so I can off myself and have people celebrate my death. But I also can't bring myself to be a jerk."

    "text": "Perhaps what's worse than depression is not being able to realize if you're having the best time of your life or the worst because it all feels the same. I'm having a really hard time keeping up with life, especially since the lockdown started. I just don't feel like I have anything to live for. I *do not* want to be happy. I just don't understand what happiness is to be completely honest. That is not to say that I'm unhappy and miserable, what I'm saying is that happiness and sadness has become the same thing for me. I just can't separate the two. On top of that, there's this feeling of guilt I keep having about everything. I *am* from a rich family, people have always expected me to be on top of everything ever since I learned to walk, but I was never able to be on top. I've always sucked at everything. I tried to be on top, but never made it. And so now I'm this 21 year old uni student. And I've been hammered so much with that mindset of trying to get to be best at everything, and since I've always failed at that, I feel safer as a failure. I just *do not* feel that I want to succeed. I've become an emotional masochist. Sometimes I imagine that a loved one would come and choke me to death to put me out of this misery and leave me in a cold dead end where no one would ever come across again. That's not to say I'm suicidal. I am *not*. I just like having those kinds of imaginations. The only thing I do to keep my mind off of these feelings these days is that I listen to music. Even my genres are New Age, or shoegazing or doom metal, which used to be uplifting epic music. Now I'm not going too much into that stuff, but I hope I've made my point clear. I'm not looking for concrete advice. Perhaps simply writing these down and sharing might help me a lot. Thank you for taking the time to read through this whole post. I truly appreciate it."

What are some things I can do to alleviate my depression? The title and this story may sound fake (New account to hopefully protect my identity), but I swear to you it could not be more real for me. I wanted to share this, I am not doing this for attention but merely to seek help. More questions will be asked at the end of my story. As the title describes, a miracle has occurred given the severity and intent of the crash. The paramedics, police, doctors, nurses and my parents all gave me the most puzzled look of their lives when they asked how fast I was going, and I replied \"200 km/h\". I have been depressed for 4 years now. Nothing has been working and my mental health has declined terribly. I have been on multiple medications, tried behavioural therapy such as cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), and even went a course of Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). First my motivation to do anything went down; I couldn't eat, do school work and most importantly, socialize. My social circle grew smaller as my depression grew bigger, after 4 years of suffering as well as other health conditions such as horrible eyesight (+10.00 in each eye with astigmatism), sleep apnea and anxiety, I figured life wasn't going to get any better and I decided to end my life. I drove to the mountains where I decided I would find a large hill, go full speed down it and either turn into the median or drive off the road, ultimately killing myself. About 3 hours from my hometown I found the perfect hill, The road was steep, perfect for gaining speed to ensure a fatal crash. Without thinking too much (I would just talk myself out and not commit), I pulled a U-turn and drove to the hill which was about 5 minutes after that point. They say your life flashes before your eyes, mine played back to me for those 5 minutes. The most important people and influential moments of my life appeared before my eyes. They suddenly disappeared as I approached my chosen hill. My foot automatically floored the gas pedal, I placed my left foot behind the brake so I wouldn't back out. I raced down the hill, gaining more and more speed, by the time I reached the bottom, my car (which only has a speedometer for up to 200 km/h. I saw the road start to bend and I jerked my wheel into the opposite direction of the turn, slamming the front end of the car into the median. That was the last thing I remembered before waking up in my car, with tapping on the window from bystanders. All I could think to myself at that moment was \"wow, I so much of a failure I can't even kill myself\". A bystander described to the paramedics and police that I hit the median, did about 10 spins (no flips) and then continued to scrape median down the hill for another 250m. I got a glimpse of my car before I was taken away in an ambulance, it was completely destroyed. When I arrived to the hospital I was placed in the trauma room however, the doctor was incredibly surprised after seeing me sitting upright with consciousness after a 200 km/h car accident. He assessed me and ordered a full-body CT scan. The results came back clean, no bleeding, no broken bones and most importantly, no death. He then admitted me to the psychiatry ward (which I won't get into on this post but it was a nightmare!!!). The everyone's surprise I was barely injured, walking away with a concussion with memory loss at most. This phrase really stuck in my mind because nearly every person I have talked to so far has said: \"It's a miracle you're alive\". I'm not religious, but I agree, it is a miracle I'm alive, and I\"m not going to waste it. I'm begging for help because I know this community loves to help people when they reach out. I really want to try and beat my depression but I don't know how. I have tried CBT, I'm going BACK to ECT for another round of treatment and I'm on increased medication. I will be seeing counsellors and psychiatrists, however thanks to Canadian healthcare not until 2020 (which is one of the reasons I decided to end it, due to lack of resources). If anyone out there has any tips on how to manage severe depression and anxiety please let me know. I'm still alive today despite the severity of the crash, and I believe it's a sign that I need to conquer this depression and do something great with my life. I am tired of laying at home, with no energy and no motivation, wasting away my life every day with my depression. I can personally say even those who are suiciding don't want to die, they merely just want to stop existing. Please help with any advice you have, I'm begging for my life to change, please. I am trying my best to push past my depression and suicidal thinking so I can give life another try. Here are a list of specific questions that would benefit a lot: \\-How do I keep up my motivation despite having no energy all the time? \\-How can I keep up or have more energy? \\-I'm thinking of going back to school for Nursing, my current position (lab tech) doesn't feel fulfilling and I'm looking for something more. Is nursing school a good idea or will that just make my life more stressful?) \\-What are some habits I could do to alleviate my depression \\-Any secret self-help/feel good tips? \\-How do I make more friends and build a better support network? \\-What do I tell to my friends who have noticed I just \"disappeared\" for a few days? &#x200B; Thanks to those who took the time to read this post, I usually get little to no reads on Reddit but I thought I'd share this anyway since not many people can say they survived a 200 km/h automobile suicide attempt and walked out with minor injuries. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask. Edit: more questions Edit 2: Thank you, everyone, for taking the time to write to me. I truly didn't believe this would reach this many people. I will try and reply/read everyones post but I am still in the process of seeing a lot of specialists. But I am truly grateful for all the love and support that has been sent my way. Thank you, I will make you all proud and try my best to implement all of the tips into my life."

My depression mainly comes from a place of self-loathing and my own inability to accept myself. I have people who I care about and who care about me but I feel like depression has manifested into my personality and it is a part of who I am now.

I literally cannot remember a time in my life where I wasn't angry or unhappy with myself or how people treated me. I've had body issues since I was 8 years old because my grandparents overfed me and let me eat sweets all day, which led to me being outcasted by my peers and constantly criticised by my parents. I first started thinking about suicide when I was maybe 12 or 13 and 10 years later I still think about it. I don't think I've ever has a solid year of my life where I've thought that everything was going to be okay and life was worth living. I've had months of temporary relief from the constant pain, but thats all they were; temporary. I thought finding someone to spend my life with and who loves me unconditionally and puts up with my suicidal tantrums would fix me but it hasn't. I thought effectively curing my disfiguring autoimmune disease would help me have a new lease on life, but it hasn't. I have lots of friends, an attractive face, and I had a job I liked. No body in my personal life except for two people know that I struggle, and the rest would never guess it. I have nothing to be sad about, really, I have an objectively easy life. But that doesn't matter, I am depressed and I always will be. I could have the perfect body, my dream job, have millions in my bank account and I'd still feel exhausted. In the same way that people say 'once an addict, always an addict', I've come to believe the same thing about my depression."

A day of not replying to a message can become a week when you don't know how to explain that you just couldn't be around people that day, which can become a month when it always seems impossible to reach out and explain where you've been. Edit: I've gone through each and everyone's reply. And I have only one thing to tell you all; thank you for listening to me! Thank you for all the kind words! and the gold really made my day :)"

After years of trauma and abuse, however, depression completely overcame my life, and after so long, I feel it has utterly destroyed my brain; fried it, like an overloaded computer. I genuinely forget how old I am sometimes. I struggle doing basic math. My short-term memory has deteriorated to nothing. Etc. I just feel as though I'm slowing down only more each passing day.

Edit (05/24/2020): I did read all the comments, thank you. This thought of regrets have tortured me so much: a simple choice a decade ago still haunts me today and looms over me. In the past two weeks, wrestling my inner demons, I lost so much weight and have lost so much mental curiosity and interest I used to possess. But recently, after watching Being Erica as some of you recommended, I realized that \"no matter where you run, you just end up running into yourself.\" I suppose regrets will come in different forms, no matter what I do or try, the outcome would be the same that I'd be short of what I desire to be. To be honest, I don't know what a solution could be here, but I suppose seeking it is part of that endless struggle."

Not a thing has happened I should've cared about missing. My life has only gotten so so much worse. Now I WISH I felt how I did when I first felt suicidal. That was roses compared to this shit and I actively wanted to die then too. My life has gotten so much more fucked up than i could've ever thought then, and I really only would've missed out on suffering. I've only been alive because 1. Suicide is way harder than people think and 2. I'm supposed to and guess what? I'm not thankful for it. Jesus Christ do I wish I had just killed myself 8 years ago or *any* time since.

    "text": "I'm a 13 year old boy who is abused and need help I'm 13 years old and I live with my dad. I'm shared custody from my mom to my dad. My dad is very abusive towards me. I've been diagnosed with depression and PTSD and I've gone to the hospital twice over suicide attempts because every time I'm with my dad I want to kill myself. He pushes me to the limit and I'm afraid that. Ever since I was little, my dad has always beaten me with a belt. Even before I was old enough for school. My dad has beaten me for not doing what I was told to do. He yells curse words at me and uses my mother as an example of what not to be. And that makes me feel sad because I miss my mom. Recently, my grades dropped. I've been having problems at school. I have a hard time focusing and paying attention to what I'm being taught. My dad was pissed. One moment he‚Äôs screaming at me and cursing me out and telling me I won't achieve anything in life. And telling me I'm going to regret it when he‚Äôs done with me. My 11 year old brother also made a bad grade, so he walked into my brothers room and I heard screaming and loud sound from my dad hitting him with a belt. Then he walked up to me and told me to give him my hand. I held my hand out and he hit me extremely hard with the belt. I screamed and held my hand, but he told me to hold my hand out again he continue to do it over and over again. Then he told both of us to come in the kitchen. He started yelling at us saying he was in an \"ass whooping mood\" and that he'd beat us whenever we felt like it. That if we didn't care about our grades he wouldn't care either. That he'd make us feel his pain. He hit me extremely hard. My hand was red and swollen. I had a bruise on my wrist that was slightly swollen and stung to the touch. He told me to hurry and wash the dishes before he'd do it again. And he did. But my hand hurt too badly. He threatened to hold me down. I'm going to kill myself if I have to continue to live with him. I cannot take this anymore and no one will do anything about it, I decided that when I go back to my mom's on Sunday I am refusing to go back to my dad's. This is what it's come to because he refuses to cooperate and my mom doesn't have enough money to get a lawyer and free legal aid takes too long. So I am not going. I know my dad will call the police if I don't go. When they come, I will talk to them and tell them my situation. Can they force me to go? What will they do? Because in order to get me to go they would have to physically drag me. I am in fear of my life and I don't want to die but he just pushes me to that limit so I just can't be around him. I don't know how many times I've tried to tell my dad this and even my therapists have tried to tell him this. He doesn't care, he simply denies treating me the way he does saying he's never called me the things he does on a daily basis like dumbass, idiot, son of a b\\*\\*\\*, and he even calls my brother those things and denies it. Then when we're in public or around other people he acts like a totally sweet person, and his girlfriend thinks that I'm the problem because he constantly complains about me when really it's just a big show. What will the cops do about it when they come?"

Weed. I feel so young (because I havent literally done much at all with my depression+anxiety) but ancient at the same time. I have no passions, no interests. No goals. Havent had good friends in years. Virgin. I dont go out. I dont take photos, I dont use social media. I feel like I dont exist. I dont even have a fucking job now. Never had a boyfriend. Literally the only thing Ive done is graduate university and I cant even get a fucking job. Ive struggled in everything ive ever done. School. Hobbies. Uni. Work. Job Applications. Appearance. The only time ive ever been hit on is at clubs. I just hate seeing other people my age succeed and do well in life. Even people who are 17-18, have had more experiences then me. I hardly go out. Ive spent 90% of time at home alone with my elderly parents. I try so hard, but Im still a loser and I hate it. Im not introverted and I just hate how my life has become. I hate it..I do. I feel like I must be such damaged goods that its too late to get better. These last 6 years in particular have flown and Im just so fucking done. Its not like Ive tried. For 2 years Ive tried joining groups, volunteering etc to improve my situation but i get nowhere. No one wants a bar of me.

I don't want to hear that my problems aren't a big deal while you stand there with your success stories and your dating histories and your loving partners. I don't want to hear your stories about how you found your SOs when this is specifically a major part of what's wrong with me; literally a simple \"this is what helped me\" would be nice, not trying to make me feel worse. I don't want to hear the same bullshit about loving myself. I barely even have the energy to write well. I want to vent about how much I hate myself. How FUCKED UP I am. I've lost 10 years, maybe more than that to porn addiction. I don't know if I walked in on my parents or if I was exposed to sexuality at a young age. But I've been masturbating since long before I even hit puberty. And then I discovered porn. Which leads me to now. A porn addict trying to break his habits by only masturbating 3 days a week... and then that's only turned into masturbating *multiple* times a day. It's fucked my relationships up. I can make friends, guys call me cool and women call me sweet. But I just... I'm too scared to escalate sexually and romantically. I can't stand up for myself so people walk over me. I'm afraid of taking risks. I'm a virgin at almost 23. I do not have a car, can't even drive. Never held down a job. Trying to lose weight but making no progress. Never been to a bar. Only been to one party. Never hooked up. Never had a relationship. The only things I have going for me are my writing and my drawing, and even then I'm losing interest in those as well. I don't blame women. I don't blame men either. It all lies with me. My family isn't any better. I've tried talking about this to them multiple times. I can predict exactly what they say: \"this too shall pass\", \"believe what you want to believe\" \"if you believe it won't happen, it won't.\" Yeah, great. Thanks for the \"help.\" And then there's the verbal abuse from my narcissistic shrew of a mother and the complete apathy of my father, who constantly tells me he'll have my back but never seems to step up when I truly need him... but he IS happy to yell at and threaten me every time I try standing up for myself against my mother. Every time I try to leave, they threaten to call the cops. I have nowhere to go, no source of income. I am a fucked up, broken, weird piece of trash who drags the few people who care for him down with his negativity. They're better than me, none of them deserve me. I feel this void in the center of my stomach and heart wherever I go, and now that I've spent all day reading through reddit (seriously, every time these moments of depression happen, ***EVERY*** post I see has to be about sex and dating and relationships), I feel even worse. So much worse than yesterday. I can't forgive myself for the thing's I've done in the past. I sabotage myself every single time. In my worst moments I have these thoughts, these fucking FANTASIES of tying a wire to my neck and the other end to a car, and then letting the wire hang me and hopefully cutting my head off. All I do is exist. I can't live like this. Normally I don't feel suicidal. But now the thoughts are coming back. Wanna know the funny thing? If I die, people will just go \"that sucks, pass the apple juice\", chalk me up to a statistic, and forget. Because nobody gives a shit about worthless men who can't keep up with the rest of them. I don't even know why I wrote this. Nobody is going to notice or care. People rarely do anyways. **EDIT: I'm seeing a therapist online.** **EDIT 2: I can't say I'm feeling better than I was yesterday when I posted this, but... a Platinum, a Gold, Silvers, so many kind comments...

I wasn't expecting this to get so much traction, and I'm so close to crying at seeing so many people reach out and...** ***care***. **I'll try and respond to everyone when I can. Just... thank you, everyone. For helping me feel a bit less alone.** **EDIT 3: Well... I don't know what to say. I was okay for a few days after posting this. Now the weight in my chest and the bad thoughts are creeping back in again. They just... are. Every single time I think I'll get better, and then nothing at all.** **It's like my body wants to be depressed. Now I'm just... fighting myself. I want to surrender.**"

    "text": "Do you ever feel guilty that your parents got stuck with such an incompetent failure? I think about it a lot. My mom has a friend of hers who has 2 kids. One is in an Ivy League school and the other is going to a nice university. They both get good grades, have a social life, and know where they're going in life. Meanwhile my mom got stuck with a total wastoid that sits around all day on his phone. I don't drive, don't have a job, don't really wash myself unless it's been a few days or I have to go out somewhere. I have severe ADHD and don't really do well taking basic classes. I just feel so guilty that this is what my mom gets to deal with. She always tells me about how it was such a magical moment when I was first born. And I just think \"if only she knew how I would turn out.\" It wasn't her fault, though. She is such a loving caring person. She didn't deserve this. Anytime my dad comes home from work I have trouble even looking him in the eye because I know I'm probably such a disappointment in his eyes. I act normal around him but the anxiety and dread is always there in the background. I wish I could just kill myself and end the bullshit, but that would just hurt them even more. No matter what I do, everybody loses."

Still a worthless, unemployed piece of shit with no potential. Still a burden to everyone in my life. Edit: went to bed after writing this post (I say bed because actually going to sleep is a rare occurrence) and did not expect so many replies. Thank you for your kind words. Edit 2: I'm in tears right now. I really didn't expect this kind of response and I'm feeling both grateful and a bit overwhelmed. I've been at the bottom of this hole for at least 4 years and things seem to be getting worse. Letting this out felt so good and I'm truly touched by everyone's comments. I'll be honest, I just don't have the energy to reply to everyone, but I appreciate this community so much."

    "text": "I'm tired of being everyone's therapist when no one will give me ten serious minutes of their time. I've had a bunch of stuff happen to me in the past month. I got appendicitis and surgery; still recovering. Accidentally twisted my ankle. I got a cold, which I'm still fighting. However, none of that seemed to be enough for people to give me a break from emotional labor; they demand it from me 24/7, practically. Not asking for advice, really just ranting. These are just a few examples. I had my sister calling me talking about her boyfriend who just drinks all the time and does nothing, and she was complaining about how she hates where she works. I tell her to get rid of the man and get a job somewhere else. It wasn't as short as it sounds. I listened to her and gave her serious advice, though I know she won't take it because she never does. Instead of thanking me, no one ever does, she tells me that it's easy for me to tell her to just get another job because I don't have one and can just sit around and sleep. Well, thanks, I just love sitting around and thinking about my crappy life; it is a positive joy. We hadn't spoken until her son ended up in an issue and, of course, the family therapist (me) gets a text, asking me to talk to her son and try to get him to listen to \"reason\". I agree just because I know my nephew doesn't get good support from her. Come to find out, she's mad because he's dating some girl who has a kid already. I can't say it's great at his age, but he's also an adult, so I just told him to be careful, watch out for emotional abuse, and reminded him of his last relationship, which was like a copy of his mom's relationships; she doesn't realize he gets his bad examples from her. After talking to him, his mom texts me and is like, \"I'm getting off work in a few hours, I'll call and we can do a three-way call and talk to him.\" Nowhere did she ASK me if this was okay, didn't ask if I was busy or anything, but as with most of my family, since I'm at home, I never have anything important to do, so they just tell me to do stuff instead of asking, like I'm a human being. I tell her I texted him and I was still recovering and needed to sleep. She didn't ask me what I was recovering from, if I was okay, nothing. Just said, \"Okay, night.\" My niece had trouble at school and she's a lot like my sister, unable to let go of things. She's upset because some girl at school wants to fight her because my niece took her chair. A chair this girl wasn't using, mind you, but that was just sitting next to her. My niece calls me, upset and frantic over this because the girl won't let it go and went to the office and had my niece called out of class because the girl wanted an apology. My niece refused because she said she hadn't even done anything and she went to the principal, who told her that the girl is known for \"keeping things going\", so she wouldn't be bothered again, but my niece wouldn't get off the phone until I promised to stay up until she got out of school in case they call her into the office again and she wanted me to talk to them. A huge reason I don't have kids is so I don't have to deal with the stress of dealing with teachers and other parents, yet I have to be a parent to my niece because my sister won't be. Mind you, I had just come back from the doctor, had been hopped up on pain meds and wanted to do nothing, but sleep. I forced myself to stay awake, but thankfully, no one called. Then, my sister calls me and is crying, telling me how much she wants her boyfriend to leave the house. So, I don't say anything and just let her talk. Finally, she's like, \"I just don't know what to do or how to get him out of my house.\" I told her to call the police; she doesn't want to get him in any more trouble because he has a DUI because he drinks and drives. SHE allows him to drink and drive her car, because he doesn't have one and doesn't have a license. I won't even touch how stupid that is. So, I get frustrated with her and tell her that I keep telling her how to get rid of him and she never listens, so I don't know what she wants me to do. She acts like I offended her and is like, \"I just called to vent, can't I vent, sometimes?\" I tell her that she can, but I'm tired of getting calls almost every week about this man; I'm not her therapist or life coach or anything, I'm barely hanging on by a thread a lot of days and hearing about this situation distresses me because, even if I don't like her very much, I don't want to hear about anyone dealing with this type of stuff. Not to mention, her best friend was killed just a few months ago by her boyfriend who was abusive and drunk a lot... make him leave before he gets to that point. Anyway, she accuses me of making it about me and hangs up. Maybe I did make it about me, but I want people to understand that I am not a therapist and I cannot fix their issues and I'm not emotionally well enough to take on all this stuff. I'm not sure anyone is, tbh. Finally, we come to today. My mother had to take me to the doctor because I couldn't get there on my own and need support to get there. We're talking about normal stuff, then she's like, \"Aren't you tired of just sitting at home and doing nothing? You really need to get out and get a life.\" I don't ever like talking to my mom about my mental health because she acts like it's a phase that should have been over in my teens and she doesn't understand why I'm \"letting it bother me\" as an adult. I'd like to mention, she has horrible anxiety, as well, but she powers through it to work, at least, it still takes over her life. She also doesn't do much outside of the house and has no life, but when I point that out, she brings it back to me. Anyway, I tell her I just paid all the bills and since the bills got higher, I don't have money to have a life, even if I wanted to. So, then, she's like, \"If you get a job, you'd have more money.\" I know this, but I have tried many times to hold a job; I cannot do it for more than a few days without having panic attacks and breakdowns, which either end up with me leaving or getting let go, which then leads me into a deep depression. She acts like I don't try and this is even with medicine and therapy. Sometimes, I'm sure the main reason none of this works is because I'm around my family, but I never tell them that because I don't want to deal with that fallout. At this point, I'm just tired of the conversation, so I don't respond. Then, she brings up how I need to get some friends, at least... says the woman who literally has one friend and who got upset at my aunt for going out without her, even though she never goes anywhere when she invites her. Heavy eyeroll. Anyway, I tell her that I've tried to have friends; it's not my fault they don't put effort in and either they end up not talking or I fade out because nothing is happening. She asks me why I don't hang out with the people I met last summer. The two girls I met last summer were nice, but one would rarely go out with us because she would rather stay in with her boyfriend, which left me and the other girl. We hung out a few times, but then she got a new trivia group and stopped texting me back, so I stopped texting her and let that fade out. This happens too often, so I stopped trying to make friends. I tell my mom that I don't talk to them anymore, and she's like, \"That's your problem, you don't try and cut people off so quickly.\" I texted the second girl every day for a week; she wasn't working at the time and she was always posting snaps, so I knew she was available, I wasn't going to keep texting for no reason. I try to have boundaries and get crapped on for them. Unfortunately, I am not one of those people who will keep trying and trying and trying when I see things obviously aren't going along, anymore. She then goes into this long story about how she met her only friend and how they only talk like once a month, but they are still good friends and I need to be more \"realistic\" with friends. What good is a friend whom I only talk to for 10 minutes once a month and hang out with, maybe once every three months? If that works for her, great, but that's not \"getting a life\" or anything else. Plus, I have a history of getting friends and then I become the \"therapy friend\" and I fade away because all they ever do is come around to dump their problems on me and get advice, then I don't hear from them for months, when something else is going wrong. That's not friendship, to me. And go back to my mom and my aunt. My aunt is mad at my mom for \"checking up on her\" at her age and, of course, I get pulled into it because my mom is being childish and won't talk to my aunt, so I've been designated the go-between, but I never said I would be. They are 20+ years older than me, why am I even in this? I don't know. I'm just tired of being everyone's therapist and mediator. I keep trying to explain how draining it is. They obviously see I have my own issues, but they continually pour their issues onto me, expect sincere, helpful, empathetic responses, but let me feel bad or need something and everyone is busy or doesn't answer their phones or I get \"advice\" that isn't helpful. My niece and nephew would probably talk, but I don't want to burden them with my issues; their mother does that to them enough, and they complain about it, to me, of course. What is it about me that makes everyone think I'm a therapist? Plus, none of them pay me for my services. That probably makes me more upset than anything; if I was a real therapist, I'd probably be rich off all these \"sessions\", lol."

    "text": "Im begging somebody to read this I desperately need to feel like I have a friend there for me right now. Posting this on a few subs because I don‚Äôt know what to do. I feel like I‚Äôve reached my breaking point. Im so tired. I‚Äôm so tired of existing. I‚Äôm so tired of being mad. I‚Äôm so tired of being tired. It‚Äôs pathetic. I‚Äôm a 25 year old adult who‚Äôs stuck living at home with my family. I can feel myself falling apart and I‚Äôm reaching the point where I‚Äôm finally just going to take myself out of this shitty game called life, or I‚Äôm going to end up cutting ties all together with my family, which is where I‚Äôll probably sink. If it‚Äôs sink or swim out in the big world. I am holding on to so many grudges. From so many years. That I clearly can‚Äôt cope with in a healthy way. My heart hurts so much but I‚Äôm such a glutton for punishment that I can‚Äôt bring myself to stop carrying around all this hate. And it is absolutely one hundred percent consuming me alive. I‚Äôll try and use brackets to section off my thoughts since I doubt anybody cares enough to actually read this all the way through. {My thoughts on my father} {{{{As an adult now. I realize that I spent probably the first 18 years of my life. Living in literal fear of my pseudo racist father. I still remember being 6 years old or so and hearing my mother scream for my brother because my father was choking her in their bedroom. Was a big steroid fan back in the day. I spent most of my middle school and high school career grounded from one semester to the next one because I frequently got C‚Äôs in school which my parents would ground us for. Even one C on the report card and it was grounded for the rest of the semester. I still remember getting in trouble so badly for lying about doing my homework, not even so much for not doing my homework. But it was distinctly about lying about it. My father was beating me in our dining room and at one point was physically choking me against the wall, and I remember my mother saying ‚Äúwell Don‚Äôt choke him (insert name)‚Äù and him looking straight at her with his hands around my neck saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not choking him‚Äù I still remember that same night him having to come in my room to change my ice packs on my swollen face and how petrified I was that the gameboy sp I was playing was flung off the bed in a room with no carpet because I was certain I was going to get beat again. I remember going to school the next and having to tell my teachers (because all six of them forced me to stay after class and talk about it) that I was playing football with my brother and fell on a sprinkler. Funny how their response to me lying about homework was to in turn go to school and lie about why half of my face was swollen and black. I remember the first time i was ever caught shoplifting (was obviously my last time doing it too) when my dad came to pick me up, he was already so nasty to me before leaving the store that the police threatened to not let me leave because he was already trying to hit me in front of them. But you know. Now that I‚Äôm an adult and have been jumped literally just because of my sexuality. If I‚Äôm going to get my ass beat I‚Äôm going to get my ass beat. I‚Äôm just not living in fear anymore. }}}} {my thoughts on my brother} {{{{Which brings me to my brother. Who as of lately might as well be dead to me. We have not currently spoken since April, and as far as I‚Äôm concerned we probably won‚Äôt ever speak again. Let‚Äôs start with me saying I feel like my brothers relationship with me has always been from the start. Me bailing him out when he needs it. I remember being in elementary school and him getting to go back to sleep after my mother woke us up for breakfast and would leave for work, because it was my job to ‚Äúwake him up after rugrats‚Äù when he was about 12 or 13 he got mixed up with a bad neighborhood kid and ended up almost lighting an entire house on fire in our neighborhood. The police officers were nice enough to offer him the deal that if you stay out of trouble until you‚Äôre 18 this will be completely removed off your record with no trace of it ever even happening. Sure enough he starts smoking weed in high school (which is back when it was HIGHLY frowned upon) and guess who had to take every single drug test for his four years of high school. My dumb ass. Bailing him out again. Until finally he got caught coming back late from lunch (upper class men were at the time allowed to leave campus for lunch) and he came back with a hotboxed car and didn‚Äôt air it out. So when the principle stopped him to ask why he was late she was literally hit with a cloud of smoke. My brother was the sole reason my high school was no longer allowed to leave campus for lunch. My brother and father have always had an awful relationship too obviously all this places even more tension on it, and eventually lead to him either being kicked out or leaving. I don‚Äôt remember which. Being on the streets on his own he was arrested more times for carrying stupid large amounts of weed on him because he sells it, and eventually got charged I think with robbery. Then to top it all off, a few years ago my brother got mixed up in the flocka epidemic. And of course there‚Äôs my dumbass bailing him out again being forced to put two stolen bikes in my car and drive him to Miami. When I first started realizing how much I hated him was I think my senior year of high school. My parents had gone out of town leaving him in charge. I remember distinctly it was the night before vans warped tour he‚Äôs in a huge fight with his at the time girlfriend, because he was literally hitting either her, or her and/or her kid. And I remember he stormed into my room flinging open the door trying to use me as an excuse ‚Äúisn‚Äôt this okay because it‚Äôs what dad used to do to us. ‚Äú of course having a criminal record he couldn‚Äôt find a job and was on probation at my parents house and because nobody wanted to hire somebody with his record they literally gave him a fucking job at the company my father works for. This job is 15$ an hour, gets benefit and vacation days. I on the other hand spent years being treated like shit in jobs. Two years ago I worked for quiksilver over the course of about a year, finally left because they told me and a coworker that we were the ones being considered for management and yet they brought in two outside hires after the second one the other coworker had the sense to leave. My dumb ass stayed thinking well now that she‚Äôs gone it‚Äôll look better on me. Which is when they brought in another outside hire. Who I was eventually cool with. I just stopped offering to do the management work for sales associate pay. Until I finally got so fed up that I transferred to GameStop because they were willing to start me as a keyholder since I already had basic management training. So two years trying to work for a manager only to be shit on by my parents because it‚Äôs not full time and ‚Äúat your age your brother worked full time‚Äù at my age y‚Äôall gave him a fucking career because nobody wanted to hire a literal criminal. Anything I do It‚Äôs just never going to be good enough. Let me talk about our most recent altercation, because it‚Äôs a fantastic transition into my mother, as of last April I was unfortunately unemployed thanks to this whole virus outbreak, and of course that sets off my family members because I sleep all day while they work. So my mother asked me on April 20th the day before my birthday (a day that I was operating on approximately 2 hours of sleep because I‚Äôm always up all night) if I could go help my brother in the warehouse where he works because he really needs it. I have already had altercations with my brother there from helping him a previous time. It was so bad that they sent me home early. So being there in general makes me uncomfortable. Even when I go in to help my dads department. So of course I didn‚Äôt want to help which wasn‚Äôt an acceptable answer to my mother and after about the 5th time of her saying something obviously I snapped and agreed to which she responded ‚Äúforget it‚Äù and slammed my door shut. (It should be noted that in my mother‚Äôs defense I‚Äôm a nightmare to wake up because of how little I sleep. There are times I wake up and am in a fight with my mother because she apparently tried to wake me up and I was nasty, meanwhile I have literally no recollection of even speaking to her ) so my dumb ass trying to bite the bullet agrees to go work for eight hours in a hot sweaty warehouse with barely any ac on my birthday of all days. I woke up that morning still mad about the fight I had with my mother the day prior because I feel like as a grown ass adult I should be allowed to say no I don‚Äôt want to do something. Get to the warehouse work the shift, I leave at five, which apparently was a mistake because I wasnt supposed to leave until 5:30 which I thought was fine because 1) I genuinely thought they left at 5 every day and 2) I didn‚Äôt take a lunch break because I was hoping if we happened to get everything done early we would just be able to leave. Obviously that was wrong and I got a shitty passive aggressive text message from my brother. Having already been in a bad mood from my fight with my mother the day before partnered with my brother annoying me after I had left I stopped by aunts house to vent because I was literally seeing red. Wasn‚Äôt even planning on going home for my birthday because I just didn‚Äôt want to be around any of them. The next day comes and I don‚Äôt show up because not only did I not want to be there, but when I had gotten there the day before another employee of that company said ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt know if we‚Äôll need you tomorrow or not yet‚Äù so I just didn‚Äôt bother to show up because if y‚Äôall needed me you should have worked that into your text message when you were being an asshole in my opinion. So of course my petty ass isn‚Äôt going to show up. My brother comes home through the door doesn‚Äôt even put his shit down and is in my face screaming at me for not showing up ‚Äúwhy should I have to explain to my boss why you didn‚Äôt come‚Äù ‚Äúwhy do you get to sleep all day while we work I‚Äôm sick of it‚Äù turning to my mother ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sick of him aren‚Äôt y‚Äôall sick of him‚Äù (to which she agrees probably just trying to get him to calm down, but I won‚Äôt ever for a second forget you just said you were sick of me. ) and of course I‚Äôm running my mouth back in return, which is when he decided to put his hands on me, shoving me literally to the floor. And this is about where I Black out with anger because I had my Nintendo switch in my hand. The limited edition no longer in production animal crossing themed one at that. So obviously I‚Äôm pissed and yank his PlayStation out of the wall and slam it on the ground. You can skip the next parentheses part if you don‚Äôt care about why a stupid video game console made me so upset. (A detour to mention about these video game consoles. My brother and I used to exclusively use Xbox but I made the transition to the PS4 when it came out. My brother didn‚Äôt. I had been asking for a PlayStation 4 since they came out for both my birthday and Christmas for I think like two years. Until the year my brother spent Christmas in jail because he was addicted to flocka. When my mom finally bailed him out because she felt like he was actually clean, he got a PlayStation 4. When I asked why he got one and I didn‚Äôt despite it literally being the only thing I asked for as a Christmas gift, she said ‚Äúwell he wasn‚Äôt here for Christmas so I had to make it special.‚Äù I think I eventually got the PlayStation for my birthday the following year. But this fucking switch man. I swore up and down when I was a GameStop employee that they were going to make an animal crossing version and they all laughed at me said if it was going to happen it would have already and talked me into buying just a standard switch instead. Low and behold a few weeks later the animal crossing one is announced and I‚Äôm lowkey heartbroken that I just spent a majority of my money on the standard one. I eventually get myself so worked up over it that I asked my mom to front me the money to buy the new system, and I will give her 200 when I sell my switch and the rest from my next paycheck. She‚Äôs talking some I can‚Äôt I don‚Äôt have that kind of money, which would have been totally fine. I was just embarrassed that I not only put my pride away to ask for money, but was also upset enough about not getting the animal crossing one to even be in this situation. So whatever whatever we end up agreeing on if I sell the console first and give her the two hundred she will give me the rest. Where as I was only asking her for the front because I didn‚Äôt want to risk selling my console before the new one came out and risk then not having a console at all. Especially since I had already missed like two years of the switches lifespan. So obviously I‚Äôm super thankful to my mom and I literally spent like two days thanking her and talking to her about it, only for me to find out that she had given me my own money. I don‚Äôt know what it was for, possibly my unemployment since the console came out around the time the virus was starting to flare. And at that point all I can keep thinking is wow. You really kept my own money from me, made me gamble on being able to find a limited edition console without a preorder. And told me you couldn‚Äôt loan me anything. That makes me so mad. How are you going to lie about my own damn money. Serves me right I guess for not being adult enough to stop using our joint bank account.) Anyway. I slam his PlayStation on the ground after he put his hand on me the first time we get into a screaming match in his room to which I say something along the lines of ‚Äúyou‚Äôre allowed to knock my switch out of my hand so why should you expect any different of your PlayStation‚Äù to which he responds (talking out of his ass) ‚Äúwell you didn‚Äôt pay for it mom did!‚Äù Jokes on you asshole not only did I pay for it entirely with my money but our mother literally withheld my own money from me and made it more difficult for me to get an already difficult to get console. This ends up with him coming back into my room because everyone in my family (myself included) has to have the last word in argument. Which leads to him putting his hands on me a second time except this time since there‚Äôs not a 400$ gaming system in my hand I pull his disgusting ass down with me.}}}}} This whole fight somehow ends with me being kicked out of my house by my mother. {my thoughts on my mother} {{{{Fun fact. Maybe about a week before this my mother was begging me to stop going out despite taking precautions with a mask and specially made sanitizer consisting of primarily alcohol. Because they had a friend in critical condition from covid. This is the same woman who threw her kid out into streets during the first peak of this epidemic. (I‚Äôm in Florida so it is at this moment higher than that first peak because Floridians are trash) so I spend the next three or four day sleeping in my car doing whatever trying to manage on my own, spending what little money I had fixing the joycon drift on my switch that was non existent until my brother attacked me with it in my hand. One thing leads to another and I eventually end up back home. I asked my mom if we could start family therapy because I‚Äôm literally holding onto grudges that I don‚Äôt know how to let go of. She says when all of this is over but I‚Äôm positive she‚Äôs forgotten about it and it might very well be what causes me to cut her out all together. A few days ago me and my mother got into a huge arguement because she woke me up to ask me to take her to firestone to pick up her car(I‚Äôm exhausted but totally not a problem to me at all) so I get right up get dressed grab my keys and when I walk out of my room she goes ‚Äúare you ready now I‚Äôm not in a rush or anything‚Äù I was a little annoyed by the stupid question I‚Äôll admit, like you just two minutes ago came into my room to wake me up and ask me to take you. Yes I‚Äôm ready to go lol. Otherwise I‚Äôd still be asleep. She of course takes my flat response (a slight mixture of both my annoyance and exhaustion) as me being in a bad mood. So we get into my car and she‚Äôs overreacting because my car is a little shaky (which I‚Äôm almost positive is just because I need air in my tires) talking some oh my god we have to pull over what if you have a flat. Like we definitely would know if we were driving on a flat tire. It‚Äôs been doing this since like the second week I got this car. So I‚Äôm just sitting there trying to get to the destination as fast as possible trying to hold my tongue and not cause a fight when she sets me off and says something along the lines of ‚Äúyou‚Äôre in a bad mood because I asked you to take me‚Äù my response being ‚Äúoh what I‚Äôm in a bad mood because I got right up to do something you asked me to do???‚Äù which fucking infuriated me and caused a screaming match in my car. I don‚Äôt understand why she has this god complex where she thinks she gets to tell other people how they feel about something. She did it to me on my birthday too which I forgot to mention and am now too lazy to go back and add in. But like it drives me crazy. I don‚Äôt care if they‚Äôre right wrong or somewhere in between. Nobody has the right to decide how somebody feels about something except for that person. So when I sit there and tell you I‚Äôm not mad and you tell me ‚Äúyes you are mad that‚Äôs why you‚Äôre being shitty‚Äù that‚Äôs a self fulfilling prophecy right there. Of course that shits going to make me mad. If you‚Äôre just going to decide I‚Äôm in a bad mood for me then shit I guess I‚Äôm in a bad fucking mood then. So this screaming match in my car leads to her saying ‚ÄúI hope something happens to your car, and when it does DONT call me‚Äù. I will never ever in a million years forget she said that to me. I hope that when something does happen to my car, I‚Äôm inside of it, I hope it‚Äôs something fatal, and I hope she has to live with it for the rest of her life. And then of course after our screaming match she sends me a passive aggressive text message (because apparently my family is famous for doing that shit) talking some I won‚Äôt be screamed at in a car that I bought you, you are SO disrespectful the next time you talk to me like that you can find a new place to live! (As if she didn‚Äôt kick me out when I was 16, and 18, and 23. Like clearly I can manage in my car bitch try me. I would rather starve to death on the streets than feel like I need help from someone who treats me like shit) Skip the parentheses if you don‚Äôt care about context with my car history (Both me and my brother were fortunate enough to get cars for our 16th birthday. The difference between us is my brother has wrecked I think 2 cars my parents bought him, one car they gave him because my mom got a new car (which that one he wasn‚Äôt at fault for but still it‚Äôs a car to add to your tally) and ruined one of my dads trucks that he was using for whatever reason one day. I on the other hand drove the same car that I had since I was 16 until literally this year when I turned 25 and was given a new one. But honestly my parents had been trying to buy me another one for a few years I just fought them on it because I didn‚Äôt want a new car which I will explain why later. ) And then now just today, we are in another arguement because I think last night, my brother walked out our back gate to go sell drugs in our mailbox because he thinks he‚Äôs cool and tough and can handle jail as if he isn‚Äôt literally crying ‚Äúmommy bail me out‚Äù when he‚Äôs in there. As he‚Äôs going out he knocks over the ashtray I had been using over there (which was admittedly in the walkway but only because that particular night I was in a hurry to relocate under my backyard awning because it was raining and I had all my technology on me) but when he walks back he has the nerve to say to me ‚Äúyour ashtray is knocked over ‚Äú as if i wasn‚Äôt outside and heard him kick it over like I‚Äôm supposed to lean up after him. Despite us having literally not a said a word to eachother since April. So I hid the ashtray that he normally uses with the mindset of ‚Äúif he needs an ashtray he‚Äôll have to go over and clean up the one he kicked over.‚Äù Only for me to find that my mother ended up being the one to clean up his mess. Which of course infuriated me. And then she had the nerve to defend him in a text message after we got into an arguement about it. ‚ÄúWell it is your ashtray...‚Äù okay did I kick over my ashtray or did my brother. Because that‚Äôs the person who should have cleaned it up was who knocked it over. In regards to my mother specifically it hurts me the most. Because I often at times feels like she‚Äôs the only one out of the 3 of my immediately family that I could have a relationship with or that I actively want to have a relationship with and that bridge is so close to being burnt to a crips. I don‚Äôt want to appear ungrateful because as a mother she does go above and beyond. I‚Äôve been spoiled sure. But my problem with it is, I feel like my mother only gives as much as she gives so that she has ammunition to hold over peoples head. I fought her for YEARS about getting a new because I knew she would just hold it over my head. Which obviously I was right about. I remember being kicked out when I was 18 because I wasn‚Äôt working and i had just gotten kicked out of college and she said leave your keys pack your stuff and find somewhere to live. So I did set off with no car no money no nothing ended up being taken in by my best friends family. Spent a year or two there, and I literally did not get my car back (the same one she had given me at 16) until the girl I was living with literally called her in tears asking if we could just borrow it so we could go see her mother who was in the hospital because she needed brain surgery. LITERAL BRAIN SURGERY was the only reason I got my car back. And it still took my friend like two or three times of asking my mother for her to let me use my car just to take her to see her mother. My father has always babied me and let me get away with more than he lets my brother get away with I can admit that. The problem with it is, that because I don‚Äôt feel the same type of yearning for a relationship about my father that I do about my mother I don‚Äôt really care about him favoring me. And because my dad tends to let me get away with more my mom feels like she has to let my brother get away with more, which in turn causes me to always just feel like I‚Äôm chasing my mother‚Äôs approval or some shit. }}}} {thoughts on my own disgusting self} It‚Äôs only been recently that I‚Äôm starting to come around to my father and that‚Äôs only because I think I‚Äôm starting to hate my mother. I know I probably sound ungrateful and entitled. And I can see why. But I am truly thankful for how privilege I‚Äôve been and all that I‚Äôve been given. But I don‚Äôt know how to not feel the way that I feel about these things. And that‚Äôs not to say I‚Äôm perfect either. I‚Äôve caused plenty of problem for my family. So let me just skip to all my flaws now. When I was a kid like before I could even start kindergarten I was literally already sucking dick. My next door neighbor ( my brothers age at the time) used to make me do it to him and I used to agree because he was considerably nicer to me when I do would so. He was already a problem child too but that‚Äôs neither here nor there. I was pretty much only sucking him off because my brother always hated when I would hang out with him and his friends, and the neighbor always let me hang around (for obvious reasons) distinctly remember my brother catching us a few times but I guess nothing was ever done about it. Not even sure if my parents know about it. But as an adult I can see that‚Äôs where I started getting fucked up. Idk if I necessarily blame my neighbor for me being gay, because I do firmly as a gay man believe that it‚Äôs just who you are and can‚Äôt be changed, but I feel like there will literally always be a part of me that questions it. Like what if I wasn‚Äôt sucking dick at five years old, would I be interested in girls? I remember having a crush on at least two different girls before i met (what I now as an adult realize was probably my first boy crush) like looking back on my child hood I vividly remember playing ‚Äúdoctor‚Äù with other kids or truth or dare that always ended sexual and I realize like damn. That‚Äôs fucking gross we were all kids. Fast forward to me being in I think middle school, and I was caught sexually experimenting with my cousin. I was definitely old enough to know better so I take fault there, but I also wasn‚Äôt ever the one initiating it. You know. I was letting him suck me off for longer than I can remember honestly, but I also distinctly remember I wasn‚Äôt the one initiating it. I still remember the first night at his house when he asked me to go pornhub and grilling him about how he even knows about that. I don‚Äôt remember when I started letting him do stuff to me, but I know that I shouldn‚Äôt have. I remember well enough that when he would come sleepover there were times I would opt to stay up late with my father in hopes that he would fall asleep waiting for me to come in. I remember one time I was up late and he comes walking out like 2 hours after being put to bed because he was trying to get me to come in to bed with him. But again I was the older kid in that situation. So that‚Äôs my fuck up. Obviously when we got caught it put a wedge between that side of our family. I can see why, but in hindsight I always wonder. Would you have still distanced yourself if you knew it was your son who had been initiating it? Because he was younger all the blame was pushed onto me. And I can see why. Again I should have known better. That‚Äôs probably around the time I started getting fat. By high school at one point I was over 300 pounds and openly gay. Never had a serious relationship. Never even had someone interested in a relationship with me. I can see why. Not only was I cringey in high school but I was literally disgusting. It wasn‚Äôt till about my senior year I finally got back under 300 pounds and started losing some weight and gaining some confidence. But here‚Äôs the kicker. Before I started losing the weight I had become a literal serial catfisher. And I‚Äôm talking like anybody you wanted to see naked I would go out of my way to target. Friends, friends boyfriends. Nobody was off limits to me. It makes me sick thinking about the hundreds of people I‚Äôve catfished because I was horny and lonely. Catfishing even basically got me kicked out of my college ( granted I was surprisingly innocent at that time but because the kid found out about me being a catfish he refused to believe it wasn‚Äôt me, despite me literally having to show my catfish accounts to the dean and them not matching up to whoever he was talking to. The college only realized their mistake a semester or two later because the kid was immediately put on academic probation the semester following my suspension, and then got caught trying to do the same thing to another gay student the semester after that. Which is when they were like wow we were wrong we‚Äôre so sorry don‚Äôt even worry about the requirements we gave you for coming back you can just come back never did though.) It wasn‚Äôt only until I hit maybe 22 or 23 that it like clicked with how awful what I was doing was. And started making an active effort to stop it. And I feel like I was only even willing to because I fell in genuine love with somebody I was catfishing. When I finally told him, we were fine for a few days. He told me he didn‚Äôt care that I was a guy because he fell in love with the person behind a screen. But all of that quickly crumbled to ashes. That‚Äôs another one that‚Äôs my own fault. Not only was I doing something shitty but I was also in too deep. I think I still to this day get texted from somebody I started catfishing when I was about 15 or 16 that I just am too afraid to finally tell the truth to. But since the recent heart break I‚Äôve thankfully been able to almost entirely remove catfishing from life save for the one guy I was in too deep with, and the old catfish accounts that I occasionally log into when I‚Äôm desperately alone/horny/whatever it may be. I‚Äôm tired of feeling alone. I just want to be loved. I want someone to want me. To care about me. I‚Äôm starting to realize this world is awful. Almost every thing and everyone in it is bleak. Some people genuinely want to live long happy lives, me personally, I don‚Äôt think I can make it doing this shit for another 25 years. Self deprecating jokes and suicidal humor are my biggest weapons. Because I feel like if I don‚Äôt turn them into jokes. I‚Äôll let them overcome me. Too many people in this world are awful. I don‚Äôt want to be one anymore. I doubt any of you will actually care enough to read this through. But if you for some unknown reason did, then I thank you. Because I could really use a friend. TLDR; I‚Äôm a scumbag. I‚Äôm starting to think my family is scumbags, and I‚Äôm genuinely losing my will to live. I‚Äôve been holding on to grudges that are literally consuming me and transforming me into a being of hatred and it makes me sick to my stomach. I don‚Äôt know how much longer I can do this, but god I would absolutely love to just be taken out by a bus tomorrow."

Not having to hate myself, going through life everyday while nothing seems to make me happy anymore. Then my younger sister gave me a rock she painted for me. Blue with a guitar on it, and a moon with stars in the middle of the guitar. It said made in 2020, Love Nikole. I almost cried in front of her which is something she's never seen me do. It just hit me so hard, like beyond words. My family is very loving but they mostly keep to themselves. I just thought to myself, how could I put her and everyone else through such a thing. Spent half the night crying like a little girl, I'm 34M. Still woke up feeling like garbage, but I dunno somethings different, I guess that feeling like someone's thinking of me is helping a bit. I can't say anything to her now but in the future I'm really gonna thank her for that. I still feel like I don't wanna be here, but whereas before it was 100%, now I'm slightly on the fence about it. Hopefully this is a little inspiration for those out there thinking like me. I should probably reach out to her but things like that are so hard for me, plus then the whole family would know. Thats why i like coming here. It hurts but I feel like I must press on."

Every social situation that felt like actual torture. Every time you were CONVINCED you couldn't make it through? You did. You're still here, reading this post.

    "text": "I hate exams because they stress me so much. I (14M) have an extreme fear of exams. Especially if it's an exam in a subject where I'm weak at. I just hate them so much. If I get a bad grade, my parents will be very angry at me (asian parents of course). Exams just drain every ounce of my willpower to study along with any positivity that I have. Even if I do study, my mom will bombard me with questions, force me to learn even more and just ruin my way of studying in general. I remember I memorized 4 fantasy stories for an exam (where we had to write a fantasy story of course, and yes, children already have tests/exams worth 50% of the grade at 4th grade) when I was 11 and memorized tons of other stories for an exam for 5 hours straight when I was 12. Now I just don't want to study because it is NOT fun at all and the stuff that I studied for the exam won't be used for the rest of the year. The anxiety I get from exams flip my mood 180¬∞ and no matter what I do (go outside, play video games, talk with friends, etc.), it doesn't help. My anxiety only gets better once I survive through the exam and all the lectures my parents give me for my bad grade. And if y'all are wondering, my grades are very good, I have A's and B's on every subject except for german and woodworking, where I have a C. I love learning about stuff which I'm geniunely interested in, like game development (specifically coding), airplanes, trains, etc. I could probably learn about these things for hours on end and still not get bored. But when it comes to these exams where teachers and parents act like it's a life-or-death situation then learning seems like poison in my eyes."

Worrying about how youre affecting others and wanting that reassurance that you‚Äôre doing okay and that everything will be okay even when you‚Äôre in the wrong. Aka apologizing over and over again hoping someone will forgive you. But what‚Äôs messed up is that sometimes when anxiety is caused by the reassurance need not being met as a child, it manifests as you seeking that reassurance constantly later. So regardless of if you needed that reassurance and never got it so you had to quickly learn how to get it from people or give it to yourself, if you needed that reassurance later in life, you‚Äôre just going to end up having to meet your own need again. And in the case of you having disappointed or hurt someone, the only person to blame is you. I resent anxiety quite a bit for that."

    "text": "Can't stop thinking about mortality Hi, I'm 17F, going through an insanely hard time. This is going to be toooo long, but I am going crazy. For the past few days, I can't stop thinking about death, mortality, and how we are our brains, how we have bodies, how there might be no spirit, no point, no point if you forget and lose everything you've ever had or done. It's insane. I have NEVER felt this way before. I don't believe in the Christian god, but I naturally believe in a higher power - the universe, fate, destiny, that life is like a story, that I will find a soulmate, and always leaning towards reincarnation or something similar. I have always perceived death as a stage, not the END. I have always felt at peace with it, and connected to it somehow. It was FINE. It was GOOD. When I was younger I used to have suicidal thoughts. Maybe not serious ones, never was going to go through with it, but I wasn't afraid to embrace death, it felt like a step in life. When I was even younger I had a few day period of thinking \"this person will die\" looking at anyone, but it wasn't some sort of morbid fear. It should be nothing new. A few months ago I ended up in the hospital for a few days because of a mysterious chest pain, I was sleep deprived, overworked, dehydrated... I had symptoms of a heart attack (no heart issues detected, I got better after being released), I genuinely spent those few days thinking I'd die. I was convinced it was a possibility then. The hospital advised me to get in therapy but I really didn't feel a need for it. But it STILL didn't feel so alien then. I was just upset that I led myself into not having enough time, I was motivated to create, be kind and live even better. I wasn't scared of the after, I just felt that I need more time! I am an artist and I have always believed in souls and meaning. I was happy just to live and I cherish my moments. A few days ago, I woke up very early before a test, and this just popped up in my head, like someone turned a switch. All those thoughts that we are animals, that there is no meaning. I don't even doubt animals have souls, that everything has a soul, I don't know. It's driving me insane. And even when I accepted everything in my head, I realized - this might not be a fear of death at all, I just think I became hyperaware of my consciousness and started losing my sense of identity. I know it's temporary. I get weird anxious thoughts every few months or years that bug me for a few days like this, about anything. But it just feels so bad. It's like stressful derealization. I want to be normal again. I am still a kid. I am not even actively, or rationally, worrying. It's just like something in the back of my head. A fear of fear. A fear of fearing this for any longer. This is the first time in my life I feel like it's something that is challenging to get through by myself, for the first time I feel like I need therapy or medication. Usually I can distance myself from any trouble by engaging with something else and can bend my mind to my will with ease. I spent the whole weekend, depressed, scrolling through TikTok (I haven't touched it for a year) in my bed, trying to remember how to LIVE again through the nonsense I watch. I feel like a ghost, jealous of other people for being alive, as if I am the only person aware of death. As if I forgot how to live without thinking about this 24/7. I even woke up in the middle of the night, the thoughts in my subconscious before I could even think of them myself. Normally, I feel bad wasting any time doing \"nothing\" or consuming content instead of creating. This weekend, I have no regrets, I just want it to stop. It's not even a conscious fear at this point, it's like I unlocked something. I immediately feel better and distanced from those thoughts after writing it down, but I think it's a very brief addiction to reassurance. I want to be stressed about life. The feeling is like... disgust. It's so disgusting and repulsive to have my mind tainted like this."

I‚Äôm in a relationship, which for now is long-distance, but my girlfriend visits me, she recently came. A couple of years ago, I became curious about losing my virginity through penetration with a man, and I decided to do it with an older man, around 50 years old. For some reason, I felt it would be easier with someone older than someone my age, and less weird. I wanted someone to use me, I suppose. I did it, and at first, I felt disgust, and afterwards, it was awful. I felt so dirty. By the way, it was only penetration, nothing else, no kissing, nothing, i was very specific to not do it. About a year later, my mind pushed me to do it again. I went on a casual sex website, talked to someone, no photos, and they came in the early morning, penetrated me, and left. The same thing happened 2-3 more times. I didn‚Äôt enjoy any of these encounters at all. I dissociate, and at the end, when they leave, I feel nauseous and disgusted. Through all of this, I always consented, no one took advantage of me, but it was like I was on autopilot, not caring that I was hating it. I want to stop doing it, I feel terrible, I have no libido with my girlfriend, even though I love her and want to be with her.

Addictive maniacs who abuse any drug and than they cry on forums are big problem - they run reputation of this awesome drug.

Based on that, I‚Äôve always assumed I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). I also struggle with chronic fear, constant worry, and social anxiety. But lately, I‚Äôve been wondering if it‚Äôs something else‚Äîor something more. My anxiety doesn‚Äôt really come with a racing heart or shortness of breath anymore. My heart rate stays normal, even when I‚Äôm feeling anxious. Instead, I feel this weird burning sensation in my veins, almost like my body is wired or agitated.

Or could it be a somatic symptom disorder, or maybe something that hasn‚Äôt been well studied yet? I feel more psychological symptoms than physical, but this body sensation is confusing me. Has anyone else experienced something like this?"

Being so exhausted that I don't have the energy after dealing with stress to go and, say, do an art project or work on something around the house. (When I have energy, I am a productivity machine and clear my entire to do list in hours). 2. I show up early for anything important because I am so scared of being late and making people \"hate me\". 3. I need more sleep to catch up on not being able to sleep, because not sleeping makes me feel chaotic. 4. Even when I have time to recharge, I can't seem to relax, or I get stressed about needing to relax so I can be a normal person again and not a \"burden\". 5. I need to know some things in advance to mitigate my brain's reaction picking my order on menus before we get to the restaurant becausewhen everyone is waiting for me to order, my mind goes blank, my mouth tastes like ash, and the thought of eating anything feels like a waste of time). My in-laws are the type of vibrant, lovely people who call you up and say, \"Hey, we're heading ____ now. Want to join us?\" I do not. Because I spent all day in my pajamas and my hair is a mess and I won't look like someone who has their shit together if I do. I'm sure this is kind of a standard thing with anxiety but I'd like to feel like I'm not the only one for a bit, if you'll grant me that. üòÖ"

    "text": "Anxiety at night I need help. I‚Äôm a 20-year veteran with 4 deployments. During my first deployment, I suffered an injury on the left side of my face that required 2 surgeries (septoplasty and turbinoplasty) to repair a deviated septum and remove scar and bone/calcium built up after the injury. Before the surgery, it felt like I couldn‚Äôt breathe out of my left side nose trail and affected my running and other physical activities until the surgery. 25 years have passed since then, but now I am starting to have some issues again. A few months ago, I began to suddenly wake up in the middle of the night with extreme anxiety, feeling like I couldn‚Äôt breathe. I ran outside the house feeling like I was drowning. It was wintertime, so the cold somehow helped, and little by little, with the help of my wife, I began to calm down. It had never happened before until now. Since then, I spoke to my PCM at the VA and got a referral for ENT. My psych prescribed a few Xanax for the anxiety for when it hits the worst. The ENT says there is not a deviated septum (which was my first though) not scar tissue built up over time (like before) but since the first time it happened, I started trying every single thing I can find to try to help it‚Ä¶ from trying every single nose device that flares the nose to break better at night (have found a few that work, but my inside of the nose is now raw from the in/out and the mucus irritating it from the foreign device that was never before there), the Airwav mouth guard, trying Afrin and phenols prone sprays (kids dose only at night before bed), but it seems that ow has become a crutch and I can‚Äôt sleep without all of these things‚Ä¶ the thought of having to do this every night gives me even more anxiety. I remember the surgery I had. They put those plastic blades in the sinus cavity, and I remember I couldn‚Äôt breathe but through my mouth then. And the thought of it gives me anxiety. I don‚Äôt think I can make it through weeks of having those things in my nose for weeks until it heals, swelling goes down, and pain subsides‚Ä¶ never mind that I can‚Äôt take pain meds because of prior issues with narcotics due to multiple surgeries over a 3-year period that kept me on pain management long-term that did their own damage‚Ä¶ now it‚Äôs all me, nothing but Tylenol, and as I type this with my wife lying in bed next to me at 1:24AM not able to sleep because of this crippling anxiety that makes me have to take a half Xanax just to hope to be able to sleep while listening to anxiety-reducing meditations on YouTube‚Ä¶ I am at a loss, and my mind wonders where it shouldn‚Äôt after thinking about it, having to deal with this long-term and worse, putting my wife through this‚Ä¶ it affects everything from sleep, turns what could be a good day into a bad one, and I am tired of it‚Ä¶ I just wanted to put this out there to see if someone else experiences this, knows what ‚Äúthis‚Äù is, does it have a name? A cure? What have you done to try to fix it that has worked?‚Ä¶ I need to figure out how to control it before it takes over‚Ä¶ any help is greatly appreciated."

    "text": "Setback and need to get this off my chest + sharing some thoughts. Content Note: symptom description Hi everyone. I just joined Reddit because I feel like I have to get this off my chest. I have the most supportive family and they understand as good as they can but you all **get** it. I've been diagnosed with social phobia/anxiety/depressive mood when i was 15 (am 33 now). The worst part about my anxiety is that I'm like 5% resilient. Which gets me to the actual point. I usually make appointments (doctors etc) as early in the day as possible because then I have it behind me and can 'enjoy' the rest of the day lol. Though I'm like 2 days pre-anxious about any appointment and it ruins those two days. Anyways. I needed to get a fresh haircut, called my hairdresser, and got a spontaneous spot in the afternoon. It was a disaster. Not the hair (love it, and my hairdresser is the sweetest) but everything else. First, it was really warm outside. I have very light skin and warmth (inside or outside) always makes my face glow, especially the cheeks. Additionally I get these hectic (?) spots in random areas on my face, forehead, and neck. I'm leaving the car. There was a skateboarder and I literally thought it's the loudest thing I ever heard. Plus, friday afternoon a lot of people are out and about and at that point it became too much. I had no idea where to go, walked into the wrong direction until my dad pointed me in the right one. At the hair salon I sat there, looking in the mirror, and I saw that my face turned into a blood moon. Everything red except the area around my mouth which made me look like I just drank milk lol. Back at home I was ***exhausted*** and noticed the first symptoms (headache, a bit nauseous). Yesterday was peak zero. I felt that butterfly-sensation in my stomach, like creeping panic, and just had all the symptoms (nausea, dizziness, lightheadedness, weird eye thing) and went to bed very early. There I just cried relentlessly. Until I got tired and fell asleep. I slept 14 hours straight and am now back at ca 50%. What made me cry the most though were all the memories of the time when I was still healthy. My pre anxiety life. I miss my old self. I was shy, but never that introverted. Though I'm very grateful for my life and I even like myself nowadays, but I can't stop comparing myself to \"normal\" people. Those who have a job (I'm currently on disability), and go somewhere fun. Football (soccer) stadiums or concerts for example. I realised that I might never go to a concert because the loudness would blow my brain out. Then again, I think that I don't have to do what others do. That it's perfectly ok to go my own way. Instead of concerts I might just go to the planetarium. I also know that I have good days, not so good days, bad days, and excellent days. Just because friday was a fiasco doesn't mean that all future days have to be... right? It's just that right now in this moment I can't even imagine feeling better although I rationally know that it's not gonna be like this forever. I think I'm just scared that one day I'll never recover from a situation like this. Then again we're all stronger than we think we are. I feel like I'm all over the place. Sorry that it's so long and sorry for grammar errors. I hope that you all have a peaceful day."

    "text": "Suddenly having anxiety related episodes I've had a very few run ins with anxiety situations throughout the past ten years. But a LOT more so recently. I'd say the past two years. I don't have much experience with it and I wonder what I should do about it, who to consult etc... Basically my very first time having a real anxiety episode was when my first child was born. It was right after months of over working at my job. I was under a LOT of stress, pressure to perform and long hours. I had clearly mismanaged and neglected my mental health during that time and it all came bursting out during my wife's giving birth to our firstborn. I had a huge panic attack. Felt like I had lost all control over my body and emotions for a good 2 hours minimum. After that I had nothing happen for like 1 year maybe 2. The 2nd time, it happened when again I was exerting myself at work. I was on a romantic getaway with my wife (although I should have taken a longer getaway... I needed 7 days of rest instead of the added stress of trying to compensate for months of exertion through a mere weekend of rest). I was at the movies with her and right in the middle of the movie I had a tachycardia. Heart went racing so much I thought I was going to have a heart attack for sure. I even took my phone out, prepared to dial 911 and told my wife to be ready to call them in case I truly had a heart attack. Turns out it was another panic attack... Again for about 3 hours I couldn't get control back of my emotional state... Didn't help that I had a LOT of caf√©ine prior to going in the movie theater plus the neglected stress overdose from work.... More recently I started doing a rather difficult job. The stress is different. It's not from too many hours it's from the multitude of very negative self esteem emotions it produces. Has to do with starting a business and the early parts have been tough. It's hard not to compare and feel like a failure to myself and my family. So this time around its very degrading negative emotions that are taking their toll... Potentially other health issues. I've had two or 3 other tachycardia episodes within the last 3 months. But they were lesser in intensity except the first one. The other big one is I've been getting food impactions randomly throughout the last 2 years. Happened maybe 10 times or so. Various intensity levels. But basically, I end up with a feeling stuck food in my throat. I can still breath just fine, but it takes some effort to get the food gown to my stomach. Obviously stress doesn't help during those events as it tightens the esophagus even more I suppose. So I've decided I really need to see a doctor soon because I don't know if these issues combined are real health issues from a physical problem (some heart condition or other) And I have no idea what to make of a my anxiety issues. My father is a retired army veteran who has PTSD. His situation is different but he can relate to some of the stuff I go through. I'd like to know if anyone here relates to what I just described and what you did about it to get better ‚ù§Ô∏è"

(Okay, so my bday is on a Tuesday after a four day weekend, fri-mon, and that‚Äôs when the trip took place) So in the beginning we talked about taking a trip all together. I was so excited! However, a few months before my bday everyone stopped mentioning it. Thought it was weird. Then, I found out then through another source that there was a different trip happening that no one told me about during the same time as the first trip that I was not invited to (during my birthday). I found this out about a month before my birthday and didn‚Äôt really know what to do because I didn‚Äôt want to overstep where I wasn‚Äôt invited. All I really wanted was for one of my friends to actually tell me straight up so I didn‚Äôt feel like I did something wrong or they hated me. I‚Äôve seen my friends since and they seemed normal, though I felt pretty down about the situation when I saw them, but I tried to bring it up a few times. No real conversations came of it, maybe they were avoiding it, and now it‚Äôs just been on the back of my mind. It makes me upset still, so I was wondering what I should do about it? I was really hoping one of them would have talked to me about it even after it happened, but no one has yet. Instead, they all asked if we could take a different trip to my cabin soon. Idk how to feel, as It‚Äôs still on my mind."

    "text": "Relationship Anxiety Hi there, I've sort of always had anxiety, with peaks and troughs, but more recently it seems to have spiralled. I used to have anxiety in my teens, which I most notably had spiralling negative thoughts \"what if I'm gay and dont know\" is an example of MANY. For the purposes of this post I am 100% straight, which is relevant below. I had lots of anxiety and stress at work, which was understandable with a clear cause. A change of job has largely removed this. But this seems to have brought a resurgence in more general anxiety. I have anxiety with driving, finding immense overwhelm when parking if people are about to witness. I even take longer journeys to avoid junctions or roads I believe I won't like. I had work anxiety like I mentioned above. And have in the past and more recently had anxiety in the forms of various \"what ifs\" or negative feelings. I even have anxiety in making this post, as it feels to admit some kind of abnormality or weakness (which of course I know is ridiculous in terms of trying to help myself and fix things). Most recently, I've had spiralling thoughts on my 5 year relationship with my girlfriend. To be clear, I feel happy and we are in a good place and she is my better half in a lot of ways. However, I have developed this fear of not being in love or not happy? It all feels confusing, I would say 95% of the time I love her to bits and feel happy. Then suddenly I get a negative thought, like \"what if we broke up\" or the \"what if I don't really love her\". I then spiral and I feel myself trying to convince myself that I do and why. Like I said before, I have always had various negative and anxious thoughts, some of which aren't how I am truly feeling. However it is so hard as I feel i dont know my own mind, and as a result im trying to convjnce myself or discover my true \"thoughts\". I'm not sure what to do with this, I don't want to break up and I don't want to question my relationship, and yet here I am spiralling trying to convince myself of that. Does anybody have this?"

    "text": "Anxiety feeds my depression and I spiral I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety a few times. But it started when I was in high school. Or the worst of it started in high school. I started having panic and anxiety attacks before school so severe I laid on the floor, dressed for school but unable to move, barely able to catch my breath and feeling like a complete and utter failure. After about two to three weeks of this I was pulled from the public school system, and later enrolled in an online public school a town over. Things settled down, I started medication and moved on with my life. Graduated high school and moved out of state when I was 18 with my then boyfriend. We got married and had two kids. I have stayed home with them since. My oldest is now seven and I started contract work about two to three weeks ago. At first the anxiety and panic attacks were less common, but still happened. I could find a way to calm myself and settle into the new normal of my job. But the last couple days? It feels like I‚Äôm stuck. My anxiety is filling me with panic, fear and dread. Then feeding my depression that I‚Äôm alone and I can fight or I can cave and let the world gobble me up. I had a panic attack two nights ago before bed. Dread from work and the inevitable of having I go to work. Then I woke up crying and shaking. Called in sick. Same routine for the last three days. But today I thought I could force myself to go to work and push through. I cried the whole drive ( which is an hour long). Sat in the parking lot for thirty minutes going in circles in my head. Anxiety telling me my kids are unhappy and struggling and it‚Äôs my fault. That the work day is going to get worse. That regardless of what I do I will inevitably cause harm to my husband. He works full time at the same place I am doing contract work. Then it feeds the depression. The depression reminds me I‚Äôm alone. That the schedule of our day doesn‚Äôt allow me to feel or process the anxiety. I just have to keep moving, but I‚Äôm weak and a coward. That my husband will leave me and I‚Äôm nothing. That k will never compare to the female coworkers that he has. There‚Äôs something wrong with me but I can‚Äôt fix it. That I‚Äôll never fix it. And I‚Äôll be stuck forever. That I‚Äôll always trap those around me. I‚Äôm just a burden to all those I care about. Then the anxiety ramps up again. That my husband will want to leave me because I have embarrassed him. Making everyone‚Äôs life more difficult and I‚Äôm failing at stepping up when I want and need to. That if I can‚Äôt do it now then I‚Äôll never be able to step up. I‚Äôm just stuck. I feel alone and like a failure and my mind won‚Äôt stop the circle cycle of anxiety -> depression -> anxiety -> depression."

    "text": "Anxiety Taking Me Over I am a 24 year old female with 2 kids and I am married. I have always had mild anxiety my entire life along with depression and ptsd but since Dec of 2024 I was smoking marijuana one night which I have always smoked but just that one night was different, I smoked and then my heart raced so fast and hard, I couldn‚Äôt breathe and my body was going numb, I for sure thought it was a heart attack but I went into an ambulance and i was told it was a panic attack, ever since then I thought I‚Äôd get better but I always felt the anxiety when trying to go out and I had another panic attack Feb 2025 and then another panic attack march and a small anxiety attack a few days ago. Now since that last panic attack everyday my chest and stomach always feel warm inside and I always have discomfort in my chest as if ima go into a panic or anxiety attack. All of the panic attacks has sent me to the ER for being scared of a heart attack. I don‚Äôt know how to handle it on my own. I‚Äôm trying meds but I believe they don‚Äôt work. I got a lot of bloodwork and test done and they come back normal so I guess it‚Äôs nothing that I‚Äôm thinking like cancer or anything else. However I feel so much physical pains like joint pains, back pains, stomach pains, head pressure, some weightloss, sometimes I gain but I also lose again when my stomach pain gets bad and diarrhea. Anxiety is taking over my life. A lot of times noise can trigger me like it stresses me out and gives me discomfort in my chest. A lot of times though nothing can be going on and my body is anxious, it takes me over and it‚Äôs tiring. Can Anyone else relate?"

    "text": "Surviving is a struggle and I hate people If there‚Äôs one thing life has humbled me with time and again, it‚Äôs how difficult it is to survive as a person from a broken home who‚Äôs trying to find love / hope. And it‚Äôs not because you‚Äôre particularly unlucky, but because you simply don‚Äôt believe you can win. Life has never given it you in a platter and you grow up seeing how scarce your life is even in terms of resources that aren‚Äôt even that hard to find or be provided with. My parents have had an unhappy marriage their entire life, one where you can visibly see how tired they are of each other and are only continuing because they decided to have ‚Äúkids‚Äù. You learn to perceive yourself as a liability in such homes before you could even learn what it means. I was the older kid in that household which means my parents definitely did a better job with my younger sibling than they did with me. Being born felt like the wrong thing to do and growing up felt like a struggle. I could never trust people by sharing what happens at home because my parents had an ‚Äúimage‚Äù to maintain. I‚Äôm not sure how much truth am I revealing even now but I‚Äôm trying. And it‚Äôs less for the viewers and more for my own satisfaction that I didn‚Äôt keep all of this to myself. That someone knows. That someone somewhere might be going through something similar and maybe this post tells them life is hard and it would continue to be hard but you‚Äôve got you and that‚Äôs all that matters on most days. My life has particularly been hard across aspects (family, studies, love, job). When u started venturing out of my home I was 17, I chose the college farthest from home because that was the only way of getting away from the toxicity which focusing on what could be relied on in the future ‚Äî my education. I got bullied a month into college for being different. I was an introvert, always into myself, didn‚Äôt talk much and often appeared distressed due to the environment of constant fights I had come from. I had my hostel roommates boycott me and call me names. I had a senior in college who liked me, lack of people in my life u needed to survive lead me to agree to a relationship with him. He was five years older to me and that should tell you a lot about how dominated I was in that relationship. He asked for my Facebook password, changed my relationship status, mentioned his name on my profile, and unfriended all the guys on my profile. And I was so weak, that I couldn‚Äôt even confront him about this. I knew he won‚Äôt listen and might retaliate. So I did what most girls would ‚Äî forgot about it. A year passed by and I was banned from talking to any guy in college. If I did, it was met with allegations and blames of me trying to get attention. I survived that relationship with zero friends. Again a toxic ground that I couldnt talk to people about. Six months later, I heard from a friend that he was found kissing some girl at a party last night (a party he advised me to not come to). Obviously that friend told others about it too (gossip travels fast in college) and people started coming to me to tell me about more incidents like these where he did things with other girls over the past two years. I was distraught, once again had no one to go to, and couldn‚Äôt see what tomorrow would look like. Thankfully I had some friends who had gotten better friends over the course of the college who supported me through it and who I‚Äôm indebted to for life. My boyfriend kept on denying these allegations until he finally accepted them a year down the line. He pursued me and the relationship further for two more years until he finally gave up. I think something inside me that was carrying hope also broke with that relationship and it has only been breaking more the more encounters I have with guys and people. I think the society demands you to wear a certain face to participate in it and be deemed as ‚Äúyou belong‚Äù. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs my inability to wear that face or disapproval to the concept, I feel like I dont fit in. And that takes the joy out of living? Not fitting in? Animals bring me more joy than humans do. I at my core, detest humans and I‚Äôm not sure if this could be a successful way to go about life. Id be a miserable human and hence a more toxic one if this school of thought isn‚Äôt challenged. This does give me anxiety, like it‚Äôs being in a group you know you secretly hate. Navigating in a world you know no one would ever understand you in. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs my series of experiences or conditioning that makes me the way I am. If you are me, what helps you go through life knowing people are shit and all of this is pointless?"

    "text": "Looking for any tips/ advice to help with driving anxiety, especially when driving alone TLDR: I recently got my driving license and more recently a car, but I feel quite anxious to drive especially since I‚Äôm now doing it alone (learned with a driving instructor as I didn‚Äôt have access to a car otherwise). Any tips or advice for before, during and after a drive, would be greatly appreciated! Thanks! ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî For some of context, at the end of last year I finally got my driving license and more recently a car. I say finally as I‚Äôm 27 and knowingly delayed learning to drive due to the anxiety of both driving in general and the process of getting a license. I had started learning to drive at 18, but when I moved away for uni, instead of continuing I convinced myself that I was too busy, which was partly true, but not entirely. I‚Äôm still really proud that I took the steps to get my license despite the delay! I passed the theory a year earlier, delayed starting the practical training by about 6 months, then started learning with a driving instructor (as I don‚Äôt have access to a car), and eventually passed the driving exam on my first try! I was so anxious for my first driving lesson that I contacted the school to reiterate that it‚Äôd be my first time driving. They of course reassured me that it would be fine, and the instructor was really good and supportive throughout! I definitely know that the hardest part is getting started and that the more I drive, the more comfortable I‚Äôll be. BUT, my issue is that I‚Äôm now doing this alone. Well obviously it was always going to come to this, but having an instructor next to me made me feel less anxious. I know I need to be calm while driving, but even the thought of getting into the car and driving somewhere is causing me to feel anxious. Like even now I‚Äôve been thinking of going out to run some errands for the last few hours, but the uncertainty of things is making me think that I should take a bus instead and while there scope out the area for how I‚Äôd do it with a car. I‚Äôve currently only driven about twice since getting a car. My main areas of anxiety include: 1) Attempting to drive in/out of my apartment‚Äôs parking garage (the ramp seems so narrow and yet two cars should supposedly be able to drive up/down next to each). 2) Parking in a bay especially between two cars (I never learned how to do this which is strange since I‚Äôd probably do it a lot more than parallel park). 3) Parking in general (if I drive anywhere I‚Äôll need to park, but where and how does it work? What if I drive into a carpark and there‚Äôs an issue and I‚Äôm stuck? What if I don‚Äôt find a space? Do I just go home?). 4) Turning into or from a side road where you need to wait until it‚Äôs safe to do so (in approaching where I‚Äôd want to turn, I feel like I‚Äôll start thinking ‚Äòwhat if I never find a gap?‚Äô or ‚Äòwhat if I can‚Äôt actually turn here?‚Äô or ‚Äòwhat if I cause a hold up of cars?‚Äô). There‚Äôs probably some other things too, but again I‚Äôve only actually driven twice so I‚Äôm not sure. I know overthinking definitely doesn‚Äôt help either. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! I really enjoyed driving while I was learning, and I think I would enjoy it more if I wasn‚Äôt so anxious. I‚Äôve procrastinated going out long enough, so I‚Äôm going to try go out now. Honestly if I get out of the parking garage alone (and get back down), I‚Äôd take it as a win! Sure it‚Äôs not ideal, but at this point I‚Äôd consider it a success compared to not going at all! I just hope I actually do it since I‚Äôm starting to feel the hesitation return at the thought of going."

But over the past few months, my anxiety has come back hard, to the point where I struggle to leave the house. On top of that, I‚Äôve had stomach issues since September, which makes me terrified of being out in public in case something happens. I recently restarted Prozac to help, but I‚Äôm still in the early stages of treatment. A close friend of mine is getting married later this year, and I‚Äôm in his groom‚Äôs party. He invited me to his bachelor party next month, and I said yes. I even booked my flights, thinking I‚Äôd be able to push through. But as the trip gets closer, I realize I‚Äôm not in a place mentally where I can handle traveling, socializing, and being away from home. He just reached out to confirm my plans, and I‚Äôm torn. I don‚Äôt want to be a flake, but I also don‚Äôt want to force myself into a situation that could make my anxiety worse. At the same time, I know avoidance only reinforces agoraphobia, so I feel guilty for backing out. Should I cancel now and be honest with my friend?

    "text": "Audio Hallucinations Hello So long story short I have had anxiety all my teen years and adult life. Recently in the past 5 years I also been suffering from horrible disturbing intrusive thoughts and images üíî I was on sertraline for a few years , slowly came off it as I was going well but recently I have a relapse of anxiety and depression and I have started sertlaine again. Recently leading up to the relapse I have had issues with audio hallucinations , they all relate to the intrusive thoughts. IMPORTANT I know they are not real or true at all. I don't have paranoia or any delusions or think it actually happened . They really distress me when they happen because I know these things didn't happen. When I spoke to the doctors they said this was due to high anxiety , low depression and high stress etc causing this to happen to me. Since starting the Sertaline( 1 week) I have been experiencing insomnia( sleep is currently 4 to 5 hours) high anxiety still and the audio hallucinations are starting to concern me. Here is what I have been experiencing. -Hearing a certain intruisve thought in my head through audio around me , for example listening to radio and I hear the intrusive thought in the music or -Having sudden intrusive images of things happening in front of me when I know it didn't actually happen . -Whispered intrusive thoughts in my head . -Sat next to someone and then hearing a intruisve though in their voice like \"M your a bad person\" Also I have had some horrid intrusive thoughts when I lie down to go to sleep. I don't hear these in voices. \"Hello M we're the voices in your head \" \"Hello M your a bad person like me \" I KNOW THESE THINGS DIDNT ACTUALLY HAPPEN OR ARE REAL AT ALL . THEY REALLY DISTRESS ME WHEN THEY HAPPEN AND IM GETTING WORRIED. My mind keeps telling me I am going insane/crazy and keeps talking about psychosis and other things. I'm getting concerned now as I want these things to stop as they are distressing me and scaring me frankly. No assholes or trolls please! I keep telling myself these are just anxiety and intrusive thoughts and that it's just anxiety playing tricks on me. Any techniques to help me would be appreciated!"

I started having anxiety/panic attacks a couple of years ago and realized that I have to accept it to move forward with my life & in the last year or two it‚Äôs calmed down a lot for me (cut down on drinking a lot) still have those negative thoughts in the back on my mind but I remember that I used to be someone that has always had great mental strength & been able to push past any challenges that I have came across so it‚Äôs hard to bend a knee to anxiety and let it take over my life. I know some of my triggers are caffeine & not being able to freely move around examples are sitting in a barber chair / airplane seat or being in a meeting where I have to stay seated & still for a period of time but I still do these things knowing that I will feel anxious. What has helped me stay strong in the moment is staying healthy & getting blood work done and checked by your doctor to make sure that everything is fine with me so I know that when I feel terrible/anxious I know that it‚Äôs anxiety and it will pass, also I wouldn‚Äôt consider myself a very religious person but I like to pray in the mornings & I believe that having faith can help keep a positive attitude and outlook on certain situations. Is anybody else going about anxiety like this ?"

I am near certain with 2 neighbours next to me and one above me from my kitchen space who have never confronted me about noise, that it's just them doing there own things, but it bothers me so much, especially when it sounds like banging. I sometimes purposely close a cupboard door or my cutlery draw when leaving my kitchen as a statement to a unlikely retaliation game being played. I know often wear earplugs whenever I will be doing anything productive in my kitchen space to spare me getting irritated, which works well but is a unfortunate thing to feel the need to do. This is more a vent, as I expect asking my neighbours if I am making too much noise is all I can do to put me at ease. Is there anybody else who has similar experiences and what do or did you do to not care and get bothered by it anymore."

Or just taking a deep breath in general. It‚Äôll be back to back and at first I thought nothing of it because I‚Äôve been so exhausted and haven‚Äôt really been hydrating. Today I had enough and went to urgent care to run everything by them and have my heart and lungs checked out. I didn‚Äôt want to just be brushed off as ‚ÄúOh you just have anxiety‚Äù. The physical exam checked out and I was advised to take it easy, easier said than done. I‚Äôve been extremely stressed at work, my dogs been sick and I‚Äôve been apartment hunting and it‚Äôs just been a lot on me. I‚Äôve never had this last more than like an hour. Has anyone experienced this? What have you done to help you stop focusing on it and control it? I hope how I‚Äôm explaining makes senses. It‚Äôs like a continuous need to catch my breath for that deep relief you feel when you get it. I do have Xanax but at this point I really just want it to stop. Sorry for such a long post."

They always appear slightly different each time too, so I never know if it's in fact something new or just anxiety. I wish I could just know the cause of each symptom when I get it, like I just wish I knew what the fuck was happening every time. The worse part is that if I didn't have the symptoms I'd be functioning completely well. It's just these same sensations holding me back everyday. It doesn't help that I'm emetophobic as fuck, so I'm constantly checking my body for signs that I might be sick"

    "text": "Do my friends tolerate me? For as long as I can remember, my biggest source of anxiety has been how I think my friends see me. Whenever I am with them I judiciously review every interaction I have with them. Mercilessly casting shade at myself for even the slightest self-perceived missteps. It leads to among other things to self-depreciating humor which is a sort of venting mechanism but only reinforces the negative thoughts and is most likely a drag on all conversations. I value their presence in my life, and I know they wouldn‚Äôt bother if they didn‚Äôt on some small level appreciate me. Still, my biggest fear has always been rejection on a personal basis. Someone saying I am either annoying or not good enough. I can handle the day to day, but I would appreciate any new insights before it becomes intolerable. Does anyone else here face similar struggles and if so, how do you handle them? Do you think I should be doing anything differently?"

    "text": "Desperately need advice on career I am 29F, introvert, and my financial conditions aren't great. Currently, i work from home, but the job doesn't pay as much as it should. And the growth options are limited because i live in a city with limited employment opportunities (at least in the field that i am working in currently), and i can't move to another city. I am at a stage in life where i need financial stability. There is a job opportunity that may give me financial stability to some extent. There are other pros also. For example, i have worked at that organization previously and know many people there. Those people are all friendly and helpful, and that organization was very good to me. So, the problem is: that job is a teaching job. And teaching has felt very alien to me. Idk why. I used to feel like i have been placed in an alien land when i was put in the middle of kids. I did my job decently at that time, but i don't think i have the empathy or extrovertedness required for teaching. Additionally, this position is a higher position than the position i worked at previously, so the responsibilities would be much higher. I don't know whether i should apply for this opportunity. I feel extremely anxious about the changes in my life that will happen if i get the job. I am also worried whether i will be able to do the job well enough and whether i will be happy. On the flipside, i know that if i get this job, i will have financial stability and many of my problems would improve. Lately, i have been feeling like i am failing the people around me. They think that i can do so much, but i don't feel like doing anything other than wake up, do my current job, eat, meet friends sometimes, and go to sleep. This lack of ambition is killing me. I see people around me chasing money left, right, and centre. I want to do that too but i don't do anything for it. People tell me that i am stuck in my comfort zone and that i need to get out of it to do better things. Deep down, i think they are right. For a long time, i didn't feel the need to change anything in my life. But lately, i am feeling like i must bring a change, at least career wise. My mother is getting old; i need to be financially stable to give her a good life. So, i am wondering whether i should apply for that job, even though i might not enjoy it. Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you for taking the time to read this long post."

    "text": "What helps you from spiraling into delusional thinking? I have frequent negative and delusion thinking that I know doesn‚Äôt make any sense but in the moment it‚Äôs terrifying. Just for example, my brain convinced me last night that the floor was not real, I was in a movie, my family wasn‚Äôt real, and the world was ending. I felt like I was sinking into the ground below me and I couldn‚Äôt understand how the world could be real. I felt like I was in like an apocalypse. My pretty frequent anxiety attack is my brain will constantly tell me I‚Äôm going to throw up as I am emetophobic. This happens everyday, multiple times a day. Sometimes it will last all day, sometimes it comes and goes. I have never had a day without it, though. I have had addiction problems in the past so I really don‚Äôt wish to be on any type of sedative like xanax. I take effexor, clondine for sleeping, and buspirone from time to time. They are helpful. I rarely have panic attacks but I would say that the anxiety attacks are worse for me. It‚Äôs also hard because it‚Äôs mainly just my thinking that causes it and no medication can make me stop thinking. I try to be around friends and family, but my brain tells me they aren‚Äôt real and also I don‚Äôt like stressing others. I had a boyfriend who used to scream at me and physically attack me for crying or having panic attacks so it‚Äôs really hard to talk to others about it. I try to fill my mind with something else like coloring or playing a game but it‚Äôs really hard when your brain is telling you that you are actively dying and you start having those classic symptoms like dizziness, nausea, and heart palpations. It‚Äôs like I have a parasite in my brain that is constantly telling me things that I know aren‚Äôt true and that make no sense. I feel like sometimes I‚Äôm going into psychosis like I‚Äôm losing reality. I know that isn‚Äôt true. I have severe PTSD so not feeling like I‚Äôm in reality has been half my life, but it never gets less terrifying somehow. I‚Äôm not depressed but I feel so stuck in this that I would rather die than feel like this for the rest of my life. For the first time, I want to live and do better but, it feels like my brain doesn‚Äôt want me to. I want to go to therapy so bad, but I live in a small town with every counseling or therapy office around on a 6 month-1 year waiting list or they just aren‚Äôt taking new patients. Is there any advice or tips that have helped you? Honestly even if you don‚Äôt have any advice, just telling me you understand would be helpful. I feel so alone. I‚Äôve never met or seen anybody with anxiety as bad as mine."

    "text": "My experience with severe anxiety. Hi all, I thought I would share my experience as a 16 year old girl with diagnosed GAD (generalised anxiety disorder) and PD (panic disorder). I understand how intense and traumatic it can be to live in such a state of mind, and how often it‚Äôs underestimated. I hope this brings comfort to anyone going through anxiety, and that it gives those blessed with mental stability an idea of how debilitating it can be for someone with mental health problems. It all started when I was around 8-9, I remember I would often have episodes of derealisation. For those who don‚Äôt know what it is, it‚Äôs essentially when your brain clocks out, everything feels like a dream; a haze, fight or flight mode, an out of body experience. If you smoke weed or drink alcohol, you can grasp the idea of derealisation. I would have quite severe episodes of derealisation, it literally felt like I did ketamine at times, and that was one of the symptoms of my anxiety. Another symptom I had was that I was delusional, that something out of the ordinary was a bad omen. Here‚Äôs an example: I once walked into the kitchen and spotted a cloth with blood on it, a normal person would think nothing of it, I mean, it‚Äôs a kitchen lol. My delusional self thought it was a sign of death, I immediately had a panic attack, I couldn‚Äôt breathe, I felt pumped full of drugs, I remember begging to be taken to hospital whilst everyone laughed at me, genuinely felt like I was in a horror movie. So you can imagine how bad my anxiety was, panic attacks, derealisation, and delusion. Now due to other issues I was put on antipsychotics and muscle relaxers at the age of 10 which put my anxiety to rest. From then on my anxiety was put to rest, I still knew I had it but it was much more manageable, until the summer of 2024. I‚Äôm not sure what triggered it, stress, maybe the fact I hadn‚Äôt taken my meds for years, I have no clue. All I remember is that I first started to hyper fixate on my skin, I would search for bumps, or any weird spots. There ended up being red blotch on my skin which triggered an obsession with skin cancer. Weeks later I had an ear infection, the words ‚Äúsepsis‚Äù and ‚Äúbrain infection‚Äù flooded my mind. I saw a girl on TikTok with a fatal motor neuron disease known as ‚ÄúALS‚Äù, and I immediately started fixating on my hand grip and symptoms associated with said disease. Weeks passed and it became worse, I experienced fatigue, I had become more anxious, and had to sleep with my mum at times. But nothing could‚Äôve prepared me for what happened a few months later. After summer ended, I moved to a new home, and that‚Äôs when shit started going down. I was petrified of cancer, I had panic attacks every night, EXTREME derealisation, brain fog, tension headaches, and just a complete change of mental state. The worst part is that this went on for a month before it got unbearable, I genuinely thought this was as bad as it could get, but boy was I wrong. 9:30pm, early/mid October, I suddenly had a panic attack that lasted 5 hours. All I can remember is that my brain didn‚Äôt feel right, that I thought I was having a psychotic break, that I was going to die. I spent hours rocking back and forth in my mums bed as she took care of me, it was so horrific. The next day I was completely bed bound, I didn‚Äôt sleep the whole night. For the next 3 weeks I would have 2-3 panic attacks a day, I would have the most intense physical and mental symptoms. This included: Physical ‚Ä¢ Vomiting ‚Ä¢ diarrhoea ‚Ä¢ trembling ‚Ä¢ constant urination ‚Ä¢ chest pains ‚Ä¢ abdominal pain ‚Ä¢ blurry vision ‚Ä¢ headaches ‚Ä¢ muscle tension Mental ‚Ä¢ Hallucinations (visual, sensual, and taste) ‚Ä¢ Impending doom ‚Ä¢ panic attacks ‚Ä¢ delusion ‚Ä¢ brain fog ‚Ä¢ memory loss ‚Ä¢ general depression + SO MUCH MORE. I could go on and on about how horrible my experiences were, this is just the tip of the iceberg. But I figured it‚Äôs getting too long and the idea of this was to be of reassurance. If you are struggling with something like this, just know that anxiety can present itself in such severe forms, it‚Äôs not a silly, teenage girl illness, any severe mental illness is bound to severely affect someone. With that being said, there is hope. I spent 5 months in such a horrific state, some have managed to survive YEARS. I‚Äôm not there yet, but I‚Äôve gotten better, Zoloft has really helped me, as well as support from my family and friends, and obviously reading similar experiences on Reddit. I promise things get better, and once it does those awful experiences will be buried. Take care of yourself for now, take your meds, drink something, and just know that so many people are struggling with the same thing."

None have worked. I'm on 25 mgs and feel slightly off. Hard to describe. The craziest thing though is for the first time in years I feel like I don't give a fuck about what people think of me. I'm able to look them in the eyes and not feel constantly judged. I know it's not placebo and it's only day 2. I plan on staying on 25 mg and combining it with therapy, weightlifting and reading CBD. As long as zoloft doesn't wreck my sex drive I'll stay on it. Did anyone else have my experience or something similar?"

    "text": "AITA for Feeling Drained by My Best Friend's Negativity and Self-Inflicted Problems? Hello everyone, for starters, I‚Äôm 23F, and my best friend is also 24F. We‚Äôve been best friends since early elementary school, and I‚Äôm almost done with college now. I really feel bad for thinking and feeling this way because my best friend has always been good to me and my family. She‚Äôs always been there for me, going above and beyond, and spoiling me, really. She‚Äôs gotten us many gifts on all special occasions like birthdays and Christmas and is close with my family. The issue is that my best friend can be a very negative person, and I‚Äôm the type of person whose mood is affected by the people around me. I grew up as the eldest child in a family whose parents hate each other but stay together ‚Äúfor the kids,‚Äù so I always felt like I had to fix everyone‚Äôs problems and moods. This led to me developing really bad anxiety and a people-pleasing personality. Surprisingly, I think that‚Äôs why I got along so well with my best friend since she didn‚Äôt have a good family growing up either. She‚Äôs been through so much‚Äîone of her parents isn‚Äôt in her life, and she‚Äôs been through toxic relationships, etc. We practically text every day, but lately, over the last couple of weeks, I‚Äôve felt like she hasn‚Äôt wanted to talk to me or just gets annoyed with anything I have to say or tell her. She doesn‚Äôt like when I ‚Äúoffer solutions‚Äù to her problems or try to help her out of a negative mindset or even with financial decisions. She constantly makes bad decisions for herself, like dating people who aren‚Äôt good for her, going into debt, wrecking multiple cars, and spending all her money on fast food and shopping. Then she complains about how everything is expensive and how she doesn‚Äôt have money, blaming it on her job. While they don‚Äôt pay her much, she doesn‚Äôt even try budgeting, and whenever me or her grandparents tell her this, she gets annoyed and says she can‚Äôt because it‚Äôs little money. At this point, I‚Äôm really tired of her complaining, especially since most of her problems are self-inflicted. Yet, she continues to complain about how the universe hates her. I really can‚Äôt stand it anymore; I can‚Äôt have a conversation with her without her turning it into something negative. She also has terrible insecurity issues. I feel bad because she‚Äôs been going through a lot of health issues and is worried about that, but over the years, she‚Äôs been in and out of hospitals because of her anxiety. No matter who she sees, they tell her she‚Äôs fine and that her anxiety is making her believe she‚Äôs having a heart attack or stroke or that something‚Äôs wrong with her heart, seizures, etc. Whenever I tell her she‚Äôs a hypochondriac, she gets pissed and complains that no one understands her. I really try; I really do, but she‚Äôs very stubborn, and honestly, it feels like she‚Äôs the one who won‚Äôt listen to anyone else around her. We‚Äôve also had conversations about relationships before, and she will continuously tell me that my idea of love is unrealistic because I want someone who‚Äôs loyal and who doesn‚Äôt participate in hookup culture, someone who thinks of those things as something special, who can hold a conversation and be open and vulnerable with you‚Äînot someone closed off who can‚Äôt communicate, etc. She thinks that because I read so many romance books, my idea of love is fantasy and that real people aren‚Äôt like that. She also criticizes my ex for how he treated me (and he wasn‚Äôt a peach‚Äîhe ghosted me a lot and made me feel crappy), but when I point out that her boyfriend and exes are worse, she gets upset with me. I just don‚Äôt like feeling like she thinks I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm talking about, or that she‚Äôs smarter than me or knows more and invalidates anything I say to her. And if you‚Äôre going to complain about it, what should I do?"

And then they mention abt how intrusive thoughts defines them and all. Which they have their own reason why and i respect that. But idk if it is going to misunderstand the whole meaning of what intrusive thought is or not ( Unless i have misunderstood in in the first place ). But idk everything abt other ppls lives so yeah. So im curious, what do you think intrusive thought are to you. Does it define you, or not. Tell me you opinions and why you think that? Id like to know!"

I (18m) have been experiencing a ton of severe panic attacks lately and I don‚Äôt understand why and was wondering how I could prevent them if possible. I‚Äôve always had anxiety, I‚Äôve never bothered trying to get a diagnosis for an anxiety disorder but I‚Äôve noticed that recently I‚Äôve been experiencing a lot of panic attacks, I went from having a panic attack once every couple of years to having them multiple times a week. Last month I averaged 3 panic attacks a week, three weeks ago I had 6, two of twice were on the same day and since when I‚Äôve averaged one a day. Today I was on the London tube with my girlfriend going from Oxford Circus to Finsbury Park, while on the busy train I randomly had got hit with probably the worst panic attack I‚Äôve ever experienced, I struggled to keep myself up as I was unable to sit down because again the train carriage was packed. As soon as we got off the train I immediately collapsed onto the floor, lost all awareness of my surroundings and I couldn‚Äôt hear anything other than my racing heart beat and my intense breathing Thankfully I had my girlfriend with me who did her best to comfort me through physical contact as that would was the only way that I was able to process that I wasn‚Äôt alone, apparently a few people stopped to try talk to me but again I lost all spatial awareness so I wasn‚Äôt even aware that they were there. I felt like I was trapped in a small dark box, I felt extremely claustrophobic and also felt like I was suffocating. would there be any reason to why I‚Äôm experiencing these panic attacks especially on such a regular basis? And how can I make them stop?"

For the heart, I've gotten more EKGs in the past 2 months than the average person probably gets in their lifetime, blood tests that show normal Troponin levels, a super healthy cholestrol, normal sodium levels, chext x-rays that are normal, and an MRI of my chest as well (and guess what, also normal). Doctors have listened to my heart and lungs and they mention it sounds fine. And the fact that my chest pains are musculoskeltal since I was diagnosed with costochondritis and my PT noticed my pecs were super duper tight. And I'm seeing a cardiologist in about two weeks for a comprehensive look at my cardiovascular system to hopefully receive full closure In spite of ALL This evidence, I still am horrifically anxious over my heart to the point where I'm always placing my hand over my chest to feel my pulse, I'm touching my chest a lot, etc. my musculoskeletal aches and pains are making me super duper anxious I'll just collapse of a heart attack or that I have heart condition.

I found a work from home job and am finally getting on meds and doing therapy. my anxiety is mainly health/travel related. I tried celexa and that was awful so switch to lexapro (only 3 weeks in) prescribed by my gp. gp suggested psych for medication management and honestly I was on board bc I can do telehealth rather than going back to my gp‚Äôs office all the time. well I had my intake tonight and at first I left the session not knowing how to feel, she said some good things and some things I did not like at all. I don‚Äôt agree with one of the medications she put me on (tried to add cymbalta to lexapro) and wanted me to try propranolol. I was excited to try the propranolol until I read it is contraindicated with asthma which she knew i had. however the thing I‚Äôm upset with the most, she criticized my health issues and suggested there was something more wrong with me. I have eczema, asthma, and allergies and she kept suggesting that I need to see a rheumatologist. I‚Äôve had plenty of tests run by my gp and gastro doctor and neither are concerned right now about autoimmune disorders. at first I left the session agreeing with her that I needed to make appointments to see more doctors, and now I‚Äôm laying here realizing she reignited my health anxiety when tbh it hasnt been too bad on the lexapro. I‚Äôm so upset now that this woman took my valid concerns about health anxiety and almost used them against me. I don‚Äôt want to see her again and not sure how to proceed. so upset with myself for letting her get to me too. has anyone ever experienced this?"

I was diagnosed with a chronic dermatitis where the capillaries in my legs burst and leave coin shaped red marks on my skin. For most, as is for my case, the issue is benign. Not much is known about the condition but, the first course of action is rebuilding the capillaries. The best supplements are Vitamin C 500mg and Rutocide (or Rutin) 50mg, both twice a day. I‚Äôve been taking both for three weeks now and the progress is slow, but it works. The Rutocide, however, has terrible side effects like nervousness, fast heart rate, swelling legs, swelling joints, water buildup in the knees, joint pain, nervousness, and dizziness. I was fine until last week when all of these side effects hit me at once. I had surgery in 2022 that caused me to go into urosepsis. I was in the hospital for four days until my fever and tremors finally went down. I‚Äôve had health anxiety ever since. In 2023, I had another surgery that left me fighting a UTI for four months. I‚Äôm 37 years old now and, every twitch, pain, swelling, hollow feeling‚Ä¶ it keeps reminding me that I am getting older and my body is deteriorating. I eat well; I work out; I‚Äôm healthy.

For example one time I was getting a haircut and it looked so shit that it tweaked me out and all of a sudden my whole body was itching even my face!

No offense to those with anxiety but I just kinda always thought anxiety happened to kids who were quiet and not rly outgoing when they got put in bad situations so I have no clue what‚Äôs wrong w me.

    "text": "Dizziness Hey guys, I am new on the channel yet not that new with anxiety :D But recently I have started to have symptoms that I never had before. So like 6 months ago I was in a nail salon, everything was fine, I was in a good mood, and suddenly I felt like a weird \"rush\", kind of a wave from my head to my legs while sitting, and then extremely fast heart beat for couple of minutes. I called ambulance and had very high blood pressure but EKG was fine. Maybe it was arrythmia, I don't know. Took a while to get over it but I kind of did. Now, ten days ago I was running, again everything was fine, beautiful day, and I slow down the run, start walking and all of a sudden I feel extremely dizzy, and fast heart beat again. I had to sit down in the park. It again calmed down but after this I have been extremely scared, anxious ... Two days ago I was in front of laptop, sitting at home, and out of the blue I started feeling dizzy, world spinning. I went to lay down and it just was getting worse, I was super scared, I felt I was high on something (but not in a good way) and the heart rate was over 100. I called an ambulance, I started getting very cold, trembling, spinning feeling in the head. Ambulance came, everything was fine, it started to go better after. My partner gave me a mild xanax and after this I was almost normal but shaken. I tend to get these dizziness rushes daily now, and again just now I got dizziness feeling, my chest feels heavy, a bit heavy to breathe, hands feel heavy and I feel I am not completely in this universe, like just a weird feeling. Head is heavy. Heart beat is fine. I did some anxiety breathing exercise and just try to tell myself everything is fine and I won't die but I don't like the progression of these symptoms. Sorry if this message was messy explanation but I hope to find some support. Do you experience similar symptoms ? What do you do to stop them or just wait for it to go away ? This is fucking annoying and I hate to be scared and \"on the edge\" all the time now. Have a nice evening <3"

I have experienced some of the worst days of my life (for at the time what seemed like no reason). I have GAD and panic disorder and have struggled with both of these for years but it recently became much more intense since I stopped working to finish school. It got to the point where I knew I needed to seek help because I was not okay. The first medication I tried which was pristiq made me feel even worse from the side effects. The next medication I tried which was propanalol seemed like night and day. I felt ‚Äúcured‚Äùuntil today. Today marks one week since taking it. After feeling like I was over this dark phase in my life I felt it creep back today and it wouldn‚Äôt go away. I had to cancel on the family I was supposed to babysit for today and felt so bad because my anxiety has been so bad. I am trying to look at this as just a small setback but it was extremely discouraging to cancel on them. I thought I would be okay to go babysit and just feel so guilty too. I‚Äôm also worried this will become more than just a small setback. There were times in the last few months where my anxiety was at a 10 for days on end. I am worried this is the start of one of those long episodes. I was also supposed to start therapy last week but the therapist had an emergency and we can‚Äôt start until this week. I just want to feel like me again, this entire process of improving my mental health has been so exhausting and unpredictable."

    "text": "Falling down and getting up I had a pretty bad anxious episode today but got through it. Wanted to share, both in the shittines and success. I was at a coffee shop and felt my inner alarm going off, no real reason I could think of. Felt the panic rising. I get hot, sweaty, bad stomach, light headed, spiked heartrate. (One of my worst fears when things like this happen is that I will shit my pants) Was plotting my escape, the bathroom or run to my car and leave. Felt trapped, overwhelmed, that everyone knew I was freaking out inside. I was able to focus on my breathing, recognizing the intrusive thoughts, grounding in my body, trying to be compassionate towards myself...And the feelings started to ease off, slowly deescalating. I recently had been feeling better and doing a lot of things that a few years prior didn't feel possible with my level of anxiety. After this episode passed my reaction was to be pretty bummed. Like I had regressed and moved backwards. But I know the goal isn't to make it go away completely but be able to move through it. And the small success of that is worth celebrating. I stayed at the Cafe, I wanted to prove to myself I was safe, that it was my head tricking me. All that is to say that I see you all, anxiety is horrible, it robs you of your identity, personality, of enjoying life. And it sucks feeling like you're constantly fighting yourself. I've been working on it, been in therapy for years and the progress can feel excruciatingly slow. But it's possible to move through, to manage. I hope for you all and me that the good days outnumber the bad."

    "text": "I've never been medicated/scared to take medications Hello, I was told by a former therapist I have moderate to severe generalized anxiety disorder. I am currently in behavioral therapy. Basically, I am too anxious to take medication for it. I'm 34 and never been prescribed anything for anxiety or otherwise, other than my medical cannabis card. If it's not too intrusive, may I ask what exactly certain medications may be beneficial for anxiety? And what the actual feeling is when it's taken? Do you just...stop having intrusive thoughts? Is your mood lifted? Do you experience severe side effects? If you get off of it, will it cause mental damage and make anxiety worse? Are the physical symptoms of anxiety reduced? Are you more social? I just want to know people's experiences, if you're willing to share. For more context about my issues, I suffer from ruminating thoughts, trouble focusing and being present, forgetfulness, impending doom feelings, physical symptoms sometimes (fast heartbeat, sweaty, panic, pacing or staying frozen). I have never been diagnosed with OCD but I believe I have a form of it as well. But therapy is not working. Mindfulness, exercise, consuming happy content, unplugging, focusing on hobbies, getting sleep, all that other stuff people say helps, is very much not helping. I may need to try medication."

    "text": "Struggling (if you've seen this alot before and are getting annoyed, please just block me, not trying to annoy anyone, just trying to cope as much as I can.) I'm a 17 year old guy. I already have a plan to get out of this neglectful filthy environment. In currently studying my drivings test and planning on getting a car and my driver's license with my parents by the time I turn 18, and when I'm 18, I'm immediately applying to job corps to catch up on the years of school I'm behind on, but I'm mainly going to be able to get out of this environment asap. But I'm still very worried because the ONE disease I'm having anxiety about is of course the most rare incurable disease out there, Prions. Please don't click off yet. I'm not an idiot, I realize how rare this disease is. But my environment that consists of being a very unsanitary farm with dog and cat feces and urine present in and outside the house constantly, unvaccinated animals, AND irresponsible parents that don't feed COWS we have correctly, which is literally where you most commonly get prions from an environment, my fears are atleast valid. My arm has been twitching recently sometimes, and body twitching is a symptom so obviously I'm even more worried. And my memory is lowkey bad. The house is so fucking filthy. And since we don't have fixed cats and dogs, there is literally dog period blood just on the floor as I'm walking around the house. And since the many big dogs we have in the house are untrained, we let them use the bathroom on 4 puppy pads that are washed in the washer we all use for laundry. I'm so uncomfortable I don't touch anything outside of my own room without washing my hands. I only eat the food I prepare so I make sure everything that touches it is clean, and I genuinely don't feel hopeful or happy for the future. I'm convinced I'm going to die before I get to leave this place. I'm pretty convinced there's a chance I have prions, and I'm just hoping if I do the incubation period is long enough so after turn 18 I can go get tested and see if I can test if I have prions so I can begin treatment before prions start to damage me, but with how long I've been living in this place, I feel like I'm going to start dying soon. I get it's rare. 1/6000 people get it. But living in an environment like this, irresponsible parents, plus with cows getting into coops/and maybe being fed the wrong food that's not specifically for cows, I don't see how I won't be the 1/6000. I'm probably not going to stop worrying about prions until I get tested, but until then, I hope anyone here can give me some good news that's something other than \"it's rare.\" Yes, it's rare, for normal households. Not to mention, lots of animals have died here before due to unfixed cats having kittens that have died, and a few months back, the kitten was eaten in half in the garage by the other cats or kittens for whatever reason. I guess because it was dying. And I buried it. For all I know now the cats got prions from eating their own kind, and there are prions on the garage floor. There's also plenty of feces in the garage floor in some places. We don't have a proper composting situation so if any of our poultry dies, it's exposed to the dogs, so my mom started just throwing in the field. The same field the fucking cow eats grass from."

So I followed up with my PCP and we increased to 10 mg twice a day, and at my next follow up in February maybe, my GAD scores dropped so much and I felt so much better. Now, a month or two later, I feel exactly the same as I did before I started buspar. I have no idea what to do. Has this happened to anyone else? Do I try a different med? Do I increase my dose? I have taken lexapro before but I really don‚Äôt like how it made me feel more numb than normal. Like yes my anxiety was better but I was only feeling 50% of myself, if that makes sense. So I‚Äôd rather stay off SSRIs I think. But I also can‚Äôt keep feeling like this either. Other things to note- I do have PRN Xanax which works great but I use that sparingly.

We have only been on 4 dates but we text every day.

People there often write that when they met the \"the one\", they immediately felt connected and at ease with this person. The conversation flowed naturally and it felt like they have know this person for years etc etc. On the other hand, many people write that if you still feel anxious and on edge after a few dates, he probably isn't the one. Now I'm pretty sure that for someone with anxiety, particular social anxiety like me, the experience will be vastly different. I can't really tell whether the anxiety is a gut feeling that he isn't the one, or just your regular butterflies so many people tell you about. I can't decipher the signals my body is sending. So I thought I would ask here, what was it like when you first started dating your partner? Obviously I know everyone is different, so I'm not looking for an advice or guideline, I'm just interested in your experience."

I started exercising last week, and I had 1 really intense day, and this week I had 1 day of mild exercise and then 2 days in a row of one hour of very intensive workout. I decided to start exercising because my anxiety got a lot worse and impacts my life even more, I hoped exercise would remove the never ending feeling of stress tightness in my chest. Ngl I thought exercise would help get rid of anxiety quicker, but I still feel the same, bad. So I have to do intensive workout continuously for many weeks before I notice effects probably.

My last concussion was last November, so I haven‚Äôt played or done a ton of working out since then. I usually played at about 265 pounds which is on the lower end for football players at my position, but after being concussed I gained 20 pounds, partly due to the depression of not being able to play any more and also partly because I was still eating like I was a full time athlete. Now that it‚Äôs been a while, I wanted to start losing weight and getting back into shape. To do that, I did what I‚Äôve always done; run. I typically run 2.5-3 miles a day at about a 8.5-9 minute pace. Since I haven‚Äôt run in a while, I can‚Äôt really match that pace now. Prior to injury, my heart rate would get into the 170s and 180s while running and would get back to a resting rate of 55-65 an hour or two later. Now when I run my rate gets to the 180s and even 190s if I really push myself, and it takes so much longer to get back down to resting. This is where the anxiety comes in (diagnosed a few months ago officially but I‚Äôve had it forever). My heart rate stays at around 100-110 bpm for a few hours after running, and sometimes takes till the night time to get back down to the 60s for resting. This makes my anxiety pretty bad, and I was just looking for advice to A. Make sure that that can be normal for heart rate to do that, B. Advice for managing the anxiety due to it, and C. How to get back into shape despite it being difficult to because it takes me so long to recover."

I've now got a great relationship with my T, loads I want to explore, but feel restricted knowing that end date is looming. I just don't know how to make this ending feel any easier. I am going to discuss it again with him (we have briefly before and he has reassured me if I ever need to refer back into the service, I can) but it's just one of those things where I don't want that. I wish I could just continue with him until I was ready to go (Though I know the NHS doesn't do this). I feel like every single time I do therapy, more issues get brought up, and then I'm left trying to handle them alone, until it gets too much and I have to go through therapy, transference, and grief all over again. (Yes, I have had these feelings prior, but nowhere near this intense.) I know I should be able to do it alone, but having that one person that helps and encourages you each week, and gives you the tools to succeed in helping yourself, along with the reassurance you're using them correctly is great for me. How on earth can I get over this feeling of looming grief? Debating just going private because I truthfully think a therapist helps ground me a lot. Is this a negative way of thinking though? *TLDR: Therapy is ending, it stings because I like my therapist a lot, and not sure how to deal with it ending. Want long term therapy but unsure if it's a good idea.*"

Im not here to seek reassurance, i just wanna let this out, cuz i am feeling a Little down. So, i have intrusive thoughts and all, and you know‚Ä¶i hate it. Pretty sure everyone on this sub hates it. But there is something that is making me go nuts abt it. Idk why, but anytime i have like, an intrusive thought, it Will make me feel weird and all ( disconfort ). And then there would be this very disturbing feeling as if its like an urge. It not like i have the actual urge to do it i think ( i think im in denial ). Sometimes when i have these, it Will only happen when intrusive thoughts pop up. And it is becoming very terrifying. Idk if its normal, but after getting these disturbing thoughts in my head, there would be this weird feeling like an urge. And it scares me. Cuz its feels very real and idk what to do with it. I have been having intrusive thoughts ( mostly sexual ) and now it keeps telling me i have an urge to do it. The worst part is that i also have groinal responce when this this happens. And its making me crying and bawling my eyes out. ( idk if they are urges or not, i did Heard something called intrusive urges. But idk how to tell if its just my head, or if i really have urge ) I dont want this. I really wanna say that i dont feel the urge to do it. But with these weird feelings and intrusive thoughts. Its making me feel off. Idk if its the intrusives thoughts itself doing things ( cuz i have Heard that intrusive thoughts can sometimes make things feel real ). And i hate this feeling. This feeling is bothering and it hurts. Idk if im like sexually repressing something. Bc nothing happened, why would i suppress?! Why would this happen when i get these intrusive thoughts?! It makes me question everything, ‚Äò‚Äô are those real urges ‚Äò‚Äô or ‚Äò‚Äô am i denying my urges ‚Äò‚Äô This is scaring me, i feel like crying rn. Im scared of this, im scared that those arent intrusive thoughts, and l scared that those are real urges. Idk if im the only one who had this, but its making me feel like im hiding or repressing something. I dont like it. I feel so, alone‚Ä¶ idk what to do‚Ä¶ Its scaring me, idk if its an intrusive thought thing or if i am repressing something that i might not be admiting. This is scaring me.

It started on Monday after having coffee and smoking a hash joint‚ÄîI suddenly felt lightheaded, dizzy, short of breath, tingly in my hands and face, weak, and had cold hands. I also had watery diarrhea and frequent urination. My BP was low, and I legit thought I was dying. My friends took me to the ER, but after sitting there for 4 hours constantly feeling unwell, they told me my vitals (BP, oxygen, etc.) were normal and sent me home. Over the next few days, I kept having weird muscle pain, neck joint discomfort, food pipe pain, and digestive issues. Then, out of nowhere, I woke up at 5 AM (despite sleeping late) with my heart racing and feeling dizzy again. I went to a walk-in clinic (no health insurance), and after checking my vitals and doing neurological tests, the doctor said everything was fine but recommended a blood test. Now, I keep getting random waves of dizziness, weakness, and anxiety-like symptoms out of nowhere, and it‚Äôs really messing with my head. My girlfriend and friends have been supportive, but i feel like I‚Äôm bothering them too much and-being far from home makes it worse. Could this all be anxiety? Has anyone else dealt with something similar? I feel trapped in my own body, and it‚Äôs exhausting. i have had panic attacks in the past but like 4 years ago and i used to constantly worry or fear certain things and give it a lot of thought, whereas this time around i don‚Äôt think i was consciously in a vicious worry or fear overthinking cycle.

My head also feels really hot sometimes, even when it isn't, and there always seems to be pressure in my head and face. My eye has also been twitching for about a week now. When I went over these things with my doctor, she starting googling my symptoms in front of me... and then flat out told me she didn't know... and then reccomended an MRI of my head with and without contrast. 1)... not feeling like it's super needed, especially since she herself said that this doesn't sound like anything like a brain tumor.. 2) i'm so ungodly claustrophobic 3) i don't want anything with contrast, the whole idea of dye being injected to my veins is not exactly desirable I feel like she wasn't really confident and I don't want to put myself through it if I don't have to.

I've been at uni for the last year and smoked occasionally with my flatmates nothing heavy had 1g each a couple of times but never felt dependant on it at all. Then my friends brought a 1000mg THC vape before this i had taken some of my friends perscribed ritalin because he claimed it would make me 'lock in' then about 5hrs later had his vape about 5 takes but as im not an experience smoker they were bad inhales and somewhat painful i was thinking about this pain and my friends somewhat taking the piss when suddenly Im hit with intense fear and paranoia i thought i was having a heart attack because of the pounding heart and full body painful tingles which didnt help and was very distrustful of my friends, this was a painful 4hrs of trying to stay calm but eventually the feeling calmed down and i was fine for the next two weeks until with a different group of friends I tried edibles had 3.5mg split between 10 cookies (i had 3 cookies) i was feeling a bit anxious because of my last experience but once again the high made me super anxious this time i felt it more in my heart and i think looking at my pale reflection bc of fear also made things worse. I had some minor dissosciative hallucinations also but i feel now this was because of anxiety cause by the drug than the drug itself. T the next day i felt a bit anxious after waking up but then felt fine until 2 days later when i had a fair amount of vodka on valentines day w my gf. This brought up heart palpatations and fear of heart attack but this time didnt go away i let it rest for a few days while i was home fro reading week but while varying in intensity didnt really go and scared me eventually i went to the hospital after a feeling of not being able to go to sleep and they ran tests on my heart which turned out to be completely fine. After learning this my fear went from physical help to fear of mental health particularly developing psychosis or schizophrenia and i had difficulty sleeping at all. Ive always somewhat seen scary faces in the dark if i try too but the anxiety made it more scary and vivid it also sometimes felt like my bed was flying. And sometimes felt a bit disosciated form my body. Soon after this however I returned to uni and managed to get some sleep w my gf. It has been over a month now since the worst of my anxiety which was about for a week after i had the edibles but i still dont feel quite right i occasionally have sleepless nights or at least I dont feel like ive properly slept at all (sometimes i do get sleep but feel like I havent) what persists is a physical feeling of slight unease in body and heart and often feeling heavy in mt head. Im not sure where to go from here ive never had long lasting or persistent anxieties in my life before and dont feel like my current anxiety majorly impacts my life but does annoy me and make me uncomfortable especially when alone. Im not currently seeing a therapist because my symptoms dont feel so damaging but i am afraid of things getting worse even though im convinced at this point anxiety is my only issue (but its still unpleasent). Ive decided never to do any drugs again (weed really isn't a safe and fun as ppl think) in my life but alcohol isnt as avoidable even though a hangover now feels alot worse. I also ironically think reading up about things like this online makes the anxiety worse as it makes me fear my symptoms worsening). Ultimately im just fed up of this anxiety and wondering if anyone who has experienced something similar has any tips or a story of full recovery ( that would make me feel better). I feel like i want to be like my old self even though the idea of imagining my old self probably doesnt help. Thanks"

I‚Äôm planning on speaking with the Dr not sure if I should increase up to 100mg or remain at 50mg for a bit longer."

Within an hour of taking the first dose of 875 I was crying and feeling like I was having a melt down. Then all night I was waking up in full blown panic attacks, sweating, my heart beating out of my chest, and shaking. I do not have panic attacks like this!! I've had so many panic attacks through the night (3-4) that my body is still trembling like my nervous system has gone into overdrive. IDK what to do!"

    "text": "Why does anxiety or fear return if we don‚Äôt face it regularly? When I manage to overcome anxiety or fear but don‚Äôt repeatedly confront it, it feels like I lose the habit of being calm and become afraid/panic again. For example, if I fly on a plane every day, I‚Äôm not afraid. If I fly once a month, I start feeling more anxious. And if I fly only once a year, I‚Äôm almost guaranteed to have a panic attack. This makes me wonder: Is exposure therapy or effort to overcome fear ultimately pointless, since the fear seems to return to the starting point if I don‚Äôt keep practicing? What am I doing wrong? There must be something I‚Äôm missing. Other people who don‚Äôt struggle with anxiety seem to handle these situations effortlessly. Why is that?"

    "text": "(M23) Help, I don't know what is wrong with me. So, it all started around july 2022, I was going to the gym at the time and I was focusing on gaining muscle, and I was doing a pretty good job when it came to fitness and nutrition, until one day I was working out and out of nowhere I felt the urge to throw up and boom a panic attack hit me. I had to go home since I was so worried that I was gonna throw up, I felt immediately better when I got home and when to the gym the next day. but over the coming weeks, I started to feel that I'm losing appetite more and more, I would feel my knees getting weaker, shortness of breath, chest tightness, loss of strength and energy, all these were happening at the same time but I didn't care and went on with my life. 3 months later college started again, and immediately on the first day I had a panic attack, a week went by and my anxiety went up so high that nothing entered my stomach for almost 2 days except a couple of glasses of water. I went to a gastroenterologist because I thought it's a stomach issue that i'm having and he did some tests only to find out that everything is in great condition, it was him that told me that I might have anxiety and should think less of my stomach and everything will be better on it's own. for the rest of the semester, i did keep getting better until one day I received a call and a really sad news made it all worse, eventually leading to me getting back to smoking cigarettes. so, it has been more than 2 years and I still have this problem, I don't know if this is long term anxiety? depression? eating disorder? or just some physical problem with my stomach that the doctor couldn't catch. I have lost interest in almost everything, back in the day I wanted to go out everyday, now I go out like 2 times a month and I don't even enjoy these 2 times. when someone asks for going out to eat I would just tell them that I already ate even if I hadn't ate anything for that day. I also lost interest in going to the gym since I don't have the energy to lift weights. before all this started, I was completely healthy, and nothing major happened in my life except that I went to jail in June 2022 but got out after 2 days when they found out I'm innocent. but now it feels like everything in my life was a mistake, I'm always thinking about things that happened like 8 years ago and worry that it might come up again, not to mention that my past mistakes always haunt me. I do want to mention that thankfully this condition did not affect my sleeping, but almost everything else in my life is affected. I would like to hear from you guys and if anyone else had an experience like this before and how did you manage to overcome it?"

Hi everyone, I‚Äôm writing here to receive advice as I‚Äôm really struggling with social anxiety and blushing. I‚Äôm a 26 yo guy who, despite being an absolutely normal and attractive considered guy, never had a long term relationship with a girl; fell in love several times but it never went right. My lack of ‚Äústories to tell‚Äù about any long term ex girlfriend and the fact that I‚Äôm single despite being appreciated is giving me big insecurities. What bothers me the most is the fact that whenever I‚Äôm asked about previous partners or ESPECIALLY when teased about my sexuality I always blush, and just because of my intrigued mind I always feel people assume or might think I‚Äôm gay or I‚Äôm a virgin. Although being open minded and have absolutely nothing against homosexuals and absolutely nothing against virgins (I was a virgin till 2-3 years ago and nothing changed in my perspective, I‚Äôd never choose a partner based on body count or similar useless stuff) I‚Äôm always embarrassed and blush. Examples: - met a gay professor of mine at the cinema, I was with a friend. When he recalled the episode at work ‚Äî> blushed - chatting with a girl at work, saying ‚ÄúMat is my favorite coworker ‚Äî> blushed - group of friends asked if I have any relationship news ‚Äî> blushed - grandma asked if is there any girl that i like at work ‚Äî> blushed What can I do to stop blushing?

I havent heard good things about Spirit Airlines which is what we are flying. I cant seem to pinpoint what my exact fear is.

He thinks I am going to get us kicked off of the plane. I hate my anxiety because while part of my brain is screaming DANGER, the other side is working just fine telling me it is ok. Last time I had a full blown panic attack was last summer. I was uncontrollably sobbing while stopped in traffic on a very high bridge. The feeling overwhelmed me and I tried to stop it. I am scared that will happen on our flight. My doctor told me to take a double dose of my anxiety medication (buspar) which I plan to do. But Please help me think of ways to keep myself from having a full blown panic attack. I don't want to cause any trouble. Can I ask the flight attendants to check in on me, or should I not tell them of my fear? I'm honestly hoping I'll just be so afraid that I pass out and won't have to worry about it üòÇ"

    "text": "Adrenaline jolts - panic attacks? **Trigger Warning: Bad health / health anxiety / chronic illness / panic attacks** A bit of background: I'm chronically ill and have a lot of trauma related to how I got ill - I had an adverse reaction to an antibiotic (Ciprofloxacin), and amongst many scary symptoms over the first few months, I had trouble swallowing and panic attacks (never had panic attacks previously). 2 years on I'm still housebound with the resulting CFS/POTS from it, and since medications etc can cause relapses of the antibiotic symptoms, I have a lot of anxiety related to taking anything new or any new symptoms. For a while every time I had an ache or pain it'd trigger a panic attack, and I've worked hard to calm that down. But I still occasionally cause myself a jolt of adrenaline when I'm unsure about a supplement I've taken, etc. For a split second I'll think I'm having trouble swallowing or can't breathe properly, and it'll trigger a big jolt of adrenaline, then I'll start to feel kinda spaced out. I calm myself down with logic - you're fine, you can breathe, etc, but it's such a horrible feeling and leaves me feeling strange. I want to get a handle on this, but am trying to work out exactly what you'd call it - is it a mini panic attack? Is it a sort of PTSD? Anyone had similar and worked through it??

Biggest issue was sudden onset of lightheadedness where I couldn't even turn my head without feeling like I was going to faint. Two trips to the ER and all my cardiac and neuro tests came back normal. Fast forward to last summer when I was put on blood pressure meds because of high BP readings at the doctors office. Ever since I started the meds I get much more frequent \"attacks\" and they seem to come out of nowhere. Symptoms are lightheadedness, feeling like I have a mask on with numbness around my eyes, heart palpitations and shaking hands. The numbness, heart palpitations and shaking hands go away after a bit but the lightheadedness can linger on and off for a couple of days. My doctor also prescribed 10 mg propranolol as needed. I also notice it's very heightened when I'm in a crowded situation. Can anxiety come on out of nowhere with no obvious triggers?? I'm just so tired of feeling like this. I'm switching BP meds one more time to see if that helps. Thank you for any insight!"

Je souffre d'anxi√©t√© li√© a la crise cardiaque, cardiophobie je dirais. Pour vous expliqu√© rapidement mon parcours, j'ai perdu mon Papa en octobre 2023, il est d√©c√©d√© d'un infarctus il avait 54 ans. J'√©tais vraiment tr√®s proche de lui, c'√©tait mon p√®re mais aussi mon meilleur pote etc... bref, l'homme de ma vie. En novembre 2023, mon fils est n√©e. il n'a pas connu son grand p√®re et inversement. Des mois sont pass√©s, j'√©tais triste mais pas anxieux jusqu'au moment fatidique du 21 mai 2024 ou j'ai eu une attaque de panique, j'ai ressenti tout comme un infarctus, palpitations douleur poitrine etc lorsque j'√©tais au travail, mais c'√©tait une crise de panique qui est survenu de nul part, depuis... \"L'ENFER\" Je pense chaque jour que je vais y passer comme lui. J'ai pourtant 31 ans, je ne fume pas, je ne bois pas ( ou tr√®s occasionnellement pour les soir√©es ) j'ai √©t√© plusieurs fois aux urgences, j'ai vu un cardiologue et tout est OK, mais malgr√© √ßa, cela me rassure pas. J'ai arr√™ter le caf√©, et j'ai peur de faire du sport vu que cela fait travailler le coeur. J'ai aussi vu une Psychologue/Th√©rapeute cela me fait du bien sur le coup, mais ensuite cette peur revient. Je suis anxieux mais par rapport a certains, je m'estime heureux, je continue de sortir faire des courses, je continue d'aller au travail etc.. Bref, je vie ma vie quoi mais dans un coin de ma t√™te toujours cette peur d'y passer n'importe quand. Bien √©videment j'ai des sympt√¥mes H24 a la poitrine histoire de... Il y a des ant√©c√©dents familiaux important dans la famille au niveau cardiaque qui semble touch√© les hommes, mon papa en est d√©c√©d√© et mes deux oncles on fait aussi un infarctus mais ne sont pas d√©c√©d√©s. Y'a t-il une chance que je passe a travers? Voila en gros ma \"petite histoire\". J'ai envie d'√™tre fort pour mon fils et d'arr√™ter de penser a cela mais je n'y arrive pas. Je cherche des personnes qui aurait peut √™tre v√©cu cela et qui pourrait m'aider. En vous remerciant. FaiRy"

My high was very intense because I believe I smoked too much for my first time and I had the worst paranoia ever. I think I had my first panic attack while smoking weed. A year later I had a panic attack in church. I had to leave church because I was hyperventilating. I was about to faint it felt. fast-forward to 2016 I have a panic attack in organic chemistry class. Then another one in 2021 after doing a cbd thc tincture. I had to get on antidepressants because of the pure panic. I got off of the ssris a year later because I felt better. Anxiety came back but more mildly. I would have panic attacks but not very severe. Fast forward to tonight and I drank a 10 mg cbd/5 mg thc soda. It triggered the longest panic attack I‚Äôve had. It lasted like an hour and a half. My hr has lowered but it‚Äôs still in the low 100s.but I‚Äôm feeling sleepy already. I‚Äôm afraid to sleep. I will never do any of that frap ever again. When will I feel back to normal :( someone talk to me :("

    "text": "Could my psychiatrist drop me if I stop taking meds (Zoloft) So initially I just went in for propranolol. Really bad shaking, sweating, and fast heartbeat during presentations. Heard about propranolol and I had to jump through a bunch of hoops to get this medication. Went to doctor, doctor didn‚Äôt want to prescribe it and sent me to the er, er sent me to a therapist, therapist sent me to the psychiatrist. After months, I finally got it (still haven‚Äôt used it) and I was surprised when I found out I‚Äôd also been prescribed Zoloft. He didn‚Äôt really tell me why, he just told me the side effects and all that. Honestly, I took it for 5 days and stopped. I felt like I couldn‚Äôt breathe properly, started coughing like crazy, and was barely eating. He said he wanted to see me every month and I changed my appointment because I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôll get dropped when I tell him I haven‚Äôt been taking Zoloft. I guess I just thought I didn‚Äôt need it? That and it being a drug just freaked me out. I‚Äôm 18 for context and I have no history of depression, just some anxiety that peaks when I have a presentation, on a daily basis it‚Äôs obviously still there but manageable. So what exactly could Zoloft do for me? I hate the idea of taking drugs, even if it‚Äôs just prescription medicine. I do get anxious when interacting with new people, in new situations and sometimes I shake a little, could Zoloft really get rid of all of this? or should I just continue trying exposure therapy? I felt that exposure therapy has helped me improve a little bit, but I‚Äôm still on the fence about giving Zoloft a shot since I know it takes quite a while for it to actually start working. I guess I‚Äôm also a bit embarrassed about taking Zoloft. If my dad‚Äôs side of the family ever found out, I‚Äôd never hear the end of it. Also, I‚Äôm sosososo sorry for the rant, I just don‚Äôt really have anybody to ask this to, thank you!"

So fair warning. \\* \\* \\* If you have, I am talking about Buck. But was always my favorite character. I love a himbo lol but when they also had him come out as bi, I felt even more of a love for him. I'm an openly gay man and I always felt connected to Buck, but now...I feel more connected to him? We are very different in professions, firefighter and theatre teacher, and physical appearance, but personality wise...we are both golden retrievers and some things he does and says just feel like what I would do or say. But, when they started to give him a love interest (Tommy) that wasn't who everyone thought it would be (Eddie)...I had a weird panic attack. That was a year ago and I honestly didn't think anything of it. I chalked it up to a coincidence and I wasn't sure what had caused it the day. In the show, they broke up and it seems like they are going to have him fall for who most people, myself included, wants him to be with, Eddie. But this past episode, he hooked up with Tommy and I felt uncomfortable? Not panic, but it did open my eyes to being like \"Why am I upset he's hooking up with Tommy?\" I feel like...protective of him? Maybe it's that I see myself in him and I want him to be with Eddie so it hurts not getting that for him? I am also having this realization while I type so it's partially a stream of consciousness. Maybe it's more of a protective thing too? I don't know, I just get anxious and overwhelmed sometimes about his character and it's really hard to put it into words. I am planning to talk to my therapist about it, but I wanted to just see if anyone has experienced this or something like this?"

    "text": "Head tingling sensation, gastric issues I‚Äôve been dealing with anxiety and hypochondria for few years now. There are periods when i am feeling better and then there are periods where it gets really, really bad and really hard to deal with. To make long story short, i‚Äôve been mostly fine until few months ago when mostly thanks to my gastric issue my anxiety returned. I‚Äôve been having heart palpitations and what feels like fluttering in my diaphragm and left side, sensations that feel like a heartbeat skips and staying out of breath for a second. Went to few doctors and they said that it‚Äôs because of my eating, weight and gastric issues. I would have almost constant acid, sour feeling in the mouth, burping, pain in the stomach, left side and even upper back‚Ä¶ But like i said it started getting worse. One thing that i can‚Äôt figure out is this sudden tingling sensation i get, usually on the left side of my head/scalp. I am not sure should i, but i am connecting this to my stomach/left side issues and i feel like it somehow comes from there (large intestine?) and is giving me this sudden sensation usually on the same, left side of my head. It doesn‚Äôt seem to be a single spot, sometimes it will be more on the front left part, sometimes in the back and it lasts for few seconds. I feel like i usually get it if i have a coffee and when i am being anxious and having this weird feeling in my head and eyes area. I know that this might sound maybe strange to some of you, but i just wanted to ask was anyone ever dealing with something similar and what can i do to figure out what is the cause of this exactly. Like i said, i am also very anxious and dealing with other issues too, like sinuses, heart palpitations, panic attacks that i am trying to deal with but my main problem have been gastric and stomach issues that have been going for too long and that i guess are also getting much worse thanks to my anxiety and stress. Thanks!"

    "text": "The Fear Ladder As a fellow introvert who (like most of us) struggles with anxieties and somewhat fear, I always look into ways do learn how to live with this and embrace it, instead of falling a victim to it. One of my hobbies is indulging in non fiction books, be it a history or even self-help books/motivational. Recently I fell into a pair of good anxiety books and would like to share an exercise that the book ‚Äúit is ok to feel fear‚Äùprovided (probably is a well known exercise anyways) The Fear Ladder The fear ladder is a structured way to gradually face your fears in manageable steps. How to do it: 1. Write down a fear you want to overcome. 2. Break it into smaller steps, ranking them from least to most intimidating. 3. Start with the least intimidating step and work your way up. 4. Celebrate small victories along the way. For instance, if you're afraid of networking, your ladder might look like this: Step 1: Make eye contact and smile at a stranger. Step 2: Say \"hello\" to someone new. Step 3: Start a short conversation with a colleague. Step 4: Attend a small networking event and introduce yourself to one person. Step 5: Speak to multiple people at a large networking event."

I feel shorted breathed when I walk up hills or at work and I classify myself as a fit guy (Play sports, Go gym, work a hands on job, etc). I‚Äôve been thinking this could be some sort of brain tumour due to the sudden feeling of anxiety and the pressure in my head and my jaw all the time out of nowhere. I also have been less hungry. But then I‚Äôm scared if it is a brain tumour that I‚Äôll die young. Last night i had been worrying a lot about the pressure and I was googling about brain tumours in the shower then out of nowhere I felt so nauseous and felt as if my ears blocked up it honestly felt as if i was going to faint. When i went vomit i just gagged and nothing came out. I‚Äôm going to talk to a doctor about this and see if i can get MRI scans but i just feel like if I do that and nothing bad comes up I‚Äôve just wasted my time and my parents were right about it being ‚Äújust nothing‚Äù I don‚Äôt get why I feel like this all of a sudden I miss when i would live without a worry in my life. I‚Äôve got the job of my dreams and A good life. But I just feel like something is wrong with me. Could these just be anxiety scaring my body into it ?"

I know this sounds a lot like a already familiar symptom of anxiety where you have a sort of shock and/or a feeling of falling among other symptoms. Although I've had those a few times I've been getting this odd issue where I'm about to sleep then my mind kinda goes weird, not like a usual panic I'd usually get but I have weird visuals like a bad fever dream almost not comprehensible. I often wake up a little spooked, at first I thought it happened the second I fell asleep but there's been 10-20 minute gaps between falling asleep than waking up but feel like seconds. I've had a similar issue a few years back but the visuals were more of a result of lack of sleep which as of right now I sleep fine enough until now. There's other symptoms like my mouth over salivating and nausea which are a scary combination if you know you know but fortunately it's just bad pairing of symptoms and saves me a trip to the bathroom. I also feel funny but it's kinda hard to describe, I assume it's the feeling you get when you wake up really fast and your body hasn't caught up, kinda floaty feeling."

I have only been to therapy a little bit, but had to stop due to my therapist being out of network. In the past, it‚Äôs mainly been the racing heart rate, repeating thoughts, and my thumb would go numb (weird right?) I almost always feel faint or out of breath anytime something happens. I‚Äôm always shaking. As I‚Äôve gotten older, it‚Äôs been manifesting physically a lot harder. I have got tunnel vision before (that has not happened in a while) and my more common one in recent time is nightmares. I hate that it comes out of nowhere. I never know when it will happen and it impacts how well I sleep. A few times I have had an entire anxiety attack and I spiral. I can‚Äôt breathe. My mind doesn‚Äôt feel like my own. It‚Äôs like I can‚Äôt even reason with myself. I have been alone each time it‚Äôs happened. Sometimes (during times something bad happens), I will even have a nightmare and then wake up in the middle of the night with an anxiety attack. This also tends to increase when something bad happens in my life. Yesterday, my boyfriend broke up with me ‚Äòout of the blue‚Äô (I had some issues with him myself and I was even thinking of leaving him, so it was a shock but not a surprise we didn‚Äôt make it). This is why I‚Äôm trying to seek more help. In the past, I have got very depressed and had so much anxiety about myself when it came to the guys I had feelings for. I don‚Äôt think I will let it get to a bad point, I just want to manage my pain in a healthy way. Does anyone have any advice that can help? I am going to be seeking a therapist here soon because I am interested in medication. But, I want to also learn some coping mechanisms so I don‚Äôt have to fully rely on medication."

    "text": "Got my first job [22nb] & really nervous Got my first job & super nervous Hello, I'm 22 & recently got my first job. It's to be a cook at a food stand, it starts the 26th. For the past about five years [since covid began basically] I've been a shut in, like I've left my house maybe 15 times in total since & everytime a parent/grandparent or sibling was w/ me. So needless to say I'm very anxious to be On My Own. The main sources of my anxiety are: 1: Fitness level. I'm trying to go on walks & exercise more before starting, but I'm horribly unfit [like winded going up a small set of stairs or checking the mail unfit] & while once I'm there I'll be in one spot, the bus stop-->where I'll be working is [for me] a super long walk so I'm really anxious about not being able to walk that [again I am exercising now to try & lessen it, but since I'm so horribly unfit I'm worried what I'm capable of doing now won't heavily effect that] 2: Bus. I've been on the bus before so ik how the process works but I'm very anxious & paranoid. I'm anxious that I'll miss my stop[s? I haven't checked the routes yet so idk if I'll need only one bus or several] but the MAIN part I'm worried about & ik this is extreme, is I'm worried about getting killed or kidnapped or something off the bus, especially since some of my shifts will be late getting off [& some of my shifts someone could probably meet me at the bus stop on the way home/walk me to it before work, but most of them, like my first day, that won't be an option because it'll clash w/ their work]. Plus as paranoid as I am I'm weirdly not a very Aware person, so I feel like unfortunately I maybe wouldn't notice if I was being followed [or my brain would go \"I'm being paranoid this is probably a normal everyday person who happens to go the same way\" which in 99% of cases would be fine cause that'd be the case but I'm worried I'll do that when it's not the case] 3: That I won't be able to handle it. It's my first job & during the talks & stuff they asked if I've ever worked & they were nice & said \"Don't worry thats fine, we'll train you [place I work] is a good place for a first job\" & ik someone who works there & she likes it there, but still. I'm worried that first week or two I'll be fired [or so stressed I'll quit, which I don't wanna do I need a job & the pay is good, but I'm still worried]. Sorry if this makes no sense. Basically I'm asking for advice on how to alleviate these anxieties, if any of y'all have any tips on certain aspects [like advice for going out alone for the first time, first time bus rider tips to make the experience less daunting, etc] ? Oh & this isn't an anxiety thing, but for folks who get really car sick, is bus rides the same [like just as car sick on a bus as in a car] or is it better [bus rides less sick than cars] or worse ? I get super car sick so I wanna know if I'd probably be good to just go as is or if I should try & look into car sick treatment"

I've had anxiety issues my whole life that has basically destroyed my life. i would get all kinds of weird heart symptoms that contributed to it.. My skipped beats were bad for awhile but for a long time they been great and I rarely got any other than something very occasional. Suddenly last night I ate this greasy chinese food and started getting them, Shrugged it off and they kept coming and coming.. every 10 mins every five mines again 40 mins later. All random intervals and they feel terrible. Pop, flips twisting, stuttering.. i hate the feeling. This continued all night into today and i decided to go to the ER. they gave me an EKG, chest xray, blood work, urine, and i was on a monitor that wasn't being recorded unfortunately because i probably had dozens. The heart doctor said they told him about the EKG and if all the other tests are normal to send me home and I will follow up with him. I am pretty sure he said he saw a couple of PVC's on the EKG. I know these are the bad types so I am worried that all these feelings I been getting are all PVC's. It was hell trying to sleep or finding a position where they would stop, but it seemed like no matter what I did i would still get them. . I am still get into it now .. they come and go well over 24 hours.. Anyone get anything like this or have any advice?"

A few weeks ago, I was to have surgery and was given Triazolam with laughing gas to sedate me enough for IV sedation, and it caused a severe negative reaction. I experienced hallucinations of a paradoxical reality within the duality, and other visuals I have a hard time describing other than I was actively tripping as if I had taken some sort of psychedelic drug. It was awful. I did not have the surgery because I was hostile, and unwilling to cooperate (don't remember that), and now have the new surgery coming up. I am completely traumatized. That event was so deeply triggering that I don't know how to cope with the reality that it may happen again. Now, I have rationalized it (to the best of my capabilities). The medical staff provided a benzodiazepine (something I cannot have), and the mixture of gas definitely didn't help. I'm in the process of seeking out testing to see what medications are viable for pre-med sedation, and I hope the results ease some of this weight, but I had found out all pre-op IV-sedatives are benzo's.... I have asked if there's a way to swap out the IV medication, but that's just protocol and that doesn't really sit right with me.... worsening the anxiety that I have. How do I deal/manage with this weight on my shoulders? What has been your experience(s) or methods of dealing with this?"

    "text": "Started having anxiety attacks after taking medication Hello everybody, First time i post on reddit. English is not my lative language so i will do my best to be as comprehensive as possible. A few months ago, I was diagnosed with ADHD and therefore received treatment, Ritalin for those who know what that is. But I quickly stopped because I noticed it was causing me anxiety attacks, particularly a racing heart, difficulty breathing, the feeling that I was going to die any minute. For 2 months after stopping the treatement everything was fine, but on the day of my departure for my vacation, I started having the same anxiety or panic attack for no reason at the boarding gate, probably because I was frustrated that the boarding was delayed. I attributed it to the impressive amount of caffeine I was consuming throughout the day, as a large dose of caffeine ironically does me good. So I have reduced my caffeine intake, going from maybe 7 or 8 coffees (double espresso) to just 1 coffee in the morning when I wake up. Everything was getting better and last night all of a sudden I felt a wave of anxiety wash over me, with a feeling of imminent death, it was extremely unpleasant, the only common factor I found is my coffee consumption, the act of dipping my lips in caffeine triggers waves of anxiety that can last all day, this morning for example I didn't consume caffeine and I feel very good and serene. I am aware that this site is not a medical office, and I have actually made an appointment with a doctor for a checkup upon my return from vacation, but are there any people who have had the same experiences as me? I have the impression that my problem is entirely psychological, especially because before taking Ritalin, I had to undergo an ECG and a blood test, and my heart is in very good condition. Moreover, when I exercise, my heart doesn't give me any problems; on the contrary, I feel a sense of well-being, and if there were an issue with my heart, I doubt I would be able to regain my composure and calm down. If anyone has had an experience similar to mine, particularly sudden intolerance to caffeine, your testimony is welcome. Thanks anyway for reading this wall of text."

    "text": "I misspelled a new coworker‚Äôs name and I feel really guilty about it So today this guy I work with was training a new guy who I‚Äôve never met before. The guy I work with came over by himself to ask me to make two drinks for them and I went to write their names on their cups because that‚Äôs what we do. I wrote the first guy‚Äôs name but I didn‚Äôt know who he was training so I asked who it was. The new guy‚Äôs name is Emmanuel and I didn‚Äôt know how to spell it so I just kind of stood there confused and asked how to spell it. Both the trainer guy and also one of my other coworkers tried spelling it out for me and I think I got confused and already started writing with Sharpie on the cup and wrote Emaneul because I thought that was how to spell it. My other coworker was like ‚Äúclose enough‚Äù and the guy (who is the one training the new guy) just grabbed the cups and walked away. And I was freaking out because I felt bad I didn‚Äôt know how to spell his name. When I got home later I checked the work app and realized that I spelled his name completely wrong and I feel so stupid and horrible. I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about how for the next 7 hours this guy has to have his name misspelled on his cup for the rest of his shift. I didn‚Äôt mean for it to happen I genuinely didn‚Äôt know how to spell his name and I feel really bad. I feel like an asshole for this like I don‚Äôt know what to do now!!!!"

Hi all, after flooding in my area led to my house being infested by ants (unfortunately I did not imagine this though I wish I did) I now am stuck in a very awful loop of being fixated on bugs being in my house. I don‚Äôt know what is happening and this is not a symptom I‚Äôve had before, but now any time I am stressed (and sometimes even if I‚Äôm not), I develop these bug bite looking red bumps which are intensely itchy, which I assume is related to the stress I felt when the ants were in my house. Unfortunately I have been scratching them quite a bit and now I‚Äôve got two legs that look like I stood in a swamp full of mosquitos. Cortisone doesn‚Äôt help and neither does eczema cream. Has anyone else had this happen? I am mortified at the damage I‚Äôve done to my legs and every time one spot is making progress, another one pops up and I get stressed out and itchy all over again. I am miserable and I do not want to keep taking Benadryl as I know it‚Äôs not a long term solution. Dx GAD/OCD & on Zoloft"

    "text": "Had to Cancel Seeing Husband Overseas Long story short, my husband has been overseas for about 6 months. I had plans to go see him this morning. Well, my anxiety got in the way, MAJORLY. Last night I could not sleep, which eventually kept me up for about 24-27ish hours. I dozed off a couple times, likely sleeping a total of about 2 hours. (This may sound silly, but last summer we went to Europe for the first time and I think I got traumatized by my first major time change, I‚Äôm a bit of a hypochondriac, so not getting enough sleep has started to scare me.) My mom picks me up, takes me to the airport, but I can‚Äôt get out. She tries to encourage me, my husband calls for encouragement (blessed, he doesn‚Äôt get upset with me or mad), I try to encourage myself. But the idea that I had already been up for 24 hours + had a 15 hour flight alone..my thoughts were racing. All night I had been having other physical symptoms of anxiety/panic and they hadn‚Äôt really stopped. I ended up not boarding my flight. I‚Äôm SO disappointed. Not in the fact that I didn‚Äôt go, but in the fact that I think the way I think and that it gets in the way of so many things. I do not think I would‚Äôve had a good flight or day once I landed because of the anxiety and sleep and time change added on with such the long flight. I just am not sure I‚Äôm in the right headspace for that right now. There is a possibility of me flying in next week with my in laws, but even so, I‚Äôm not sure I feel comfortable. I‚Äôm doing an extra therapy session this coming week to get my therapist‚Äôs opinion. I also had children‚Äôs melatonin that I think I should try out sometime this week, but also have a fear of trying new meds.üòÖ I don‚Äôt wish anxiety or panic on ANYONE. I beg to have happier, more pleasant thoughts. Please send me prayers, good thoughts, good vibes. This is tough. Thank you in advance."

    "text": "Medication Troubleshooting I was prescribed Xanax/Alprazolam over a year ago PRN (as needed) for insomnia related to anxiety. Now, thankfully through therapy my therapist and I have developed non-pharmacological ways to help me go to sleep on rough nights, but the Xanax is a great emergency button on the few nights where nothing else works. I end up taking 2mg maybe 2-4 times a month. It works great for what it's supposed to do, it makes me sleepy and calms my mind and body and I get a great night of sleep after. What I immediately noticed though is that alongside those wonderful effects, my body also gets really heavy and uncoordinated and I start stumbling around like I'm drunk which normally is fine because I'm only ever taking it right before bed but my biggest continued issue is that the next day and for the following 24 hours the mental sedative effects have totally cleared but my body is still super uncoordinated and heavy feeling. It's gotten to the point where I am really hesitant to take the medication even when I need it because that heavy uncoordinated feeling is really disruptive to my day the next day and it doesn't look or feel great when I'm trying to go around town and get things done while looking like I've been getting blasted on morning mimosas. My questions are as follows: 1. Has anyone else dealt with this before? 2. Is my dose just too high? I'm a bigger girl and the 0.25 and the 0.5mg doses did absolutely nothing for my acute anxiety so my psych suggested to go for something more heavy duty 3. Is there a way to mitigate that heavy body feeling? My disclaimer at the end is that I would like to clarify that I am legally prescribed this medication and am under active treatment by a psychiatrist so please don't PM me about how/where to get the medication. I am also fully aware of all the negative sides of benzo usage and I am not really looking to be lectured about that at this time, thank you!!"

I have both anxiety and depression and involved in weekly therapy sessions and on medication for the anxiety, depression and insomnia issues currently. Prescribed Zoloft and Trazadone. I have had a history of anxiety and depression for years now however, I am currently being treated for very deep personal trauma related issues. I do however believe however that this phobia was present years ago but, I never really acknowledged it as a true phobia or problem but, it seems to be much worse now especially with the increased anxiety type issues. I struggle to sleep at night, my mind races constantly and endlessly for hours it seems. Negative Provoking thoughts mostly or fixations on the negatives that have happened within my past. While I am in bed, this fear or phobia you might say creeps up on me. It's terrible! I think that I may be bleeding from somewhere on or in my body. I will get up and check my mouth or on my skin in the bathroom mirror obsessively multiple times over the course of a couple hours sometimes. It's always this fear of blood. I don't understand it at all honestly. I don't have an actual fear of blood itself it's just this specific issue. Can anyone relate to this or know what may be the direct link of this phobia? It's kind of like an OCD issue especially considering I check multiple times for the reassurance. I am going to address this with my therapist next week as well. I just wanted to reach out and see if anyone else here has had a similar experience."

    "text": "Fear of memory loss/rumination about memory Hi there, I've noticed an uptick in my anxiety since the new year and in the last month, I've been living in a constant-state of rumination about memory loss. This ultimately was triggered by me trying to recall when I got off my Prozac last year and when I couldn't remember the specifics, I had a full blown panic attack (roughly 3 weeks ago). I was on 30 MG Prozac for 3 years to treat a similar rumination pattern that was diagnosed as GAD and DPDR. I got off the medication last April because I felt that my symptoms had improved and the medication was unnecessary. I can't recall if my memory was poor at that time, but I was so fixated on my consciousness that I don't think I cared much to be insightful about my memory. Since then, I've been hyper analyzing my memory. I'm a server and since I've returned to work from my vacation, I will look at regulars and wonder the last time I spoke to them and what we discussed (essentially intrusive thoughts) and I will feel physical anxiety if I can't recall. I don't rememember telling people things during this time, and recently recalling longterm memories has been a challenge as well. When I'm not actively thinking about memory, I feel really \"brain foggy.\" I'm curious to know if anyone else struggles with OCD-type rumination about memory and if anxiety also impacts their longterm memory as well? I understand anxiety can impact short term and working memory, but I'm starting to fear my memory will start to progressively get worse and worse. I have a doctors appt. Next month and a couple therapist appts. Established to help me work through this. But PLEASE anyone who struggles with memory and have gotten through it or have any advice please let me know. I'm really worried I have some undiagnosed brain damage or disease."

Like I could be driving my car, and it‚Äôs small things like seeing something dead on the side of the street, and my mind spirals, I am constantly playing out how that something may have died, wondering if it suffered, feeling horrible for hours. Then on the other hand it could be over someone telling me to ‚Äúchill‚Äù if I start to get a little ‚Äúworked up‚Äù about something and then I‚Äôm thinking ‚Äú I wonder if they think I am annoying‚Äù or ‚Äúgod I do need to chill I sound crazy‚Äù etc and i feel like these issues I‚Äôm having are so by the book and super common but they feel so suffocating.

    "text": "Stomach pain Hello! So I have the type of anxiety where my stomach will start hurting and the urge to go to the bathroom is like crazy. I've been to gastrologists, I've been to two different therapists, and I've told my doctor. I was told it was probably IBS, after they tried all the tests they could including colonscopy and endoscopy, but they havent officially diagnosed me and the medication they give me doesn't work. Fiber doesnt work. Nothing is helping me with these panic attacks I get. Because I don't panic until I feel that urge to go. The cramping of my stomach and the diarrhea that needs to urgently come out. I've tried breathing, which works 1 in 10 times, and I've tried the 5 senses rule. I've tried talking to keep myself occupied. Nothing works. I feel like Im going to explode from the inside. I have to exhale dramatically sometimes because it gets too much. I need a bathroom and sometimes it's not always there which freaks me out even more. I immediately go walking because I can't just stand still and sitting makes it worse. It's 50/50 chance that when I do reach a bathroom, I will use it. Panic doesn't go away when I do unless it's alot. If I don't use it, it won't leave me alone until I reached my destination or I'm home. I spend about an hour everyday on the toilet because it does eventually come out if I have something there and if nothing comes out, it reassures me that I'm empty. But if it's too early, like 3 am to 7 am, I am not reassured at all. It's too early to have a bowel movement and spending an hour on the toilet won't work in those hours. I have woken at 5 once, spent a very long time waiting on the toilet but nothing came out, went outside, and as soon as I stopped at a bus stop my stomach was hurting and I had to use it really bad. I panicked and walked back and forward because moving helps me but it wouldn't go away so I ended up breaking down. I spent an hour and 20 minutes in agony of stomach pain, the urge to use the bathroom, and the feeling of needing to breathe more until I eventually got up and went back home. As soon as I got home and went on the toilet, absolutely nothing came out. It happens if it's too early in the morning. I say 95% of the time it happens if I'm outside before 10 am. The remaining time is if I eat alot or I eat something spicy or greasy and I go outside immediately after. It always happens when I'm outside or when I'm home and someone's in the bathroom at the moment. It is ruining my life, I have so many events that require me to be early. I hate letting everyone down. I tried dieting in January. I thought it worked but just 2 days ago I had an attack again and I started crying. I had the urge to run and I was just nearly seconds away from screaming at the bus driver to let me off. It didn't go away even when I arrived at my doctors appointment at 9:30 am. Stomach kept cramping and I kept running to use the bathroom but I was still nervous because I couldn't spend my time in there because patients would need it for urine samples. So I know the reason behind them. I'm terrified of soiling myself. The humiliation, shame, and the stares would be horrifying. It'll never leave me alone. And I hate when people tell me to just let it happen. It won't make it all go away. I am seriously considering adult diapers. At 23 years old. I'll add somethings that might or might not be relevant: I used to be terrified of toilets growing up. I would soil myself at home because of how scared I was. I would also have many bowel movements that were hard as stone and huge. I was told it was because I didn't drink enough water. I have some aunts and a grandparent with issues of panic attacks. None of them have the urge to use the bathroom though. This all started from food poisoning when I was 19. I ate everything my siblings ate except for this Dunkin Donuts Coffee. I believe that's what made me sick because I spent an entire week in agony with urges to go and stomach pain. I went to a doctor and I forgot what he told me but I recieved no help. I just need some advice. What has worked for anyone with a similar issue? Should I try anxiety meds? I have no support and my therapist and Doctors just tell me to eat better but that's what I've been doing!!"

I think this is what might have started my anxiety problem. From then on, I understood that not everyone comes back when they leave, and the uncertainty of it all made me crack. But that‚Äôs not what I wanted to talk about. My family keeps stray cats. We always have, I‚Äôm used to it all but the important thing here is that my dad and stepmom believe that cats should be able to go outside and roam. And before you say anything I‚Äôve had many many fights and talks about it with them and they are pretty stubborn on it. With that you might imagine I‚Äôve lost many cats. And I loved each one of them. Each one was a friend, and a hope that this time they‚Äôll stay with me, only for them to go missing, or drown, or get hit by a car. The longest I‚Äôve had a cat was probably something close to 3 years. And that hurt. Anyways, because of this I‚Äôve started subconsciously linking cats to death. When I see videos of kittens all I can think of is ‚Äûdeath, they will die soon‚Äù which I think is some sort of mechanism to not get attached, and to prepare for the thing that my life has taught me will happen. Either way - if anyone has any tips on how I could undo this cycle‚Ä¶ please share. I want to be able to look at a cat and not think about it being hit by a car immediately."

I almost never actually think anxious thoughts, and most often my anxiety is just a vague, albeit potentially overwhelming feeling. Even worse, I often get just the physical symptoms of anxiety without feeling anxious at all. It's the most bizzare thing ever. I am not thinking about anything stressful or worrying while my throat feels like it's closing up and my lungs feel like I can't breathe. My conscious mind is completely calm but my body is in full fight or flight mode. I think it might be caused by some sort of instinctual emotional suppression, which is something I'm embarrasingly good at, as my default response to negative emotions is most often to squash them down, maybe dissociate and let them pass. This is why I get so freaked out when I get that \"wave of anxiety\" feeling when you feel like the whole world is closing in on you. I was wondering if anybody else experiences this?

    "text": "My Own Worst Enemy Well. I suppose a lot of people new to this sub have a longer backstory than can be put into one post. But here goes mine in short form. I (M28) have been dealing with terrible anxiety, centric around romantic relationships, since my very first one, as a highschool sophomore. Undoubtedly, it stems from huge fears of rejection, and my mother not being in my life from 6th grade, until I became a 22 year old homeowner. As well as a divorce with the mother of my one son. I'm a people pleaser with mommy issues and a bad image of how marriage ends. Fast foreward to last year, my current relationship (F27) was going down the tubes, and we suffered from a dead bedroom. A failed attempt at opening the relationship, residual feelings and hidden text messages from the people we tried to connect with, and a near breakup, left my trust broken a bit and left me with panic attacks about being left or cheated on. But she met with an online therapist often enough, and is on medication for anxiety/trauma. I started therapy in the summer time and from there, we grabbed the shock paddles, jumpstarted the heart, and learned what it would take to keep this relationship alive. Lately, things have been looking up, panic attacks are infrequent/non-existent and we're reclaiming our bedroom, reclaiming our own free time, and our wonderful relationship, step by step, slowly but surely. At the begining of this week, we found ourselves in the mood to send each other nude and nude adjacent pictures. Couldn't have been more excited. And then she sent a picture, that was taken a while back, when she was just feelin herself and wanted to take a hot picture, but it was definitely taken from our bed, at night time, and she sent it to me during the daytime, while she was out on the road. And BOOM. A terrible anxious spiral overcame me and I was thrown back into last summer where every move, every text, every thing that she did, and didn't tell me about or explain was a personal attack. I was SURE that she took it a calendar year ago and recycled it to me to humor the situation. I waited a good 3 days to gain some mental clarity and have a session with my therapist. And last night I thought I found the best way to ask her, (not accuse her) of when the picture might have been taken and if I was the only one who saw it. And she still got very hurt and insulted that I would ever assume she would do that to me. Reasonable. But. I also felt like I could never bring my problems to her, without her becoming the victim and assuming I see her as pure evil. Now I'm just mad that I was gaslighting myself and may have ruined or perhaps, reset my chances of sending racy pictures, and I don't know how to make her feel like A: I still love the idea of nudes, B: I definitely didn't feel that way, from a place of malice, but more out of fear. But also C: I still feel heard and respected when I bring her an \"I feel\" statement about a certain event. TL;DR long history of relationship centered anxiety. Received a nude-ish picture that didn't sit right with me, due to said anxiety, and tried to respectfully explain why I came home from work in a panicked state. It turns out I gaslit myself into thinking she was cheating and now I feel dumb and she feels insulted. I hope I didn't ruin my chances of getting more pics."

I‚Äôm 30F diagnosed with anxiety/depression/ADHD/BPD and have been in therapy for many years and have done a lot of healing internally. I am married and have immediate family who I interact with regularly as well as some very good childhood friends who I see on occasion. With that being said, I am super isolated from my community at large (since even before covid-19) and also struggle to connect with others online. I am terrified of trying to build new relationships and feel the urge to hide because of the *potential* judgement over one thing or another. I‚Äôm also scared to cause conflict (which I know is normal and healthy) because I‚Äôm afraid the person on the other end will not want to work it out with me. 1) I often take it personally and 2) I tell myself that they don‚Äôt want to work it out with me because I‚Äôm unworthy and maybe I‚Äôm just not meant to be in community with others. And that is very painful. Ultimately I know that there‚Äôs no guarantee that anybody will like me or take to me. But the fear of rejection is so strong within me that I‚Äôm not even willing to try.

I‚Äôm trying to take the next step but it‚Äôs the biggest, scariest one. Idk if anybody has any advice or support to share.

    "text": "Weird changing headache for weeks? So as a background on me, I am a 27 year old male, and I have had pretty bad anxiety issues my whole life, and many in my family have similar issues. This current bout of stress has gradually ruined my sleep and eating, and has caused me like 5 panic attacks a week for like 6 weeks, and some fun depersonalization/disassociation type of stuff, to be totally frank. I was already been under a lot of underlying stress up to this point also. I was hoping to share my experience to get some insight/hear similar stories from others, and maybe some peace of mind from the experience of others that steers me away from worrying that I am dying 24/7. (I do have doctor's appointments lined up also for the record, but I can't talk to my main doc til Monday). Also apologies in advance for how long and rambly this is gonna be; I am trying to paint a complete picture here. I will try to keep this updated as well. So here's the scoop. I have been very stressed the past few months especially. It started around the beginning of January when I noticed my left eye had poorer vision than my right eye (particularly at distances and not close up). I keep spending way too much time switching back and forth between my eyes just to make sure it was actually different, and eventually I thought about it less even though I realized my vison was poorer in my left eye. It was kinda hard to notice if I was using both my eyes, so like I eventually just went about my business, but it worries me that I don't know how long it was like that, or how quickly that developed. I also worry about if it is a part of my other symptoms. Going forward, the next month I had an incident that was very stress inducing and left me crying for awhile, and I got a headache around my right eye that just didn't seem to want to go away. It was there all night, and before bed it switched to my left eye, but when I woke up it was back in my right eye, and it was in that eye most of the time. Eventually I made an assumption that maybe all my screen time was the cause, so I avoided screens for days. Gradually my head got better, but not 100% better, and the length of the headache stressed me very badly because I have never had a headache last more than a day pretty much. It never went away fully despite feeling pretty alright for like 2 weeks generally speaking. And actually sometimes I felt like sinus burning (but no congestion), and also other times occasionally tooth pain ( I have some cavities I have been getting worked on since I had noticed tooth pains leading up to all this. Also I still have all my wisdom teeth, and sometimes I worry if my upper wisdom teeth which have not popped out could be having issues or something, but I had an x-ray sometime prior, and the dentist didn't seem to notice anything off I guess. So then it stayed at that baseline for the next couple weeks, and also sometimes in the middle of the night I'd wake up with the left side of my neck feeling sore, and also feeling a headache in the lower back of my head. This happened a handful of times, but not every time. I also started feeling occasional chest pains (which has happened for me in the past during high stress). I went to the doctor and told them about everything I was dealing with and they didn't seem too worried about the head stuff. They gave me a prescription for Prozac, sent me for bloodwork, and ordered a heart scan. The bloodwork came back fine except for a slightly low bun/creatinine ratio (8), I have yet to do the heart scan, and I haven't touched the Prozac yet because I have been too anxious to try it (plus also I wanted to be able to pay attention to my symptoms and not get side effects mixed up with my symptoms, or worsen my symptoms). I saw an eye doctor and he said my eyes were healthy, but that my left eye has slightly poor vision, and my right eye has astigmatism (OD: Plano spehere, -0.50 cylinder, axis 175. OS: -0.50 sphere, D.S cylinder.), and said I should get glasses to use as needed, but that my vision was mostly fine. A couple weeks ago now I started feeling a strange pressure at the top of my head that popped up pretty suddenly (feeling something like a vein maybe? it is hard to describe). It came on gradually over like a minute or so, and has been constant ever since I think, but sometimes when I wake up I feel like it might not be there until I start thinking about it, and also I sometimes forget about it when wearing my headset, or like a hat or something. For a few days it had felt like the pressure at the top of my head had a burning sort of sensation as well, but that has gone away since (it did also come back for a short while, but then went away again). Around the 14th and 15th I had a headache when I got up from bed, but one lasted like an hour and was the back and front of my head, and the other lasted a few hours. Lately I have been finding myself feeling nauseous on and off, and occasionally this like dizzy headsick feeling. Sometimes my head feels hot. And here and these I have felt momentary dull pains in my forehead near one eye or the other. Also the past couple days I have been feeling this sort of \"vertigo\" kind of thing where it feels like my surroundings are very slightly moving or shifting or something. The past couple days I have also felt this faint tingling sort of sensation down my left arm into my pinky. Last night I had gotten myself feeling mostly fine actually, but then I started feeling this weird sensation with my left eyelid where it sort of felt like it was kinda harder to blink very slightly. Like the eyelid skin was getting folded up in a funny way or something Idunno. Was still feeling the weird left arm/hand tingling thing too, and at also for a while last night my left ear was hurting a fair bit (like the ear itself, and not like inside). Yesterday I also thought that my vision overall felt as poor as my left eye for some reason, and I woke up feeling sick today. I tried playing an FPS game for an hour or so, and it felt off visually like the whole time, and then I got quite headsick feeling, but after I stopped playing that got a fair bit better. As I have been writing this I think it has lessened even more actually, and eventually got better. Though now (when I was writing this last night) the right side of my head hurts from like my eyebrow up to the front top of my head, but then as fast as I mention that it kinda chills out. My head does feel hot in this moment also, but I haven't checked my temp at all because I am afraid of seeing a high temperature and triggering another panic attack basically. Another important note for the past like week is my eyes keep feeling sore to the touch basically. Or like if I look around too much or something I will notice it. As of a little bit later also I noticed my left eye feeling sting-y feeling and being sorta watery and also looking red. More recently (like the past day) I have felt an on and off strange sinus pressure sort of dull headache, and had a slightly burning nose, and feeling like my head feels uncomfortably warm. I went to bed at a dumb time and woke up with the top back of my neck feeling achey. Same with my forehead too I guess. Anywho that's probably the entire story I think. I have just been freaking out about this daily, stressing myself into not eating good enough or sleeping good enough, and it's just been awful really. The head symptoms have been really mild though. The first week my head hurt quite a bit to the point where I was like taking tylenol and using an ice pack for a couple days, If I knew for a fact that I was fine and nothing was wrong with my head, then this would be totally managable, but my anxiety is off the charts and so I have been miserable. I just want to be fine again, but after 6 weeks it feels like this is just my life now until it gets worse, actually for real better, or until I get answers. My mom keeps telling me it's just stress and anxiety because she's had similar (often worse) stuff too, but it's hard to be logical when stuff feels so weird and constant. Short-ish version: Head issues for like 6 weeks straight. Vision changes a month prior, then mild lingering (changing) headache that started off bad but then mostly got better and now just comes and goes, top of head pressure (sometimes burning), slight vertigo/dizziness, headsick feeling that comes and goes, weird tingling in left arm/hand(left side of left hand), warm feeling head, sinus pressure and burning nose sometimes, eye soreness (strain?), neck pains in the night, and maybe some other stuff, over the course of 6 weeks, and it has had me stressing big time."

    "text": "Benzo or propranolol for long-haul flight? Hey everyone I‚Äôve been dealing with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) for a while now, but through exposure and persistence, I‚Äôve managed to almost completely overcome it. What used to be a debilitating issue, at one point causing agoraphobia, has now become more of a manageable nuisance in daily life. That said, some situations still trigger intense anxiety for me, and one of the worst is flying. In less than a week, I‚Äôll be flying alone from Europe to the US. It‚Äôs a long-haul flight, and I‚Äôm already feeling extremely anxious. What‚Äôs frustrating is that for the first 25 years of my life, I had zero issues with flying. This all started about a year ago, seemingly out of nowhere. Originally, my anxiety centered around the fear of ‚Äúgoing crazy.‚Äù Over time, that‚Äôs shifted into more generalized social fears, like the fear of embarrassing myself in public, passing out, hyperventilating, or losing control. While on airplanes it is however on a different level. I get intrusive ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù thoughts like: ‚Ä¢ What if I freak out in front of everyone? Causing embarrassment and an unpleasant flight for everyone on board. ‚Ä¢ What if I go crazy and try to open the airplane door mid-flight? ‚Ä¢ What if I cause the plane to make an emergency landing because of a panic attack? Spoiling everyone‚Äôs travel on board. ‚Ä¢ What if I become a danger to myself or others? It‚Äôs not about the plane crashing, I‚Äôm not typically scared of that. It‚Äôs more the bizarre, surreal nature of being 30,000 feet in the air that triggers a sense of derealization and claustrophobia. Being ‚Äútrapped‚Äù for 9 hours without a clear escape makes everything worse. These thoughts then spiral into each other: the claustrophobia feeds the derealization, which makes me think I‚Äôm losing my mind, which spikes my heart rate and creates a full panic loop. Even though I generally never actually leave a situation even at the onset of panic, I always power through, just knowing that I could leave helps a lot. But on a plane, that safety valve doesn‚Äôt exist. That‚Äôs what terrifies me. When this all began, my GP prescribed me benzos, but I‚Äôve never taken them. I‚Äôve always preferred to face things head-on through exposure. But now I‚Äôm unsure. I‚Äôve read that benzos can help in the moment but might also cause derealization or a rebound in anxiety afterwards and worst case psychosis (my ultimate fear). I‚Äôm also hesitant because of my past, between ages 20‚Äì23, I used marijuana heavily, almost daily. A year and a half after quitting, this anxiety hit me out of nowhere when I randomly out of nowhere experienced derealization for the first time without knowing what it was. That history makes me fearful of taking anything that alters my state of mind. I still carry a lingering fear of psychosis, even though I‚Äôve never had any signs of it. So here I am asking this nice community the following; Do I finally take a benzo just for the flight? Should I try something milder like propranolol? Or just grit my teeth and push through like I would do on ground? Or‚Ä¶ should I get drunk before the flight (I know, not ideal, but I don‚Äôt drink often either)? I‚Äôm afraid that taking a benzo might make things worse by giving me rebound anxiety as well as derealization for days after during the trip itself, but I also don‚Äôt know if I can mentally handle 9 hours in the air in a sensitized state, only to arrive in the US already burned out from the anxiety. Would love to hear from anyone who‚Äôs been through something similar. What worked for you? ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî TL;DR: Flying triggers intense anxiety for me‚Äîclaustrophobia, derealization, and intrusive thoughts which raises my adrenaline and makes me ultimately panic. I have a 9-hour flight soon and I‚Äôm torn between taking a benzo, asking for propranolol, drinking, or just powering through. Looking for advice from anyone who‚Äôs dealt with this."

    "text": "Shortness of Breath? Check Posture Disclaimer: I am not a doctor nor do I work in the medical field. However, I have experienced something very interesting and I want to talk about it. This entire week has been absolutely crazy for me. I ended up landing in the ER once. I experienced symptoms including but not limited to: * shortness of breath when standing up * chest pain * dizziness * headaches * sweaty palms / feet * loss of apetite * frequent urination * etc All of these were kicked off because I noticed shortness of breath over the weekend. Then I got anxious, anxiety produced more symptoms, and I read into those symptoms too much. Then I I went to the ER scared of a heart attack, but everything was fine. In fact doctors said everything is perfect, and it looks like I just had bad anxiety. A few days pass, most symptoms went away since I stopped reading into them and started ignoring them. One symptom however remained: the one that started it all I can't beat this subjective feeling of shortness of breath. This kicks in more anxiety, etc. Then browsing some Reddit posts, I saw a link to a study that showed even a slight anterior pelvic tilt can cause difficulty catching one's breath. I was so anxious about it and it not going away, that I was not sure what was wrong with me and started getting really scared. Simply adjusting my posture has already mostly fixed my subjective feeling. Now, I am going to be working on my posture properly. And why would I not have bad posture? I have been working from home sitting like a monkey on my chair for over 3 years since graduating college. Everyone -- please don't forget about the importance of proper posture and exercise."

I tried ssri (i think fluoxitine and sertraline) and both made me irratic (just everywhere all at once but excitable) but also really effected my \"drive\" and messed up my periods real bad I tried beta blockers (if thats the heart one) and they just didnt do much/ added different symptoms instead. I kinda decided to not be medicated but im becoming more and more of a shut in rather than getting better. Also having nights where i overanalyse everything or get some specific parts of my issues spring up. But im still working its just... im a little stressful and i feel it probably makes my co workers angry. Im just curious how it feels for others/what others think. I will be speaking to a doctor but being honest they tend to promise the workd then make things worse so i like having a non doctor oppinion too. For those curious so it doesnt have to be asked: the diagnosis i have are: Severe anxiety, Severe depression and ptsd, i did try counceling/ therapy but i kept having weird encounters or didnt click with the person. I tried for 4 years and did try most places i qualified for before deciding id just live without it. Also i tend to forget i have appointments and thats a waste of everyones time."

    "text": "How to stop feeling anxious over blood pressure So I've made posts talking about how I have chronic hypertension after having a baby in August. Since then it's caused a ton of health anxiety and ptsd which I'm in weekly therapy for. We've been doing exposure therapy where I take my bp with him which helped a lot and will hopefully help me get over my fear of getting my bp taken. I use to see my doctor every 2-4 weeks for bp check ups and medication adjustments but the past 2 I've had, my bp was good so he said to monitor at home from now on. Which I hadn't been able to do since yesterday because my anxiety spikes every time I get it taken. Therapy went well and my bp kept fluctuating between 127/80s and 90s to 150/90 which was the highest it got but then went back down to the 120s. Then I got the courage to take it at home and and it was 110/89 and I felt really happy cuz that's the lowest the top number has been in so long. My usual is in the 120s. Even though my bottom number was a little high, it still made me feel relieved. Then today I got the courage to take it a few times. The first reading I got was great. 127/80. Then I took it a few more times and it just kept going up from there because I was getting more anxious. The last reading I got was 147/76. Bottom number is good but top number was high. This caused me to have a panic attack and I couldn't calm down and I just kept spiraling. I couldn't calm down enough to mediate and do mindfulness so I immediately took a cold shower which seemed to do the calm me down. But now every time I'm anxious, I can't help but think about how high my bp might be. If anyone has any advice or words of encouragement, I'd really appreciate it. Thank you in advance!"

It was early afternoon and I had summoned an Uber driver from my home to take me to a friends house to watch some basketball about 25-30 minutes away. He arrives, greetings were fine, asked me how my day was, standard stuff. Not much talking between us, and honestly I don't mind. Car was clean as well! &#x200B; About 20 minutes into our drive I notice he's sort of glancing in the rearview at me like he wants to say something, he starts kind of breathing deep breaths and says: \"Sorry I have to pull over.\" I reply: \"Ok is everything alright?.\" He says \"Sorry having a panic attack.\" I remained calm and told him, \"Ok that's fine man, I have panic attacks too, I'm not going anywhere important, take your time.\" Luckily he was able to pullover, we were in a residential area with a hill next to us and side walk. He wasn't really speaking much at this point and I told him: \"I know when I have these attacks I like to be alone, don't worry I'm not in a hurry, I'll be over here on the curb playing games on my phone take your time, let me know if you want to call anyone.\" &#x200B; About 20-30 minutes later, I told him I could drive him the rest of the way so he could finish his trip and make money, he said to give him a few more minutes. He was able to calm down enough to drive us. We arrived fine, I tipped him told him this is my number if he needs to talk with someone with anxiety as well and went on our ways. I think fresh air and giving him space helped him instead of worrying about finishing his trip with me. Anyways just a small story I had today. Cheers"

I‚Äôm in the UK and have just woke up to all of this positivity. I knew reddit was an awesome place but this has just confirmed it even more. We all deserve contentment, thank you so much üíï So after years of childhood trauma, anxiety and depression I finally got to a stage where I could afford decent therapy and had my first session today. My therapist seems really nice and her little room was the perfect environment for me to feel comfortable talking. At the end she asked me what I wanted from therapy. As I was telling her all about me and my life, I was constantly worried about her thinking I was overreacting, judging my stories or thinking them not serious enough to require therapy and that I was just a weak person. She looked at my blankly and said ‚Äòis it a big deal for you?‚Äô I said, ‚Äòyes, massively‚Äô and she just simply replied ‚Äòwell then it‚Äôs a big deal...‚Äô, and just shrugged her shoulders and started talking about our next session. Honestly it was like an epiphany. I realised that if something is a big deal in MY universe, then it is a big deal because it‚Äôs me that matters and someone else not thinking it‚Äôs serious does NOT invalidate that. I‚Äôm always so anxious that my problems will seem silly to someone else, but actually if they really care about helping you get through it, they won‚Äôt judge the nature of the problem but try and help you through it anyway because they know it‚Äôs a serious problem to you.

    "text": "Anxiety Pro Tip: Anxiety thrives on your avoidance. If you have an anxiety-provoking task to do, make it your first task of the day. Otherwise, it'll only start to feel scarier and harder to complete in your mind. Avoiding the anxiety-provoking task feels good in the short term because your brain feels like it has avoided some kind of threat. This is one of the reasons why procrastination feels so good! However, avoiding the task just reinforces your belief that the task *is* a threatening one, so the anxiety gets more intense the next time you come to it. Making it your first task will eliminate this vicious cycle altogether. You'll likely feel better as you'll get a sense of achievement from \"beating\" the anxiety-provoking thing. There is also the added bonus that it won't be nagging the back of your mind for the rest of the day! All credit for this tip goes to u/TomClinPsy who posted it elsewhere but it was removed for some reason. Luckily I had screenshot it because it felt so profound to me."

You may not actually know what you're doing but being confident will convince all those around you. With anxiety, you will be constantly doubting yourself, thinking you can't do it. Trying to talk yourself out of daunting situations, and as such struggling to grow as a person. It can be hard for people to understand how much of a disadvantage this puts you in. It's harder to make friends and socialise, date, work, and even things like phoning the doctor, driving, and shopping can feel like too much to handle. Constant anxiety is so incredibly unhealthy for your psyche yet people without anxiety often can't understand this. Instead we appear a bit shy, maybe even lazy, but they don't know what it feels like to have this affliction"

It was my time to go, I had cars behind me, I paid and I just couldn't do it. So I got out of my car and asked the car behind me if I they could back up and let me leave as I was having a panic attack and that they could have my paid car wash is they wanted. Turns out it was a mother and her teenage son and immediately this mom is like \"would you like me to go in the car wash with you if that would make you feel better?\" and as I was holding up the line I said sure and so she had her son drive her car and she hopped in my tiny two seater miata, and just sat and talked to me while I drove through the car wash. We just talked about Christmas and she was telling me how she had to sell her house and how her son liked my car and I'm just sitting there shaking like a leaf. And soon enough the car wash was over, we survived, my car didn't break down, and I dropped her back off with her son. One of the most wholesome experiences of my life. Im going to try to find her on my towns Facebook page, try and give her some grocery and car wash money for the trouble."

    "text": "I took a blanket and a hot water bottle out to a homeless man sleeping under the stairs on my apartment building. I'm shaking and feel faint but am proud I did it. It's about 2 degrees Celsius at night where I live right now, for context. As I arrived home late this evening I saw a homeless man sleeping under some building insulation fabric in the outdoor stairwell of my apartment building. As soon as I got inside my nice toasty apartment I couldn't stop thinking about how the poor guy must be freezing. I couldn't help but feel such an aching sadness that so many people just would walk past, not doing anything because of their discomfort, just like the discomfort I was feeling. I decided fuck it, show this guy the care and common decency you would want if you were in a similar situation. I found a spare blanket I had, nice and fuzzy and warm, and a hot water bottle I don't use and filled it up with hot boiled water. I was shaking so hard at this point and almost chickened out. Barely getting my key in the door to unlock my deadbolt as I was shaking so much, I forced myself to walk outside to him with the blanket and hot water bottle. I apologised for disturbing him, and simply said he must be freezing and to keep both items. He told me I was a gem, and thanked me. Im back inside my apartment now, feeling like I'm about to faint from the adrenalin and starting to cry from the stress of the situation, but I am so proud of myself. I conquered the anxiety today in favour of my gut feeling and desire to act on my belief of kindness to all. I feel I'm making a big deal out of literally just being a decent human, but it was a big deal for me and my anxiety so I wanted to share the success."

I constantly fantasise and I take refuge in books and TV shows. I'm very emphatic too, and I usually imagen how is does the characters feels. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I know what is real life and what isn‚Äôt. But I took comfort in imaginary worlds and usually overindulge in this feelings and worlds. I feel like life is extremely unpleasant more of the time. When I was younger this could had been seen as \"daydreaming\" but I‚Äôm almost 22 years old now‚Ä¶ and I don‚Äôt know if this is still a good thing. Edit: Hey! I'm so so happy for all the support in the comments. I just wanted to say thank you to you all!

    "text": "Does anybody else have anxiety on your days off because you are ‚Äúwasting‚Äù it doing nothing? I have been like this for years but I feel it‚Äôs been worse lately because of COVID and the fact that I‚Äôve been working from home. I always felt anxious/guilty when I would relax, hangout inside and play video games on my days off by myself. I felt like I was supposed to be doing something productive, exercising the dog, etc. But I was working a more labor intensive job before. I now have a desk call center job and have been stuck working from home since March. So on my days off, if I don‚Äôt have plans, I‚Äôm still home and feel like I should be out doing something. But some weekends I just want to do nothing, even if it‚Äôs beautiful out (I usually pray for rainy days when I‚Äôm off so I feel less guilty.) I also hate the heat so when it‚Äôs too hot, I don‚Äôt want to be outside. AND I usually get house chores done on my first day off so I can relax later but I still am anxious all day because I‚Äôm relaxing and playing video games. I feel like I waste my all my days off thinking of things I SHOULD have done and then when I go back to work, I feel like I wasted all my days off thinking of things I should be doing instead of mentally relaxing. I‚Äôve honestly found myself either drinking or getting High more on my days off just so I can forget these feelings and relax. *Edit to add, I‚Äôm also more introverted so making plans with friends can be exhausting but I do it and have fun every time. Recently all my weekends have been jam packed with plans so I wouldn‚Äôt feel like this but apparently it doesn‚Äôt work that way!"

They're not constantly worrying or feeling overwhelmed. They don't have panic attacks. They're able to do whatever they feel like doing! Like, it's so insane to me there are people who can travel the world, or even just function in their day to day lives. I've only ever known life with anxiety. Although I guess that's better than living a \"normal\" life then developing severe anxiety, I just wish I could have known what it felt to be fearless at some point.

As a kid it made sense, I had super strict parents, but it's followed me into my adult life. Like at work, I'm always anxious I'm going to get 'in trouble'.

And yet I find myself always looking over my shoulder and feeling guilt and anxiety building if anything is going wrong or if I slack off a bit after getting work done.

Always heard about my friends going out to parties, but I never went to one myself. In university, I avoided going out with friends, and mostly kept to myself. At the time, I didn't realize I had anxiety. But now, when I look back, knowing that I had anxiety and depression, it makes me really sad that I missed out on socializing and parties. Even though deep down I feel like I would have felt uncomfortable at them anyways. Not sure if that makes sense or not. It's sort of feeling like I wish I could have enjoyed them even though the reality is that I probably wouldn't have enjoyed them much even if I had had the opportunity to socialize more."

He gave me purpose when I felt I had none. He gave me unconditional love. I didn‚Äôt have to worry about my insecurities around him. He loved me as I was. He was with me when I hit my rock bottom. He was with me during my years long recovery cheering me on and providing support during the low times. He gave me companionship when I would isolate because the world was too much to take. He was my spirit animal. He had anxiety too and took Prozac. He was excited when I got home and would cry when I left, sometimes when I even just left the room. He loved me and I loved him and I will forever miss him and cherish the blessing he was in my life. Edit: thank you everyone for your kind words. They do provide comfort. And thank you for the golds. I have a great support system and a wonderful fianc√©. She was with me at the vet when we had to put him to sleep.

    "text": "How I Beat my Anxiety Disorder and Advice on How to do so Yourself So if you‚Äôre reading this and currently in the midst of an anxiety disorder, let me start by saying I know how you feel. I‚Äôve had panic attacks where the adrenaline rushes just don‚Äôt stop, I‚Äôve been nauseated and unable to eat or drink for days on end, I‚Äôve felt so short of breath it was like drowning above water, had the jitters and the lump in my throat. I‚Äôve also had all of the uncomfortable mental symptoms. I‚Äôve dissociated for almost a full day multiple times, I‚Äôve had racing, intrusive thoughts that lasted weeks and sometimes months at a time. And I‚Äôve felt like I was going crazy. A lot. But I‚Äôm here to tell you my struggle with my anxiety disorder is over. After almost a year of conscious and concerted effort, all of the worst symptoms of my anxiety are completely gone. Some of the more mild ones still appear from time to time; I‚Äôll get fatigued or dizzy/foggy maybe once every few weeks, but this happens so infrequently (and becomes less frequent with each occurrence) that it doesn‚Äôt really bug me. I was also on medication (an SSRI since day one and a benzo for the first few months) and am in the process of tapering off . So I wanted to write a post about how to get over each stage of your anxiety, mainly because I know I really would have appreciated this kind of guidance when I first sought help in late April of last year. If you want a summary of things you can do regardless of what stage you‚Äôre at, scroll to the bottom and check the paragraph in bold. I don‚Äôt discuss responses to specific symptoms here, just a general approach. If you‚Äôre looking for tactics for specific symptoms, check out the list of books I left in the second section. I think the first one does a particularly good job of addressing every symptom, but you can try the third if you don‚Äôt feel it makes enough of a difference. Before you read, I want to mention something once so I don‚Äôt have to later on. Recovery is going to be like a rollercoaster. Some days you‚Äôll feel like you made incredible progress, and others you‚Äôll have difficulty even doing simple tasks. It‚Äôs going to be a lot of two steps forward, one step back. Sometimes it‚Äôll even be two steps forward, two steps back. But even those times are okay, because they serve as proof that you are capable of improving. Just know that once you start to give effort, things will start gradually getting better. So here it is. My comprehensive guide to recovering from an anxiety disorder. If you‚Äôre at a constant 9/10 - 10/10 anxiety and can‚Äôt calm down: At this stage, you‚Äôre either in the middle of panic attack (which lasts up to 60 minutes) or you have GAD and are constantly anxious. I was diagnosed with GAD and Pure-O but I‚Äôve had maaaaaany panic attacks, so I know this advice will work for both. **1.** Stop trying to fight your anxiety symptoms. Understand that the best thing you can do for your body right now is just let it run its course. This is the basis of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) which is one of the types of therapy currently used to treat anxiety disorders. To do this: * Don‚Äôt try to stop any symptoms you are experiencing. This is infinitely easier said than done at first, but with practice you‚Äôll be able to pick this up fairly quickly. When I was first having constant adrenaline rushes, I kept trying to consciously stop them. This was actually making things worse. The more you try to fight your symptoms, the more worried you become, which in turn causes your system to release more of the stress-causing hormones, causing your symptoms to become worse. The best thing you can do at this point is wait it out and let your body tire itself out. * Questions, doubts, and fear will come up. When they do, remind yourself that this is a totally normal process that your body is going through, and try to rest in the anxiety. It may be difficult, but try to ease into the symptoms. This was initially what helped my adrenaline rushes decrease in severity and frequency. * If this isn‚Äôt working and you find your symptoms are still persisting and won‚Äôt stop, ask for more. As the DARE Response (discussed later) puts it, run towards your symptoms. If you‚Äôve ever read a book on ACT, this step is likely in there. When you ask your body to make your symptoms worse, you‚Äôll find it can‚Äôt. The symptoms of anxiety are driven by a subconscious worry, and not something you can control. Keep running towards it until your symptoms gradually begin to ease, then move on to step 2. In case you‚Äôre interested, the clinical term for this is ‚Äúarousal reappraisal.‚Äù It‚Äôs not discussed very often, but I found it to be very helpful. **2.** Do anything you possibly can to get your mind off of the anxiety. In older forms of anxiety treatment, this kind of thing was referred to as a distraction tactic, but in The DARE Response, Barry McDonagh calls it being ‚Äúengaged.‚Äù This basically means do whatever you can to focus your mind on something other than your anxiety. Regardless of what level of anxiety you‚Äôre at, this is incredibly important. **Your anxiety is most easily fueled when you focus on it, so do whatever you can to move your attention to something else.** Again, MUCH easier said than done, and your mind will fight you at every stage. But it‚Äôs an integral part of recovery. When I first started out, I found short activities the most helpful, like picking up my guitar/cajon and playing a song or two, or doing homework. **3.** Give it time. Your system can‚Äôt sustain anxiety levels this high for an extended period of time unless you consciously fuel it. If you are properly easing into your symptoms and engaging yourself in other activities you‚Äôll eventually calm down to the next phase of anxiety recovery. **4.** If recommended by your physician, a benzo might help. Benzos are basically nervous system relaxants, but they‚Äôre no magic pill. When I took my first dose of valium, I didn‚Äôt feel a thing. It took a few days of constant dosing to see any effect. Benzos are fine to use in the very beginning, but I will issue a warning about them: try to use them as sparingly as possible. Benzos are not meant to be used in the long term, and if the first thing you do when feeling anxious is reach for your benzo, you‚Äôll have real difficulty recovering in the later stages. But since at this point, you‚Äôre in a constant state of panic, they‚Äôre a great way to ease you down to the next lowest stage of anxiety, so you can start focusing on the long term. **5.** Journal. I don‚Äôt recommend this as much beyond this stage, as I‚Äôve found it doesn‚Äôt really help all that much. But in the beginning stages of my experience with GAD, I found journaling to be an indispensable asset to really figure out what I was going through. Just write out whatever you‚Äôre thinking or feeling. It‚Äôs a great what to get out of your head for at least a little bit. **6.** Get up and do something to release all your pent up adrenaline. Walk around the block, take a stretch break at work. You don‚Äôt need to be doing a full workout at this point, just something to help you use the jitters and adrenaline you‚Äôre getting for something productive. **7.** This one may seem rather minor, but it helped me a lot in the beginning: fix your posture. It‚Äôs much easier to feel short of breath when you‚Äôre in a position that doesn‚Äôt let you breath easily. If you‚Äôre lying down, lay on your back. If you‚Äôre sitting, sit up straight. Once you‚Äôve thoroughly calmed down from this point (this took me about three or four weeks), you can move on to the next step. Constant 6 - 8/10 with occasional panic attacks: If you‚Äôre at this phase, you are probably still experiencing physical manifestations of your anxiety, like jitters, nausea, jelly legs, shortness of breath, and so on. But you‚Äôre not in constant freakout mode anymore. You can make logical decisions aimed more at long term recovery because rather than being focused on your anxiety 100% of the time, you pay attention to it 80 - 90% of the time. You may be leaving the house occasionally but your symptoms are still bad enough that they keep you at home most of the time. So here‚Äôs what to do at this stage: **1. Start reading or listening to books on what you‚Äôre going through**. The more you understand the subtleties of what‚Äôs going on in your brain and body, the better you‚Äôll be able fix them. Read up on therapy techniques as they‚Äôll be your quickest route to recovery. In the end, this ended up being the single most helpful thing for my recovery. When you‚Äôre knowledgeable of exactly what is at your disposal, you can try everything and see what works best for you. In fact, I found really helpful ideas in books that none of my therapists had even heard of. Like your anxiety, the list of books that will be the most helpful for you is very personalized, but here are my recommendations (all of these books are available on Audible, which is how I consumed them): * The DARE Response. Phenomenal book written by someone who‚Äôs been through the worst parts of anxiety and paved his own path to recovery. His techniques are a combination between ACT and a little CBT. I would especially recommend this book if you‚Äôre at the higher end of the anxiety scale. * Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy. This book is considered the gold standard of CBT. It‚Äôs aimed at treating depression, but (as the author notes) it works for anxiety as well. I listened to the whole thing, then picked out the chapters I thought applied to me. It‚Äôs long, so I don‚Äôt think you need to do the first part, but there‚Äôs a lot of valuable information in this book that a lot of other books skim over. * Rewire Your Anxious Brain. This one is 1/4 CBT, 1/4 lifestyle guidance, and half about the neuroscience behind anxiety. I like this one a lot because it gets into some of the mechanics of why we feel the way we do, and why therapy and lifestyle changes are so impactful. * The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck. This one has been mentioned on this subreddit several times before, and I really like it. It serves as a great reminder of why some things in life just aren‚Äôt worth giving a fuck about. Fair warning: Mark Manson describes OCD as ‚Äúan incurable disease‚Äù in this book. He‚Äôs not a doctor or therapist and isn‚Äôt really knowledgeable on the subject, so I‚Äôd take that section with a grain of salt. But the message he drives home at the end is really good regardless. Remember, the point of these books isn‚Äôt to give you step by step instructions on how to get better. Rather they are there to give you ideas on how to best help yourself. **2.** Get into therapy. This is perhaps the second most important things you can do for yourself behind reading. Therapy is the first line of treatment for anxiety, and for good reason. Once you find a therapist who you work well with, you‚Äôll notice you progress much more quickly. Some things to look out for when you screen your therapist: * Are they nice? Kind of an obvious one but worth going over. Do you feel like they take what you‚Äôre saying seriously? Are their answers usually thoughtful and caring? * Are they experienced? My first therapist was tremendously nice and caring, but he didn‚Äôt know much about anxiety treatment beyond the very basics, like square breathing. * Are they accessible? Or do you have to drive two hours to see them? Are they available for weekly sessions or can you only see them once a month? It may take a while until you find a therapist who‚Äôs right for you, but this is a person you‚Äôll be meeting with multiple times a month for several months/years. I would advise giving your therapist at least three or four sessions before you consider switching to a new one. **3.** Continue with all the acceptance techniques outlined in the previous section. These are things that I remind myself of even now. The more open you are towards your anxiety symptoms, the more quickly they‚Äôll dissipate. In addition, if you can, start easing off your benzo a little bit. If you‚Äôre taking it three times a day, try to move down to two. If you‚Äôre down to two a day, try one. **4.** Start making some lifestyle changes that are proven to help with anxiety in the long term: * Cardiovascular exercise. It‚Äôs said that exercise is one of the most positive things to improve mood when you‚Äôre anxious, but I‚Äôd like to look at it from the opposite perspective. When you‚Äôre anxious, your body is filled with excess adrenaline that keeps building up. If you don‚Äôt dump it out somehow, the symptoms will inevitably get worse. So getting up from your desk or your bed is one of the most effective things you can do to help yourself in the long term. If you‚Äôre not super exercise savvy, my suggestion is to get out and walk, jogging occasionally. Walking is great for releasing excess energy, but you can boost the speed at which you let off adrenaline by running. You don‚Äôt need to do sprints whenever you run, but you‚Äôll get the most out of your exercise if you really challenge yourself each time. More on this later. * Meditation. The reason so many people say this is so good for anxiety is because it helps you better come to terms with your symptoms. It also lets you really hone in on some of the less productive thought processes you‚Äôre having so you can learn to catch and correct them. Keep in mind, the purpose of meditation is not to clear your mind and think of nothing. In fact, it‚Äôs almost the opposite. While meditating, your job is to let your body and brain work as normal and merely try to act as a conscious observer of all your thoughts and feelings. A really popular visualization technique for this is thinking of your thoughts as clouds, and you‚Äôre just watching them pass by. There is plenty of information out there on how to meditate, and it includes helpful techniques like noting, so I won‚Äôt go into it that much here. Make sure that your approach to meditation is similar to your approach to exercise: slowly ease into it by doing it for short periods at first, then working up very gradually to longer periods after every couple sessions. I suggest trying out the meditation app Calm. * Diet. If you‚Äôre reading this, you‚Äôve probably read the do‚Äôs and don‚Äôts of your diet about a hundred times, but I‚Äôll reiterate quickly here: no caffeine, no alcohol. Try your best to avoid excessive sweets and fried foods, and those are shown [1] to worsen your mood in the long term. One of the less known changes you can make to your diet is to include more natural sources of magnesium. It is speculated [2] that magnesium plays a part in anxiety regulation, though the research isn‚Äôt entirely there yet. Regardless, try to include dark leafy greens like spinach and whole grains like brown rice into your diet to hit this as a staple. You can also take a magnesium supplement (I‚Äôll defer to the DARE Response for information about it), though again, research is shaky so this alone won‚Äôt bring change. * Medication. This one will be completely at you/your doctor‚Äôs discretion. Some people respond well to antidepressants, some don‚Äôt. I didn‚Äôt feel like they helped me all that much, but you might. Note, the purpose of antidepressants isn‚Äôt to make you happy or to gradually cure your anxiety. Research shows [3] that antidepressants are useful for supplementing long term change in the brain. This is a REALLY important thing to note because it means that antidepressants won‚Äôt change anything on their own. Only if you give conscious effort will you be able to see positive change. Medication only makes it happen more quickly. **5.** Give it time. Your nervous system doesn‚Äôt change overnight. It may need a week or two more before you achieve the results you want. So just keep practicing your therapy techniques and doing everything you know works and push through. Once you‚Äôve been at these things for a while, you‚Äôll notice your anxiety start to decrease to the next phase. Hovering around 4 - 6: If you‚Äôre at this stage, congratulations! The first two stages are really hard to break out of, and if you did, it likely took a tremendous amount of effort. So give yourself a pat on the back. Once you‚Äôve reached this stage, your anxiety likely doesn‚Äôt manifest itself physically as much. You may still get nauseated occasionally, but most of the time you‚Äôre able to eat and drink and (hopefully) sleep through the night. You‚Äôve started reclaiming your normal life. You get out of the house relatively frequently and do things like run errands. But you‚Äôre still really anxious whenever you go out. In addition, though your physical symptoms may have eased up, your mental symptoms may still be incredibly difficult to deal with. So here‚Äôs what you should do at this stage: **1.** Keep staying the course. It‚Äôs easy to flounder or stop, and it‚Äôs okay if you do. But remember to pick up right where you left off. Also, don‚Äôt beat yourself up for making mistakes. Everyone falters from time to time, it‚Äôs part of what makes us human. And it‚Äôs okay if things are taking longer than you expected. Take it from me that if you keep looking for ways you can improve your anxiety and practicing the techniques you know work, things will get better. **2.** Keep pushing the envelope. Identify areas of your life that you‚Äôve always been anxious about and challenge yourself to use therapy techniques to improve them. I used to beat myself up for being awkward ever since I was a little kid. I‚Äôd find flaws in every interaction I had with others and nitpick every little thing. Once I started working on this, I noticed not only an improvement in these kinds of situations, but also an improvement in my overall anxiety. This is part of how Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) therapy works. You expose yourself to situations that make your anxiety flare up, and use CBT techniques to curb your conscious worry. An important note about this is **these experiences aren‚Äôt meant to be fun**. If you‚Äôve got social anxiety and you‚Äôre challenging yourself by going to meet new people, it‚Äôll likely be an uncomfortable experience the first few times. People around you may be having plenty of fun while you keep worrying and criticizing yourself. But you‚Äôll slowly notice improvement, and with time, it‚Äôll become more and more natural over time. **3.** Along the same lines, start making your workouts more difficult. Run/bike/swim for longer, lift heavier weights. When you‚Äôre anxious, you tend to stagnate in certain areas of your life, sometimes without realizing it. The only way to get better is to keep pushing the bounds of what you do. I saw a post on this subreddit a while ago along the lines of ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been lightly jogging for 25 minutes a day for the last month or two, why aren‚Äôt I seeing my anxiety improve?‚Äù And the answer in this case is because this person wasn‚Äôt pushing him/herself. If you continue to do the same things, you shouldn‚Äôt expect to see improvement. **4.** Start identifying and cutting off some of your crutches/unhealthy habits. For a lot of us (me included), this comes in the form of googling symptoms or constantly asking for help on this subreddit. It‚Äôs okay to cave every once in a while at this stage, but you need to consciously stop yourself from constantly asking for help on the internet. One of the things this does is keep you focused on your anxiety, which is exactly what engaging yourself is meant to prevent. I stopped browsing this subreddit for almost a half year, and my condition got much better as a result. If you‚Äôre seriously concerned about something, visit your doctor/psychiatrist/therapist and ask them, but once they diagnose you, do not second guess it. I spent my entire college career going to different doctors (I think at least 10 or 11 different types, sometimes multiple doctors of each kind). I was convinced there was something wrong with me that no one could find, but the true culprit was anxiety. If you **feel** like you‚Äôre constantly sick or dying, yet doctors can‚Äôt find anything wrong, this is a clue that you have an issue with being a hypochondriac. You can go about fixing this the way you did in all areas of your therapy (I personally used the CBT method outlined in Feeling Good), but the important thing is to recognize that just because your brain is telling you something doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs true. **5.** Give it time. I‚Äôve said it before but it‚Äôs important to reiterate. Recovering from this stage might take several months, so try your best to be patient. And remember, if things aren‚Äôt the way you want them to be now, they will be soon. I think it‚Äôs also important to discuss the idea of **cognitive fusion**, which you may have come across in your book reading, as I think understanding it will be really helpful. Google defines cognitive fusion as attaching a thought to an experience, but since that‚Äôs kind of vague, I‚Äôll give my own definition. Cognitive fusion is when you take what your thoughts tell you as fact. In other words, you‚Äôre using your thoughts to draw irrational conclusions about the world around you. One example of this is if you‚Äôre someone who criticizes themselves too much. You might tell yourself ‚Äúthat conversation was so awkward, so that person must think I‚Äôm a loser.‚Äù In this case, whether or not the situation was awkward, you don‚Äôt know what the other person is thinking. I used to think this a lot until I realized people really didn‚Äôt see me that way, and all the worrying I did was for nothing. A healthy level of questioning can do lots to help you overcome your anxiety. At this stage, I had the most trouble with mental symptoms, namely the feeling of going crazy. I thought the little floaters in my eyes were hallucinations, I always second guessed my own sanity, I thought the weird dreams or intrusive thoughts I was having were a sign of schizophrenia, and anytime I was happy, I thought it was a sign of bipolar disorder. This is another great example of cognitive fusion that took me a while to get over: I thought I was going crazy, so to me that was evidence that I really was. If you think this describes you, it might do you well to get into the habit of questioning your thoughts as well. Is it more logical that your psychiatrist, therapists, family, and friends are correct when they say you‚Äôre not crazy and are just experiencing symptoms of anxiety, or that you‚Äôre the one person out of the fifty who‚Äôs somehow figured out you‚Äôre losing it? This applies to basically every anxious situation you may encounter. Remember: **just because you think something doesn‚Äôt make it true**. One of the things that took me a long time to realize was that my constant worry over these things was caused by the fact that I was paying so much attention to them. At this point in recovery, it‚Äôs absolutely **imperative that you keep yourself occupied, especially when you‚Äôre most anxious**. I found that doing things like cooking and cleaning were ways to keep my mind off my anxiety without having to think about it. I suggest doing the same, as they‚Äôre both productive and beneficial in the end. Eventually, your mind will calm down on its own and you‚Äôll find your own solutions to these symptoms. I find that at this point the really important thing really is time. Once I felt like I was going crazy for the hundredth time, I realized that if every time before this one was a false alarm, this one (and all the ones after for that matter) are false alarms too. This stage took about 3 months to recover from, but once I did, I hit the next stage. Anxiety is 1 - 3 most days, with some days feeling almost completely anxiety free: You‚Äôre in the home stretch. This is it. You‚Äôre likely already giving yourself credit for all the hard work you‚Äôve done, but you should still take a moment to recognize just how far you‚Äôve come. For me, having a day where I go out and try something new with friends while anxious is something I wouldn't have been able to do even BEFORE my anxiety disorder. Certainly not anything I‚Äôd ever dreamed of while in the thick of it. Seriously, if you‚Äôve hit this point, the light should be at the end of the tunnel. And on the days where it‚Äôs a little harder to deal with, let me reassure you: you‚Äôre almost home free. Note: your symptoms will still be present at this point. Some of the intrusive thoughts might still come, sometimes you‚Äôll have a bit of dissociation or an occasional almost-panic attack, but you know how to deal with these things. Your moments of panic don‚Äôt last more than a few seconds, and your symptoms don‚Äôt really illicit a response from you. At this stage: **1.** You know what works best for you. Keep doing it. You have your techniques and you‚Äôve clearly demonstrated they work. All that‚Äôs left is to keep doing them and reap the rewards you know will come. On the worse days when your anxiety peaks at a 3 or 4, remind yourself where you were several months ago and how you‚Äôll never experience anxiety that bad ever again. Then gently engage yourself in something and ride the wave of anxiety until it subsides. **2.** Slowly lose your crutches. If you discuss your anxiety with your friends, stop doing so as frequently and eventually stop altogether. If you‚Äôre still occasionally taking benzos, slowly taper off. The more of your independence you get back, the more confident you‚Äôll feel. **3.** Keep exploring other areas of your life where you‚Äôve had anxiety and use what you‚Äôve learned to stop worrying. For me, this meant things like conquering my fear of heights by going snowboarding, and confronting my discomfort with physical and emotional intimacy by going out of my way to discuss these things. The more of these long-standing anxieties you‚Äôre able to ease, the better you‚Äôll feel overall. Plus you get the added sense of achievement for doing things that past you would‚Äôve never been able to do. There really isn‚Äôt much left to say at this stage. I found myself being discouraged more frequently at this point just because I knew I was so close to the finish line but not quite there. In case you need any encouragement, remind yourself of how well you‚Äôve done so far and that there‚Äôs more to come. Then finally‚Ä¶ No anxiety, with the worst days peaking at a 0.5 or 1: That‚Äôs it. All the voices in your head telling you you‚Äôre not good enough have gone silent. All those symptoms you used to worry so much about don‚Äôt really happen anymore. You might still be a bit fatigued or foggy some days, but most of the time you‚Äôre energetic, present, and can confront new challenges with a sense of confidence you‚Äôve never had. It‚Äôs been a few months since you‚Äôve even given your anxiety a second thought. You know some of your symptoms might come back for a short spell every once in a while, but you‚Äôre not worried about them. You know exactly what to do when that happens, and that they‚Äôll go away just as quickly as they came. I don‚Äôt have any advice for this point. You know what got you here and have built up the mental fortitude to know you‚Äôll keep on doing it. Congratulations. You understand how amazing it is that you got to this point. Remember this feeling. _ My therapist once gave me a great rule of thumb I think sums things up really well: whatever your anxiety is telling you to do, do the opposite. If it‚Äôs telling you not to get out of bed, do it. If it‚Äôs telling you not to go to a social event, do that. If it‚Äôs telling you you‚Äôre going to suffer from some grave illness, remind yourself that‚Äôs not true. If it‚Äôs telling you to google your symptoms or ask for help, don‚Äôt. If it‚Äôs telling you you‚Äôre losing your mind, remind yourself you‚Äôre not. Give it enough time, and eventually things will get better. **Summary:** **Ease into your symptoms. Remember that it‚Äôs just anxiety and can‚Äôt do anything other than make you uncomfortable. You‚Äôve been through this a hundred times before and survived every single time.** **Don‚Äôt fight it. When you fight your anxiety, it only gets worse. So let your anxiety do whatever it wants and just watch as a detached observer.** **Keep yourself occupied. The more time you spend thinking about your anxiety, googling your symptoms, posting on this subreddit, writing in your journal, or just stewing in general, the worse off you‚Äôll be. Cook, clean, dance, exercise, paint, draw, do anything you can to forcibly rip your mind off your anxiety.** **Keep pushing the bounds of what you‚Äôre doing. Expose yourself to more anxiety. Exercise harder. Try things you‚Äôve never tried before. Make your anxiety flare up as much as possible because you know it‚Äôll only benefit you in the end.** **Regularly question your thoughts. Just because you think something doesn‚Äôt make it true. You‚Äôll find a hundred times out of a hundred the thing you‚Äôve been dreading isn‚Äôt half as horrible as your brain has made it out to be.** **Give it time. You‚Äôll find once you experience the same anxiety for the same reason for the thousandth time in a row that it becomes a bit easier to stop believing what it tells you.** Thank you for reading this. I really hope that, no matter where you‚Äôre at in life, you gained something from this. Please let me know what parts of this were the most helpful, or if there‚Äôs anything you want me to expand upon. I‚Äôll try to respond to comments as best I can, but I work full time and don‚Äôt log into this account all that much, so I‚Äôm sorry if I don‚Äôt get to your comment as quickly as you‚Äôd like. Sources: 1. 2. 3. Listed in Rewire Your Anxious Brain. Sorry I don‚Äôt have the citation offhand. Books: Edit: Sorry if the formatting is a little funky. Edit 2: Thank you guys for the overwhelmingly positive response! I've read all of your comments and am super happy ya'll found this helpful. I want to remind all of you who are currently going through bouts of anxiety that you absolutely will make it through and that you'll be a much better person for it. Keep in mind: anxiety does not define you. An anxiety disorder is not a permanent condition. Much like any other illness or disorder, you can take gradual steps to recover. It may not come as quickly as you want and you will encounter plenty of pitfalls. But once you start counting your victories, however small, you'll realize what a **huge** difference your efforts can make. Good luck guys :) Edit 3: Tossed another David Burns book (author of Feeling Good), **When Panic Attacks**, up in the book list. Thanks u/PM10inPAYPAL4LULZ. Also fixed some formatting issues. Edit 4: Thanks again for all the support everyone. I'm glad people are still managing to find this post even though it was written almost a half year ago. I tossed a book recommended by u/andrelolzi up on the list in case anyone is looking for more resources."

However, for some reason e-correspondence really gets me. Especially talking to people who are very pushy and demanding for quick replies. I don‚Äôt always feel like answering at the moment so I‚Äôll put it off, but then I get very anxious knowing the reply is waiting for me, and I ignore it, and it makes me more anxious thinking the person is getting angry at me, and it‚Äôs a very vicious cycle. The only time I don‚Äôt feel this way is when I‚Äôm either very busy working (and then I use the messages as a welcome distraction) or when I take Adderall for ADHD, because then I feel very assertive and have no fear. I think the lock down has made things worse because now I don‚Äôt go to the gym (usual fear release) and there‚Äôs no social time to replenish my mind in preparation for online messages, since they take a lot of mental effort. I‚Äôm curious to see if anyone else experiences this, and hopefully I won‚Äôt avoid your replies üòÜ ========= Edit: Lmao this post blew up, and now I have 40+ replies to read. The irony is astounding! But I am to hear everyone else‚Äôs experiences too. I was thinking more and part of it may be due to the fact that each online message represents another demand on our time and another decision we must make. At least that‚Äôs part of the issue. And diverts from our energy when already in an inert place. Take care of yourselves, everyone >< Gonna go take a relaxing bath after reading the replies here"

    "text": "People don't want to admit this but Anxietys root cause is because of the people you were raised with Yes we can say \"oh stop blaming your parents\" but the truth is, the reason why most are struggling with anxiety is because you had guardians who didn't do a good job of making you confident about yourself. Yes you can say its \"genetics\" but even then, nurture can either make the condition better or worse. You are raised with these people your whole life, the people that surround you growing up effect you whether you like to admit it or not. Maybe your anxious all the time because your parents would throw temper tantrums every time you made mistakes and that manifested later on in to your adulthood, maybe your anxious because you had Authoritarian parents that didn't allow you to grow socially, maybe you are genetically prone to being more anxious and the people you were raised with only enhanced that feeling etc. All I'm saying is, it's so underrated how much parents can affect there children growing up. It can make life alot more difficult than it should be if your not raised with the right people. To adults who are going through anxiety, yes its tougher for us but take it one step at a time. Don't compare yourself to others because they didn't live your life. They didn't face the troubles that you did, every small step you take is progress. I have a toxic family who doesn't see any of my small achievements but to me it's big. The past affects your present but it's about how you deal with it that matters. One step at a time and soon you'll be able to overcome it."

Even though you are scared, you are safe. Even though you are scared, you are loved. I love you. I don‚Äôt know you, but if people can hate indiscriminately, I can love indiscriminately. I love you. There is love all around you in little, gentle ways. When someone smiles at you, they are sharing a small bit of love. When someone lets you pass in traffic or lets you merge, they are offering you a tiny bit of love. Every ‚Äúplease‚Äù and ‚Äúthank you‚Äù is love. Even when something is someone‚Äôs job - such as a store clerk wishing you a good day, or the coffee shop person chatting you up per corporate policy. They are still extending love. Accept the little moments of love. Accept the little moments of safety, too. Right now, in this moment in time, you are safe. It is okay to be afraid. I still love you. Do you love you? You must. Hold yourself, please. Do it for me. Put your arms around yourself. Pet your face gently. Tell yourself, ‚ÄúI love you. You are safe. It is okay to be afraid. There is nothing wrong with you. You are human and you are feeling afraid and I am here with you.‚Äù Do not treat yourself with contempt and do not abandon yourself for being afraid. You deserve unconditional love. Stay with yourself and be kind to yourself even though you are struggling. Tell yourself, ‚ÄúI will not abandon you. I will not judge you. I will not reject you just because you are afraid.‚Äù Keep your promise to yourself. Tell yourself ‚ÄúI love you, sweetheart.‚Äù When you are ready, share a small bit of love with others. Smile to them. Say please and thank you. Wish them well. Be kind. Let them merge in traffic. Do it without expectation for something in return. Pick up a piece of trash because you love the park. Say, ‚ÄúI love you park. Let me help you feel nice. It‚Äôs okay. I got this.‚Äù (Even if you just say it in your head). Radiate love and safety. Receive love and safety. I love you. Pass it on."

All samples have failed to result in incubation of live virus. Experts believe the negative result of incubation experiments with the saliva and throat swab sample point at either minuscule viral load, or non-viable viral fragments unable to cause infection. Furthermore, samples from toothbrush, drinking cups, masks, towels and other personal effects have been taken from the 300 asymptomatic carriers, all have tested negative. On top of this, 1174 close contacts of the 300 asymptomatic carriers identified have all tested negative on PCR tests.

    "text": "I absolutely hate being a high-functioning person with generalized & social anxiety disorder. I go through my day and no one knows how much effort it takes me to fake socializing, to fake talking to people, most people just assume I'm a bitch at first until they get to know me because I don't speak up very much but when I do, I sound confident.. but only because I FORCE myself to. I get most things done on my checklist. I workout, I eat healthy, I have a degree, I'm in a relationship, I pay my bills, I seem like I have my shit together. But I don't. I spend most of my time over-analzying things I've said, walking around faking everything all day, worried I can't trust anyone around me and over-analzying my relationship, calling myself a loser, telling myself I'm not good enough, having PTSD flashbacks from an abusive childhood. And it's wild that no one has any idea. And I'll never let them know. Because I'm embarrassed. So if you see someone who seems like they have their shit together or you're jealous, or you think they just don't talk to you a lot because they don't like you.. maybe consider that they are high-functioning. I think we tend to forget that depression & anxiety don't only present as not being able to get out of bed or do anything."

    "text": "I had a panic attack while driving, pulled over off the road to stay safe, and someone hit me at full speed while texting and driving. My car was totaled. I've been diagnosed with GAD and have had a few pretty bad panic attacks in my life. Last night I was driving from my old apartment to my first house I just bought with the last load of my house plants (I had about 35 in the car, it's a hobby of mine). For some reason I'm still unsure of, I started having a panic attack. My heart rate went up, the pit of my stomach dropped, I felt woozy, broke out in cold sweat, and felt extremely anxious. Right before going onto the highway, I pulled to the side off the road with my hazards on to give myself time to come down off of this panic attack. I called my partner, who was at the house, and told him I was having a panic attack and he worked with me to help me get grounded and calm. I ended the call after about 8 minutes and told him I would call him back when I felt good to drive again. The intensity of the attack was coming in waves at this point, but it was gradually lessening. Less than 2 minutes after the call ended, someone rammed full speed into the back of my car. My car was lurched forward with an awful crunch, plant dirt and debris flew every where, I was thrown forward but my seat belt caught me. I was OFF the road to the side with my hazards on, this guy had to have somehow swerved and not seen my car to have hit me. I had no immediate injuries, but I was terrified. I've never heard myself scream like that. The panic attack I had almost gotten under control was now replaced with absolute mayhem of fear and pure adrenaline. The guy came out of his car and approached mine, I was already on the phone with police. He kept trying to give me his license and saying he was going to give me his insurance info. I was sobbing and telling him to wait I'm on the phone with the police. He handed me his license, so I took a picture of it while trying to describe to the location to the 911 operator. He took his license and drove off without getting his insurance. He spoke not great English and I think he was terrified and didn't know what to do. The police came with an ambulance. They took my vitals. I had no pain in my neck, back, stomach, or any where. I told the police what happened and showed them the pic of this guy's license. They were like \"WTF this guy gave you his license but not his insurance and drove off?\" That is a hit and run felony. I think the guy was trying to do the right thing but got scared and fled. The police caught him in about 30 mins. Turns out a car with a lot of front damage can't get very far. My car was totaled, the back wheel was completely torn off and the back axel was twisted beyond repair. Many of my house plant's pots had shattered immediately. I had to leave half of them in the car as it got taken to an impound lot because there wasn't enough room in my friend's car who came and picked me up. I loved this car so much, it saved my fucking life. I was beside myself seeing it being towed away, broken beyond repair, with some of my beautiful house plants still in it. I am fully covered for by insurance so they will be paying me out for the value of my car. I will be able to go to the impound lot to get the remainder of my plants and belongings. What just strikes me as so fucking cruel was that I had a panic attack and chose to safely move off the road to not put myself or other drivers in danger, and I still got hit and my car was totaled. I'm so grateful to still be alive and not in tjr hospital. But I'm scared about what this means for me and my anxiety moving forward. Will I have PTSD from this? Will I be scared of driving/cars moving forward?"

    "text": "Today I had a job interview and I managed to go. No one seems to understand that for some people it's a tremendous struggle. I have really bad IBS with panic-/anxiety disorder and those two combined make it extremely difficult to travel. I don't have a car so I have to use the public transport. 90% of the time when I leave the house I get the runs. Like really bad. Almost always I have to turn back, take a shit and try again. Sometimes it doesn't work and I can't go. Not even to the grocery store for example. I've used meds (benzos) for it for a while which usually work, but whenever I try to seek help the nr1 concern is \" well you gotta get rid of those pills \". I don't care a flying fuck if I'm injecting heroine if I manage to go to work, leave the house, do normal stuff. Not even 1% of people can fathom the struggle some people have to just go buy groceries. I've tried to seek help with this but every single time **only** thing I hear is \" stop using meds \". I've used benzos 3 times in past 3 weeks. I'm improving, no one cares. I'm working on my diet and excercise, no one cares. All I hear is \" stop using meds, stop using meds \". From medical professionals, family and friends. True, meds might make it so that without them normal things become more difficult. But my goal for now is to travel to work. Any means necessary. Okay I stop meds then what ? No one gives me the step 2. I've been unemployed for 6 months and my nr1 goal is to get a job, manage to get there and do well. Thanks for the rant. Peace. Edit/update: Had a dr's appointment today. I told her several times that my only goal is to travel to work. I said very clearly that I still need help, but I didn't care if it was in a form of benzo's, other meds or therapy. As a result she prescribed more benzo's. And psyllium seeds. Also according to her, stomach problems and panic disorder are completely unrelated and have nothing to do with eachother... sigh."

It‚Äôs incredibly challenging and hurts my heart. For Christmas, he said I get a hug. I could see him taking deep breaths (subtly) and preparing himself. I asked how long I could hug him and he said as long as I wanted. When I hugged him, I asked him if I could give him a kiss, too, and he said yes, so I kissed his head. It filled my heart with so much warmth and peace and happiness and I can still feel it a couple hours later. I truly understand anxiety and I know just how difficult this was for him. It was the most selfless and loving and special gift I could have gotten. Also, as a side note, my older son got me an extra gift for my stocking because I‚Äôm divorced and this is my first Christmas as a single woman. (I invited their father over last year to help them with the transition, but not this year). My son wanted to be sure I had something in my stocking since my ex always did that for me.

While I was playing in the garden I fell over and injured my hand. My knuckle was bleeding quite a lot and I still have a scar from the injury to this day. Crying, I ran inside to my mother. After treating my wound, she spanked me as punishment for my mistake. If my mother had decided to give me comfort and reassurance in these kinds of situations, maybe in my adulthood, when I made a mistake, my natural response would be to try to soothe myself and calm down. Instead, when I make a mistake, my natural response is to feel anxiety or panic, and it's really difficult for me to calm down. I'm hoping that this realisation will be the first step towards me being able to overwrite my childhood conditioning and learn how to treat myself with acceptance and understanding."

I've been dealing with anxiety for years, but I've always managed to keep it under wraps at work. Yesterday, during a team meeting, I felt it building up the rapid heartbeat, the dizziness, the overwhelming urge to flee. Before I knew it, I was hyperventilating in front of everyone. I was mortified. I thought, \"Great, now everyone knows I'm a mess.\" But then something unexpected happened. My boss calmly ended the meeting and sat down next to me. She didn't bombard me with questions or make a scene. She just said, \"It's okay. Let's take a walk.\" We went outside, and she shared that her sister also struggles with anxiety. She told me to take the rest of the day off and offered resources our company provides for mental health. I always thought showing vulnerability at work was a weakness, but her kindness showed me otherwise. If you're struggling, please know that there are people who will understand."

And then you‚Äôre thinking about Australia and the fires, or the flu going around, or how your stomach has been in knots today and you didn‚Äôt eat dinner and now taking a shower seems impossible because there‚Äôs so much happening and you need to know what‚Äôs going to happen next. I want you to know you‚Äôre not alone, no matter what happens. I may not know you, but I am right there with you, and we can share this together. No matter what happens. Sending you all so many hugs. --- Dear everyone, I am writing to let you know I am reading each and every single one of your comments. I made this post because I saw many posts talking about how scared folks are. Truth be told, I am scared too. I'm scared everyday. That's life with anxiety. Sometimes it is really small and it feels like I can just \"ignore\" it and put it in my back pocket, and sometimes it is really huge and like a gigantic elephant stomping around in my brain. I recognize the tendency in myself to get caught up in negative feedback loops (including obsessively reading about horrible things and obsessing over current events) and decided I would post something somewhat different for us because sometimes, just being honest, coming to /r/anxiety can leave me feeling a bit more anxious, lol. Whatever the case, I want to thank you all once again for taking the time to share your thoughts and feelings. It is good to know we're not alone. There are so many of us out there who want to see good things come out in the world. I want to share a passage that is comforting to me when things become difficult, and hope maybe it will be of some small comfort to y'all as well. >\"The life of Man is a long march through the night, surrounded by invisible foes, tortured by weariness and pain, towards a goal that few can hope to reach, and where none may tarry long. One by one, as they march, our comrades vanish from our sight, seized by the silent orders of omnipotent Death. Very brief is the time in which we can help them, in which their happiness or misery is decided. Be it ours to shed sunshine on their path, to lighten their sorrows by the balm of sympathy, to give them the pure joy of a never-tiring affection, to strengthen failing courage, to instil faith in hours of despair. Let us not weigh in grudging scales their merits and demerits, but let us think only of their need--of the sorrows, the difficulties, perhaps the blindnesses, that make the misery of their lives; let us remember that they are fellow-sufferers in the same darkness, actors in the same tragedy as ourselves. And so, when their day is over, when their good and their evil have become eternal by the immortality of the past, be it ours to feel that, where they suffered, where they failed, no deed of ours was the cause; but wherever a spark of the divine fire kindled in their hearts, we were ready with encouragement, with sympathy, with brave words in which high courage glowed.\" - Bertrand Russell, A Free Man's Worship"

Thinking, Planning, problem solving, and of course, worrying. Then worrying some more. I'm never in the current moment, my mind is always in the future. Before I know it, the day is over, and I have barely acknowledged/talked to anybody and barely looked anyone in the eye. I'm not miserable, I just need to get out of of my head, stop worrying with my mind jumping from one thing to the next, stop getting frustrated and irritated, stop overthinking everything, and instead actually live life and enjoy it."

    "text": "Weird but Surprisingly Effective Ways to Reduce Anxiety Hey everyone, I've been exploring unusual ways to deal with anxiety, and I thought I'd share a list of weird strategies that have worked for me. Like probably everyone else here I have tried a ton of different traditional methods to relieve anxiety such as breathing exercises, meditation, journaling, therapy, working out etc and while those are amazing methods that work for some, sometimes nothing seems to help in the moment. So I started experimenting and came up with some unconventional tricks (and some I‚Äôve picked up from others) that work surprisingly well for me! I have separated methods into different categories so you can browse each category depending on what works for you! **Body Oriented:** * **Turn Your Room Cold** \\- Turn the heat down or open a window. A colder space can sometimes help your body calm down. * **Chug a Bottle of Water** \\- It‚Äôs refreshing and forces you to pause for a second. Bonus: dehydration can make anxiety worse, so this helps on two levels. * **Lay on Your Other Side (Away From Your Heart)** \\- If you‚Äôre lying on your left side and can feel your heartbeat too strongly, flip over. It can stop you from hyper-focusing on it. * **Dunk Your Face in Ice Water/Take a Cold Shower** \\- This one feels extreme but it really works. It triggers your \"dive reflex,\" which slows your heart rate and calms your nervous system. * **Hold Ice Cubes or Something Cold** \\- The cold sensation brings you back into your body and out of your head. * **Sit on the Floor** \\- Just plop down wherever you are. Sitting on the ground can make you feel more grounded. **Mind Tricking:** * **Spell Words Backward** \\- Pick a random word (like elephant for example) and spell it in reverse. Keep repeating with different words until you are distracting enough to break the cycle of anxious thoughts. * **Count Things Around You** \\- Look around the room and count how many blue objects you can see or how many things are round. * **Force Yourself to Smile** \\- Even fake smiling can trigger endorphin release and convince your brain you‚Äôre okay. * **Do Some Math** \\- Start at 100 and count backward by 7s. Or do a Times table. **Behavorial:** * **Flip Your Environment Around** \\- Rearrange your furniture, your desk, or even just your pillows. Cleaning up your space can shift your mindset too. * **Play The Floor Is Lava** \\- Lol like the game you played as a kid. Jumping around the room is a great distraction. * **Eat Some Crunchy or Sour Snacks** \\- The texture, taste and sound give your mind something else to focus on. * **Wrap Yourself With Blankets** \\- Weighted blankets are ideal, but even regular ones can work. * **Gratitude** \\- Think about everything you are grateful for. This can help take your mind off of insecurities you are thinking about. **Environmental:** * **Turn on White Noise or Static** \\- The background hum of white noise can calm your brain if silence feels too loud. However, this one sometimes leads to hyperfocusing on intrusive thoughts, dissociation or depersonalization for me, so proceed with caution. * **Dim the Lights or Change the Color** \\- Swap your lighting for something softer or cooler (like blue or green tones). * **Smell Something Really Strong** \\- Smell something like peppermint, citrus, or even vinegar because a strong scent can \"shock\" your senses and pull you out of your anxious headspace. **Interactive:** * **Carry Something Heavy** \\- Holding something with weight can help ground you. * **Balance on One Leg** \\- It sounds weird, but focusing on balancing can help distract you. * **Scribble** \\- Grab a pen and just scribble as hard and fast as you can. Helps release energy, is super calming, and can help distract you * **Stare at Something Moving** \\- Watch a fan, a candle flame, bobblehead, the snow falling outside, etc. It gives your mind something repetitive and calming to focus on. However, this one also sometimes leads to hyperfocusing on intrusive thoughts, dissociation or depersonalization for me, so again, proceed with caution. Some of these sound ridiculous, but they‚Äôve actually helped me, and I hope they can help you too!!!"

    "text": "My therapist gave me some information that was a game changer. It was another day at therapy. Going thru the motions and questions, feeling like I was making now progress and pretty much wasting my time down a dead end road. I was telling her how much I hate to pick up phone calls, hate doctors appointments, hate social gatherings, etc. She asked me why I hated them. And for me, it‚Äôs just plain uncomfortable. My mind goes to: who‚Äôs thinking this about me? why is this person calling me? Why do I have to do more bloodwork? If I don‚Äôt put myself in those situations, I don‚Äôt have to worry about all those things. She says, that‚Äôs good! You‚Äôre beginning to see the root problem is discomfort. Comfort is something we naturally seek. It‚Äôs built in our DNA. BUT! Comfort all the time has a price. Just like too much of anything; coffee, sugar, working out, alcohol. You‚Äôve trained your mind to view discomfort as an enemy. The feeling of discomfort isn‚Äôt necessarily a bad thing. In some cases it can be, but in some cases it‚Äôs the process of growth. It‚Äôs like growing pains. Sure you feel achey but your body is in the process of moving to something better. It‚Äôs completely fine to feel discomfort when you start to actually pick up the phone, actually go out and get an oil change, or putting yourself out there to your friends. But the more you do it, the more you‚Äôll realize you can do. And the less it will be in the form of discomfort. Give yourself room to fail sometimes but by all means continue forward. It took me a few weeks to think about and process this information until I decided to be brave enough to try. And I have to say, I‚Äôm glad I did. Just like she said, I began to see I COULD. And it‚Äôs been a game changer. Hope this helps someone else!"

I would have seizure like activity and the doctors thought I was having seizures when I was coming in or I had a brain bleed. It was horrible. But recently I‚Äôve started working out. I walk for an hour at about 3.5 MPH (brisk pace) and lift weights for about 30/40 mins. Sometimes I‚Äôll skip lifting certain days if I‚Äôm too sore or skip walking if my shins hurt too much and use that day to self care and R.I.C.E. to avoid injury. When I tell you I‚Äôm a different person, I really am. Just after about a week and a half so much has changed. I haven‚Äôt had a panic attack or anxiety for about a week. I became a hypochondriac and would worry about every little thing in my body. I have chronic pain so most bodily sensations are extremely exaggerated because my nerve sensitivity. Even when I have bowel movements they can be uncomfortable for painful when most people don‚Äôt notice them. I‚Äôve really honestly ignored a lot of them. I can go through my day with my pain pretty much fine now. I‚Äôm starting to get some of my natural humor and confidence back. Not much has really changed on the surface, but my mind has healed to what feels like years worth of therapy. I‚Äôm planning on continuing this, and I would recommend you start if you haven‚Äôt been already. Once you start working out you will enjoy it, as long as you ease into it and don‚Äôt overwhelm yourself. You‚Äôll start to enjoy it and make goals. And the future will no longer be littered with fears and anxieties, but hope and motivation towards your goals. Best of luck to all of you! Edit: WOAH! I had no idea this was going to explode! Thank you everyone for the awards and your kind words. I wish everyone luck. I‚Äôm sorry to anyone who said they‚Äôre unable to workout for any reason. I highly suggest trying to contact a specialist (doctor/private trainer/psychologist/therapist etc.) to help you work through any limitations you‚Äôre having. Everyone should have at least one thing they can escape to to help their anxiety. I do still get some anxiety working out but with time it‚Äôs subsiding. What helped the most was easing into it and making sure I was comfortable with my heart rate before trying to push myself. It‚Äôs not perfect but it‚Äôs just enough freedom to allow myself to improve my stamina and strength."

SHe's this girl who works at a local tobacco shop. I kind of knew she probably had a boyfriend and I'd get shut down. She was super polite and it was all good. I imagine it will be ( a little bit ) easier next time I want to do this. I was embarrassed for a few minutes but it passed eventually. Sitting here the next day, I can't believe I did that but I'm proud of myself. Just had to tell someone! Thanks guys. Edit: Just to add what was going through my mind at the time. My psychologist has really been getting me to expose myself to uncomfortable situations especially when you know they're going to be uncomfortable. I kind of figured she had a boyfriend/didn't date customers or whatever but I considered this an experiment in allowing myself to become uncomfortable, and just sitting with that feeling for a while. It's this kind of stuff that almost literally rewires your brain (albeit small amounts over time). If you keep avoiding things, your brain will get used to it and that's how you end up using avoidance to deal with being uncomfortable. If you expose yourself to those uncomfortable situations and allow them to run their course, those feelings start to become a lot less scary over time which can help build confidence. I'm no Psychologist so that was probably a C+ at best explanation but hopefully it makes some sense. Edit 2: Holy Moley the amount of encouragement and props is insane. You all are awesome. Thank you."

Before I start, I want to mention that I have not been diagnosed with anxiety so far, but this is the only community where I feel like I can let this out and ask this question. (Also im new to Reddit and don‚Äôt know how exactly this works, so if I do anything wrong please let me know) So I‚Äôm currently 18 years old and as for my childhood I‚Äôd say it was okay. I was a pretty shy and ‚Äògood‚Äô kid so never got into trouble much. That‚Äôs also why I can‚Äôt recall ever being yelled at or hit. Maybe once, but my parent did apologise and state what they did wasn‚Äôt okay so I don‚Äôt think that would have affected me. However, I get so anxious when I hear anybody yell. It doesn‚Äôt even have to be directed at me. A few examples: one of my teachers has a pretty strong, loud voice. When he suddenly calls out a student‚Äôs name while I‚Äôm doing my homework, I pretty much flinch even though his tone isn‚Äôt even angry. Or a few weeks ago when a classmate wasn‚Äôt wearing a mask, a teacher followed them into our classroom and basically yelled at them for at least a minute. While this was going on, I forced myself to just look down at my notebook and focus on anything but the yelling. Though I tried to distract myself, my eyes were teary and I felt a lump in my throat and I was really tense for the rest of that class. I think that was the most anxious I had felt in years. My sibling who is 12 can be described as a ‚Äòtroublemaker‚Äô I guess. They‚Äôre the opposite of me which can be good at times, but it sometimes gets on my parents‚Äô nerves. They don‚Äôt listen, aren‚Äôt okay with being told ‚Äúno‚Äù and pretty much do what they want when they feel like it. Because of this I often hear my parents being upset at them and I‚Äôve heard my parent yell at them a lot. Sometimes I‚Äôd be in the same room, other times I‚Äôd be in my room and they‚Äôd be downstairs. During these times I‚Äôll also get very tense and just have a horrible feeling. If I‚Äôm in the same room I won‚Äôt even say a word and just get up and leave because it‚Äôs too much. I have no idea what to do with this. I have an intake at a therapist next week for some mental health related issues, should I bring this up too? And does this happen to anyone else? I really don‚Äôt understand why this happens to me Thank you in advance for the help :)"

Like I can't describe it but it's definitely not good. Almost like something is pinching on my organs. And the worst is when I have to wake up in the morning, it's almost like someone has placed added extra weights to my body. I literally can't get up from my bed! I try to force myself up,but I just can't. I just lay there staring at the ceiling, thinking about what I'll do with my day, get anxious about what if I won't be able to be productive today, then getting anxious about how I wasted some time the previous day, then overthinking it all nd wanting to just kill myself. I hate it."

First time posting/visiting the sub, as my anxiety just seems to be getting worse. I‚Äôm a senior in college and the uncertainty that lies ahead of me is unbearable. I‚Äôll go through rough phases where everything, from classes to planning for careers/grad school seems like the most daunting thing, and I just wish to stay in the present. I can‚Äôt see a light, and I feel so trapped inside myself it‚Äôs debilitating. Other days, or periods of time shorter than days, I‚Äôll feel like I have the ability to be and do great. In those few and far in between instances I feel sane, and relatively calm, eager for the future. What I can‚Äôt stand the most is not controlling how i feel, and when I feel it. It‚Äôs so volatile and I can only hope that days in which important tasks take place are days I feel I‚Äôm in control.

I want to say those with anxiety are naturally intelligent people , we tend to be vivid thinkers, over analytical and creative. I've had anxiety disorder about 6 years (it's getting a little better) but I feel like it's messed up my brain. I can't think clear, I don't have interest in things like I used to, i have zero motivation to care and many things are overwhelming. I feel like it's hard for me to comprehend what others are saying and I don't have anything important to say. Hell, I don't even know how to \"act\" around people anymore other than my few close friends and fiance. My brain is always on , it's exhausting. I obsess about the things that bother me, yet too scared to change them. Has anyone experienced this and did you do anything to improve it?

I am here to remind you that you WILL be okay. Don't give up. Your physical symptoms, although they feel very real, are normal and aren't going to hurt you. I PROMISE. I know they are so annoying, but the more you wish them away, the more persistent they become. You deserve to rest. I know everyone expects productivity from you right now, but it's okay to sleep longer than usual, play video games, or eat what you want. Do what you can, not what you think you should be doing. If everything feels like it's going to shit, take a few deep breaths, turn on some rain noises and take a nap. Cut yourself some slack. You are going through a tough time. You are exhausted. You are tired of feeling like crap. It feels like it's never going to end. So give yourself a break. This shit is tough, but so are you. Don't beat yourself up. Three months ago I was genuinely in the worst place in my life. Panic attacks sending me to the ER, dozens of doctors appointments, genuinely convinced I was on the brink of a heart attack. But here I am! Perfectly healthy, and so are you. I pinky promise everything is going to be okay."

My boyfriend told me that I should try to go because this was something I needed to do since I already got paid for the item. Sometimes all you need is some support from one person to tell you that you‚Äôll be fine about a certain situation Once I got back I felt so relieved, it was something so easy to do and I was just overthinking it and making myself more anxious but in reality there was nothing to be anxious about!

Anytime I was feeling down or negative I would just hop in my car and go. The drive took about an hour and it was really peaceful, by the time I got home I was usually in a much better headspace. I just really loved that drive. When explaining the drive to a girl I was really into at the time, she was talking about how it‚Äôs impossible to remember that drive and every turn because there are many. I have driven on those roads enough to remember exactly when to take each turn, I proceeded to go over every turn. about halfway through is when i began to overthink everything. ‚Äúdoes she actually give a shit about this?‚Äù ‚Äúyou look stupid just stop‚Äù the usual.

She shit talks everyone, always points out my flaws, and in general has tried to control my life. This has made me anxious, insecure, and have a low self esteem. I can usually circle back most of my anxiety back to how she has treated me over the years. Some of it came from bullying too of course.

I am now almost 22 and I find myself upset with how my parents raised me.

I am **SO** proud of myself, and I know only people with anxiety will be able to appreciate the strength this took and how much of a victory it is! I have always had a severe needle phobia (avoided HPV vaccine in school, flu shot, refused tetanus and refused all blood tests). It got to a point where I had to get my flu shot up my nose as a spray every year (ridiculous, I know. but the phobia was deeply ingrained into me) I knew I would finally have to face my phobia again with the COVID vaccine. Because I knew if I freaked out and just avoided it, it wouldn't be just me I was endangering. Since the start of the year, the vaccine is all I've been thinking about. I was *dreading* getting that text message to say it was my turn. And then I was having several panic attacks a day leading up to the appointment. It was pretty rough. When the nurse called me in and sat me down, it felt like I was going to pass out or puke or burst into tears... but then I just had this... surreal moment of clarity. I just focused on one of the wall tiles and just... almost tuned out of the situation. And then I felt it go in, and it hurt and I was terrified, but also strangely empowered? Like I couldn't believe I actually got to this exact moment without losing it and running out. I felt dizzy with relief and happiness when it was over, I think the nurse probably thought I was crazy haha. I'm just so damn proud I've faced one of my fears. My arm is pretty sore a day later, but I'm doing just fine! And I think I'll be able to handle it again when I get my 2nd dose!"

Life must be so easy and relaxing... to just live - not constantly battling your mind, not constantly overthinking, not constantly catastrophizing, not constantly evading intrusive thoughts, not constantly having to tell yourself to stop thinking of bad things or the worst unlikely possibilities or past trauma. I wonder how each day must then pass without a huge weight on your shoulders."

As the original post got quite a lot of attraction I'll post an update. Original post: [ &#x200B; Yesterday evening I got a call that they wanted me there today. I said sure, started prepping for the journey ( buses/trains are the most difficult part for me ). I ate all the right foods, slept enough, felt good. I took max dose of meds to \"guarantee\" success. Even with the meds and proper mindset, I was struggling at the second I left the house. Every step felt heavy, I wanted to turn back instantly. I made it to the first train then to the trainstation which had a bathroom. I had 45minutes to gather my thoughts before taking the next train to the destination. I got on the train and things just got worse and worse and worse. Every passing stop I just wanted to jump out, crawl into a ball and cry. 2nd to last stop it became unbearable. I jumped off the train and took the next bus home. Mission failed. I called my employer and was brutally honest about my situation. They seemed very understanding and offered to keep a 0hr contract indefinitely if I get my things together to a stage where I can reliably commute to work. So I made a good first impression and this guy seemed to appreciate honesty instead of me making up some bs lie about \" having some upper respetory symptoms \" or whatever which would've bought me some time. But I like honesty. I don't have to remember any lies and a lot of people appreciate it. Even tho they were very kind and understandable, I feel like absolute shit right now. For past 7months my **only** goal was get a job, go there, do well. Be normal. Today even with medication I couldn't do that. I haven't given up all hope yet and I'll start improving my diet even more and hopefully get to therapy asap. Apparently for people like me, sometimes the therapist meets half way if they know that leaving the house is difficult for the patient. Or even comes to your house. So that's great. This was a major, major setback, but as my dad says \" You do everything you can, and that's all you can do \". I did everything. I prepared for everything. I had everything packed hours before leaving the house. I had a plan for when I get to work. But nope. Anxiety and panic disorder won this battle. Hopefully I'll win the war. And what gives a little extra twist to this: Traveling by car is fine. No problem whatsoever. But if I can't get to work, I can't afford a car. And if I can't take the bus, I can't get to work. Fml."

I don't know if it is just me, but I am horrified by the thought of working all day every day until I can finally afford to retire (if that ever happens). My current job isn't hard, but it sucks the life out of me. Every weekend is too short, and every work week is too long. I never feel like I am rested enough or that I have enough time to do the fun things I like to do. I don't feel like I have hobbies anymore, and I certainly don't have very many friends. I feel like I have to spend all of my \"free time\" keeping my apartment together or resting to try and prepare for the following week. I don't know how people do this for the majority of their lives, and I especially don't know how people manage to do this while also raising children. I think of all the things I want out of life, including children, traveling, homeownership, and everything else that comes with that, and I don't see how it is possible for those things to happen working full time. I don't even make enough money to do those things, much less have the vacation time. I'm working on budgeting and building my savings, but the math never seems to work out in a way that feels comfortable. I promised myself I would see Europe before I hit 25 and I don't think that's a realistic goal anymore. I get stuck in this spiral of \"am I just lazy\" and start to get worried that it is only me. Maybe, somehow, I am the only adult who cannot handle working full time and isn't happy about this being my life for the next 45 years. Sometimes I feel ungrateful. My life is fine - I have a roof over my head and food to eat. I am privileged in terms of the type I work I do. Sure, it is mind numbing and often anxiety-inducing, but it is a job that pays enough for me to stay alive. That's better than a lot of people can say. Can someone tell me it isn't just me? Or maybe give me a reality check that it is? I just don't know how I can keep this up for another 45 years. I'm so tired. Edit: I've taken some time to go through all the comments (though I didn't expect so many) and have really appreciated a lot of the advice i've been given! It's great to feel not as alone in this discomfort, and I think I have some ideas and goals on how to improve my situation in this new year. Thank you all so much."

People taunting me about it and all sorts of troll behavior you get in YouTube comments. A little backstory: I grew up with Trey from the age of 12 until he killed his family when I was 22. I had been in contact and hung out with him up until like 3 months before he did the act. He cut contact with me around then which I‚Äôm pretty sure he either didn‚Äôt want to subject me to that or something. When I say we were best friends, I mean we were BEST friends. I spent the night at his house 3 times a week. We had all night WoW gaming sessions, his mom would cook us lunch and dinner so we didn‚Äôt even have to stop raiding. His family was so good to me, they were basically a second family. I was in his first ever YouTube video, and I continued making shorts and sketches with him, and even helped with a couple of his anime reviews when he specialized his channel. When he moved to his grandparents house in Hempstead, I visited often, and we made it kind of a party house. He filled his cabinets with liquor and he loved playing the host whenever I came back from college to visit. We definitely indulged in pot and prescription meds, but we were young and stupid. I didn‚Äôt do drugs outside of our weekend chill sessions, and I didn‚Äôt realize he had been addicted to those and alcohol. The thing about Trey is he always was pretty secretive. If I ever asked him much about his life or his relationship with his parents, he‚Äôd try to change the subject. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I knew a lot about him, more than his other friends, but it took a lot of work by me to get him to open up. Many a night smoking weed and me opening up about my feelings before he finally did about his dissatisfaction with life, his lack of a higher education, and his fathers disappointment in him. I would always try to cheer him up and make him feel better and it seemed to work. When the murders happened, I didn‚Äôt even know what to do. My girlfriend at the time comforted me, but I was just...numb. I literally didn‚Äôt feel anything. Then, my roommate at the time was like ‚Äúoh let‚Äôs smoke a bowl that‚Äôll cheer you up!‚Äù And that was when I had my first panic attack. I‚Äôm talking full on ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna die oh my god.‚Äù This went on for nearly 2 days. Constantly pacing and checking my heart rate. I couldn‚Äôt sleep or eat and felt like I was going insane. I actually packed up and drove to Dallas (I lived in Austin) to go to my moms because I didn‚Äôt know what to do, and she had a Xanax prescription and gave me one and I slept for nearly 20 hours. I‚Äôve struggled with anxiety for years now. I learned it‚Äôs caused by PTSD from the events. I have no health insurance so I can‚Äôt really go to therapy unless I foot the entire bill so it really sucks, this is my only way to talk about it honestly other than friends who don‚Äôt really understand. No one really understands. My dad thinks I should just get over it, shit happens, but he‚Äôs never had his fucking best friend kill his second family! A family that was honestly nicer than his real family, who treated him with love and respect and not judgement. Anyways, sorry for the erratic writing or if it jumps around a lot. I‚Äôm kind of in a panicked mindset because I got triggered by all the memories of Trey. It‚Äôs hard for me to organize my thoughts when I get into this mindset. It feels like I can‚Äôt focus on any thought and my mind is just swimming and it leaves me confused. If anyone has any questions I‚Äôd love to answer, but I‚Äôd also love some advice and support. Thanks for reading. Edit; Everyone that responded thank you so so much. You have no idea how much this means to me. I‚Äôm in this weird place between joy and guilt that this got so many comments. Joy because I realized people care so much about a random person, and guilt because I feel I don‚Äôt deserve that compassion. Yes I know that‚Äôs stupid but that comes with the anxiety sadly. Like others have said, I feel I may have a bit of survivors guilt because I learned I was actually a target of his, and I read and article by someone yesterday where he did an interview with Texas rangers. Supposedly when he was 13 he was considering killing one of his friends. I know that friend was me. I remember that day because we were playing with guns as country kids will do and I remember him aiming in my general direction but kind of doing a ‚Äúhaha I got you‚Äù thing that he loved doing. Anyways, I‚Äôm trying to respond to everyone, but I work 11am-11pm the next 2 days (yay service industry). So if I haven‚Äôt responded yet, I will definitely try. I‚Äôll be going back to my inbox and on this post and trying to get to everyone. Thank you for taking the time to share and care seriously."

Double annoying: Because we're always fine after a panic attack, a panic attack is actually a sign that everything is fine and you're not in any danger. But its still terrifying every time. I hate panic attacks."

    "text": "Am I in a simulation? My life is all mental agony. So many coincidences seem to happen, so many random thoughts put into my head while just as many or taken. I don‚Äôt feel real, at least a lot of the time. I feel like cutting off my fingers because it might show me something deeper. Like maybe it will bring me back or something like that, just not floating away. I just feel like the repetition in my life exceeds the normal, time doesn‚Äôt seem equal, I don‚Äôt have a cycle I live in, it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm rolling around in tube while others are strapped in. Time used to be the way I went through life to ground me, but it‚Äôs not even able to anymore, It doesn‚Äôt feel real, time doesn‚Äôt feel right. That is why I‚Äôm starting to think that maybe this is all a simulation, or just a lie. Maybe I‚Äôm not even me, maybe I am in a coma and I‚Äôve created this reality to stay sane, but I‚Äôve been in it so long I‚Äôm not keeping it together. Or maybe I‚Äôm waking up and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm out of touch. I laugh at nothing, just sitting in a chair and will randomly start laughing. I don‚Äôt know who I am, or what life is. I have a set of morals, but every so often I switch, it‚Äôs like I do a full 180. Everything is then different, it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm a new person, like a completely different person who would have different friends. It‚Äôs my secondary state luckily, because it‚Äôs the more violent and hateful of the 2 possibly 3 of me. I‚Äôm already full of hate and rage, but it‚Äôs just a supercharged on that secondary version of me. I don‚Äôt know what you think but am I okay? Should I do anything about this, or does it make sense that I might be imagining everything? I made this post to mainly explain how I feel and say stuff to have it possibly heard. Thank you."

It doesn't help that I don't really understand or feel emotions.

If I want to have a chat, I usually imagine someone and have a chat with them. Sometimes i don't even realise I'm doing this. Idk what to do and I've already seen a therapist and they told me that it's anxiety but I genuinely don't feel like it's anxiety since I have no problem in talking, asking questions and doing a presentation in front of people. I feel like I'm going crazy and not normal. If anyone can relate, can you help me in giving me advice on what to do or what's wrong with me?"

I already failed a different final because of it please help me I don't know what to do. My parents call me lazy and say in just don't have the motivation to study when in reality I'm sitting in front of books for hours trying to focus for 10 seconds. My parents are the kind of people who will see a broken foot and tell you to walk it off, see a bad grade and say study more next time. For comparison on how little they take act almost 2 years ago a bump appeared on my forearm, I told them about it worried it would go away after months, it took a year of pleading for them to go see a doctor about it, they went to one local doctor who probably doesn't have a good dagree who said it was fine and they forgot about it (the doctor took 1 test). I have talked to my parents about this. In the middle of me writing this my mum walked in my room and started having a go at me saying I lack motivation to study which is why I can't focus, saying the mess on my desk is the reason I can't focus (I am actively reading when I slip into daydreaming) I told her that she ignores it, and telling me not to feel bad for myself and just get to work. Please help me I can't take it much longer on top of the stress of even keeping up at school. I'm begging."

    "text": "Feeling frustrated To start off, I have very supportive friends with whom I am very close. HOWEVER, some of the things they say out of support feel invalidatingüôÉ I have finally seen a psychologist (and have an appointment set up with a psychiatrist) recently. I‚Äôve been in therapy for years and have felt frustrated with how slow my progress seems to be. That being said, I like my therapist and I had arguably the most life changing year ever last year (the onset of six life altering chronic illnesses does that for ya). I do think my mental health is way better than when I first started therapy, but it‚Äôs been so back and forth when I wish it could feel more linear. I‚Äôm trying to get into a good headspace before I continue pursuing college especially. That‚Äôs what lead me to seeing a psychologist and has me in my current situation. I strongly suspected I had ADHD for a couple of years after my sister was diagnosed. I finally got an examination, and last Wednesday I was diagnosed. This journey in itself was so frustrating because while most of those close to me validated my experiences,I had a handful of people who would say things like ‚Äúwell you don‚Äôt act like my other friend who has it‚Äù or just continuously ask me why I think I have it. They came from a place of trying to be reassuring? But instead it just sucked feeling like I had to explain myself and why I was seeking an examination. When my psychologist diagnosed me, she said ‚ÄúWell, I think it‚Äôs safe to say you have ADHD, but‚Ä¶‚Äù Hence my current dilemma. Basically, during my screening, she said I exhibit very strong signs of having bipolar disorder. She urged me to seek additional screening, as on one specific test, I scored the absolute highest you possibly can for signs of bipolar. I was honestly very shocked but in hindsight, it does make sense. What‚Äôs frustrating is one of my closest friends (and roommate), who is diagnosed with bipolar, told me she doesn‚Äôt think I exhibit signs of it. It was another situation where she was trying to be helpful, but it just fucking sucks. In the days since that appointment, I‚Äôve had one of the worst depressive episodes I‚Äôve had in a long time. It kind of sent me through a loop that I‚Äôm trying very hard to pull myself out of. I‚Äôm now at a point where that appointment felt *validating* because it explains my lack of progress, the constant push and pull I feel inside my brain. Again, I don‚Äôt know for sure at this time, but just knowing a medical professional sees that makes me know I need to at least be checked. And I do have an appointment set up! This friend just also said ‚ÄúI mean, it‚Äôs up to you if you want to get screened.‚Äù And it just feels frustrating. I‚Äôm tired of my mental health journey being compared to others. Just because I don‚Äôt exhibit the same signs as your friend or yourself, doesn‚Äôt mean I can‚Äôt possibly have that experience. My tendency to mask and be ‚Äúhigh functioning‚Äù makes this experience so common for myself. I want to be able to share with my friends and seek support in them, but it seems to backfire as it just leaves me feeling invalidated."

My last relationship that was a situationship left me in a place where i have no one left. I don't have any friends, my family went with me through countless of therapists and centers to try and help and i can't abuse them anymore with the wrong choices i keep making, atleast my mom, my father has been in and out and did more damage when he was in ... The whole ideea is that i can't discuss these issues anymore with my family, i can see its killing my mother and affecting my brother. I wanted to kill myself more than once, had 3 unsuccesful attempts... I am not trying anymore to kill myself because i know how much it would hurt my family and my 2 cats ... But every day my body hurts, i am panicked all the time, i have nobody to talk to, this is my first time ever writing a post, i don't even have facebook anymore.... I don't know how to cope anymore, what to do, and i just want to end it peacefully but i can't. I don't trust therapists and pills anymore they did alot more damage than good... I know all of this is ny fault, i brought all the ugly into my life but i just wanted to feel special or pretty in any way... I abuse substances every day, i can out drink alot of men out here just from the exercise of doing it from my bed all day. I can't connect, i feel like everyone hates me...

Ive realised this is a pattern and each time her behaviours have become more extreme - she‚Äôs crossed the line from pretty minor crimes (criminal damage) to stalking, harassment, criminal damage, inciting her target to commit suicide. I had no idea she was doing this until I recently, when confronted about her behaviour she admitted to parts but attempted to minimise or excuse it. I investigated further and wholeheartedly believe she has done these things based on all the evidence I‚Äôve found. I‚Äôm almost certain she is a narcissistic psychopath and think she‚Äôs on the verge of a psychotic break or is already having it. She‚Äôs going to therapy but she‚Äôs done that before and it‚Äôs changed nothing, she could also be lying about even going. So my question is, is she dangerous? Is it possible to medicate her? Does she sound like she should be sectioned?"

It started off with some panic attacks, anxiety and depression, and I have started self harming as of about 2 months ago. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on with me tbh but I‚Äôve noticed some patterns which I‚Äôm here to ask about. What stands out the most for me is the CONSTANT mood swings. My mood can go from happy and enthusiastic to sad/even depressed in a matter of hours, sometimes even shorter. I‚Äôve noticed my mood can switch either at random, or from very small changes in my surroundings, thoughts, etc. these mood changes are really frustrating and I don‚Äôt know if this is normal or not. It doesn‚Äôt feel normal atleast. I can‚Äôt recall being like this 4 years ago even. I feel like shit because of this and I don‚Äôt trust myself anymore. Note that I‚Äôm not currently as depressed (idek if I even am depressed currently) as I was 2 years ago. My self harm stems from self hatred for the most part. Another thing I‚Äôve noticed that genuinely scares me (im just venting atp), is that my feelings towards people also change drastically as my mood changes. I can go from wanting to talk with the person, love the person etc. to almost feeling a weird type of ‚Äúhatred‚Äù towards them. It‚Äôs hard to describe the exact feeling, but it‚Äôs like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want anything to do with you‚Äù pretty much. What scares me is the feelings are very real and I can barely force myself to go against my brain in these moments. This effects both my friends and family. Could this be something undiagnosed or is it normal? do I bring this up with my psychologist? Thoughts? Thanks, confused guy in his 20s"

    "text": "Should I be worried about my attraction to fictional characters? It‚Äôs killing me inside and makes me miserable ever since I turned 18 So, when I hit about 13 and was watching YouTubers being exposed for being groomers, I suddenly had a thought of ‚Äòwhat if I become like this when I‚Äôm an adult? What if I hurt a child? What if I become a pedophile/groomer/child molester? What if Hurt someone? What if my life gets ruined because of it?‚Äô And it has haunted me ever since. This was around the time when I got into anime and fandom, and also around the time when I first heard the whole idea of ‚Äòif you like it in fiction, you like it in real life‚Äô. My age of attraction has always been higher than my own age growing up, even now I don‚Äôt really feel attracted to girls my own age because they look too smooth and too young for me most of the time. Sometimes there‚Äôd be a sweet spot while I‚Äôd be attracted to girls my own age for once, but then it‚Äôd go away and I‚Äôd no longer be interested. It makes being in highschool at the moment right now really diffucult, because there‚Äôs no one older than me so I can‚Äôt really have crushes, etc.. Other than the teachers, who are just my preference of 30s-60s, which is how old I like women. Makes it hard though because I‚Äôm only 18 and well, most 30 or even 20 year olds don‚Äôt wanna date a freshly 18 year old woman. Hell, I even remember even having crushes on my grandmas friends growing up. Now here comes the issue, with cartoons or anime characters, this dosen‚Äôt apply at all. I‚Äôve never grown out of the anime charcters I‚Äôd like when I was 13, for example, I am still very sexually attracted to nagatoro, whom looks like a young teenager, aswell as other ‚Äòyounger teenager‚Äô characters like say, Capella from Re:zero or Rin Kagamie the vocaloid, The one orange haired girl from oreimo‚Ä¶this is where my distress has been coming from, and it‚Äôs making me extremely anxious. Honestly, any cartoons that look female get me off, including the gals from Scott piligrim, to like, the cars from cars and the teapot from beauty and the beast, but I‚Äôm seriously paranoid about the younger ones. I‚Äôve developed a strong fear of children and honestly, anyone younger than me over the years because of this paranoia and a mix of other things (Bullied heavily in 6th-7th grade and elementary school, molested by a young teenager when I was 10, etc) while I know I‚Äôm not attracted to them, I‚Äôm still always paranoid I might be in the future or I‚Äôm repressing it and it makes me miserable. I hate going to school because of it, because I‚Äôm around people younger than me, and it makes me miserable and scared. And now the fact I still like these characters Is making me extremely paranoid and if this means I‚Äôm attracted to children or young teenagers. I don‚Äôt want to be a pedophile, or anything like that. I never want to hurt anyone. Ever. But I‚Äôm so paranoid that maybe, one day I will. It‚Äôs so miserable. I‚Äôve talked to therapists before, never about the drawings, but about my paranoia and they think I‚Äôm fine and not a pedophile at all but, I‚Äôm still so anxious about it. I spend so much time researching it, and I feel like so many people would think I am a pedophile because of these fucking East Asian cartoon characters and by god, what if I am? What do I do? I honestly wish children didn‚Äôt exist sometimes, or that people under 18 didn‚Äôt exist, I hate being around even 16 year olds or someone in a grade below me. So, Should I be worried about being attracted to younger anime/cartoon characters? Is this unhealthy? Am I going to become a pedophile because of it? Is this the first step to a slippery slope of harming an innocent child or teenager in the future? What do I do? I‚Äôm incredibly paranoid about it and it‚Äôs making me miserable. Any advice is appreciated."

    "text": "My boyfriend has ASPD, i need advice on how to get him help About us: I‚Äôm a 26yo guy and he‚Äôs a 28yo guy, we‚Äôve been together for around a year and a half. I fell for him really quickly, he was so sweet, affectionate, charming, so we became exclusive after about 5 months. He told me he had aspd when we were dating, he told me he had like therapy and stuff when he was 20 and he can manage his mental health well. The situation: once we become exclusive i noticed he started to change a little, he started becoming jealous if i was around other gay/bi men, including my friends, but i didn‚Äôt think anything of it. Some time goes by and we move in together. This is where things started really changing. So I struggle with anxiety, depression and I was diagnosed with adhd around the time we moved in together, I was really struggling with working and juggling the responsibilities of the household because off my mental health. He suggested I quit my job and just stay at home because his salary would be enough, but I was unsure. He kept insisting over a few weeks, he said he hates seeing me struggle so much so I quit my job. We got a joint bank account too. He started becoming really controlling of everything I do, where I go, who I‚Äôm with. We were arguing a lot at this point, he kept blaming my mental health as the reason and I believed him. I tried to get my adhd treated, I was put on meds and I felt better but we kept arguing so I didn‚Äôt think it was my fault. He then started hitting me, he says I make him angry, but he is really apologetic afterwards, but it just became more frequent. He‚Äôs says things that are odd which I know is because he isn‚Äôt in a good place. I have been begging him to please get help because this isn‚Äôt who he used to be, but he won‚Äôt admit that he needs help. I know it‚Äôs not all his fault, I have my part to play but how can I make him see that he needs help? I‚Äôm sorry if parts are badly written I‚Äôm writing this while I‚Äôm really emotional. I just want my boyfriend back to how we was. Can anyone give me any advice?"

After several suicide attempts and in-patient stay and med adjustments, they have become ragey and emotionally abusive. This is not who they are. However I am also not willing to be subject to abuse. Their team has told them they need to minimise stress for 3-4 months while they figure out the proper diagnoses and medication schedule. This likely involves avoiding any kind of commitments and conflicts. We are stuck in a huge conflict cycle due to my partner's lack of accountability and outbursts and I am really suffering because of it. I have so much compassion and empathy for them but I am hurting and can't take it I've expressed that we will need to live separately for me to be able to maintain my own mental health needs and well-being.

    "text": "is there something that can be done? Very disorganized rant, sorry... So, ever since a couple of months ago, my sister has been experiencing paranoid delusions and auditory hallucinations probably due to her MS diagnosis. She claims to hear voices in the walls of her bedroom and accuses my parents of installing a speaker in the wall so her abusive on-and-off again boyfriend can mess with her. She doesn't believe us when we say that's not true and that we don't hear what she's hearing. She also says that there's something about the room that doesn't want her in it? I think that's just because she knows that the room used to be my grandpa's and he died in there but it's just a room at the end of that day... Tonight she kept ringing the doorbell (she's not allowed house keys since her bf took hers before and we had to change the locks) at 10pm but refused to come inside because she was afraid of the house. I guess her boyfriend dumped her. She also was paranoid about him breaking into the house and on one occasion she called the police because she thought she was hearing me being assaulted by him/whoever. This delusion kind of morphed into her thinking I was secretly involved with her boyfriend and started coming into my room at night to search it. It ended up getting a bit aggressive when one night while I was undressed (I told her this) and holding the door closed, she like battering rammed herself in while I was fucking naked! After that, I became pretty cautious and rightfully afraid of her so I got a lock put on my door. But this didn't stop her from pounding on my door some nights, insisting that she heard someone in my room with me. She refuses to believe anything I say and sees everything I do as suspicious. She says that she's been seeing a therapist but only once a month so I'm not really inclined to believe her either. She refuses to voluntarily go to a mental hospital, so am I really just going to have to wait until she hurts herself or me and my parents for something to be done about this situation? So, I guess I'm just asking for advice on what to do about all of this because I'm starting to feel kind of helpless!"

    "text": "Trauma I subconsciously hid from myself For some reason I always feel like I've been through too little to feel the things that I feel. I understand that it isn't comparable but most of the other people in my life don't and they compare me to others. They assume that comparing my life to others with objectively worse lives will make me view my life more positively in comparison. It doesn't. I don't remember a lot of the things I've been through probably as a defense mechanism. This caused my life recently to just be a murder mystery of what happened that was forced out of my memory. Maybe there was never anything at all. But I think something must have caused me to have adult levels of maturity and no will to live since a very early age. I guess people just assume that this is normal and a completely natural thing that happens to people at that age. I know that I've been through things incomprehensible to many people, yet it seems like many assume that they understand every feeling ever and make hideously wrong assumptions about how I feel and what I need. I have symptoms more severe than others that I view as struggling more than me. At times when the symptoms are more severe I feel selfish and ungrateful but at times when the symptoms are less severe I feel like I've been through too much to live a normal life. When I do normal hobbies I feel like I'm wasting time because I have no chance of living a normal and happy life. With the state of the country and how it's going, I'd be lucky to live at all. Actually maybe it would be unlucky to be alive in a world like that. At least my symptoms would be valid at that point. I feel like the only way that I can live an enjoyable life is if I work and try as hard as I can but I already try as hard as I can and it isn't enough. Unfortunately everyone thinks I'm lazy because I don't do as much as others. People say that people should preserve their childhood for as long as possible but I've never had the chance to experience what a proper childhood is like. I don't remember being given adult responsibilities or pressured into maturing faster but something caused me to be this way. I wish I could find out what."

It's often said that crazy people aren't aware of the fact that they're crazy however I wonder if I am daily. I'm I losing my mind? Have I already lost it? Or was I doomed from the start? Is it my parents fault, genetics, or my own overexraggrated imagination? I am a 19 year old male. I should mention that I was diagnosed with ADHD at a young age and was prescribed medicine as a child but was eventually taken off as I approached middle school due to it getting, \" better\" as iv gotten older. My family has no history of Schizophrenia or any mental illness apart from ADHD. So why do I feel the way I feel? Why do I dream the way I dream? Why do I think the way I think? Why does everything correlate with each other? Iv had these weird dreams that lead into each other. Dreams. If you could even call them that. More like nostalgic nightmares. I say nostalgic because it's feel like I belong there in a weird way, horrific yet comforting depending. Why? Why do I feel that way about it. Some of the dreams I would record and look at from a logical standpoint. As there is a lot of ways you can tell if your dreaming. Things such as not being able to tell time, reading/ lack of comprehension skills, lack of control ect. All of which seem to add up. Yes. Just typical Dreams I believe. Shortly after turning 15 I started having these weird vibrations in the center of my head when I played down to go to sleep. Iv have had them before but not like this. Not all of the time but every so often. Skeptic? Ik. I don't blame you I am to. I still don't believe anything I feel regarding this is real. I don't believe that I'm special or that I experienced some sort of,\" awakening\". During these vibrational periods over a while I've Been able to get that feeling on command but only while laying down. When I give it to that vibration it spreads from my head to the rest of my body especially my finger tips. From there if I give into It ill end up asleep but in this world. The dreams I have don't feel like dreams. Call them lucid if you want but this still doesn't check out. None of the former rules apply anymore. I can read, I can understand and communicate, I have control of myself but not the people around me. But there are two things that's always stood out to me. One pain in this,\"place\" ,\"state of mind\",dream\" whatever is very real mental and physical. Two unlike typical dreams when you die in this place instead of waking up it take you somewhere else. The most considering part about that is it's always the same places. Another thing I should mention is that in this place I have never seen anyone that I know personally like in dreams. My mom, dad, family friends nothing. Just strangers. Some kind, some not so much, some completely unhinged, and some not even human. Extremely horrific beings. As well as emotions I can't explain nor feel in the real world. As a child I grew up with a religious grandfather, my mother and step father. My mother believed in demons, angles ect. My dads always been Skeptical. And my grandfather that goes without saying. When I was around 8 years old we lived in this house. location lexington Kentucky, Jackson Street ‚Äê--‚Äê--‚Äê- A house with a lot of questionable history we didn't know of. Iv never really believed in demons, or anything like that for the longest. Maybe my it was my childish imagination or maybe I saw something I wasn't supposed to. I would see shadows around the house, back door constantly slamming in the kitchen throughout the night, and distorted voices and stepping sounds coming from the kitchen not just a night but also throughout the day. I went to the school near there at the time William wells brown. A great school and as much as I love my parents going to school was the only good thing I would look forward to due to the amount of dread I would feel the moment I walk into that horid house. The worst part is no one would believe me until a month in and it started getting worse my dad went from Skeptic to full believe. My mom and dad own a boxed wooden dresser well over 200lbs quite literally impossible for a draft to knock over. Until one night my mom and dad where laying in bed then they said it flipped over. My dad was the first out of the bedroom leaving my mom behind out of fear lol. From here on out things got even worse. At the time my cousins where staying with me. We feel asleep in my room on the floor. That same night woke up unable to move that was my first time experiencing sleep paralysis as you could imagine I was terrified. After what felt like 5 mins I could move but when I looked upon the wooden stand we had that held the whatnotts/ dolls we had that hung from the wall. There was one corrupted doll in particular that didnt look the same. What was once a piggy bank dog animal that my uncle had won for my mom via carnival game. Was now a dreadfull, black eyed, clearly in distressed baby doll with what looked to be wearing a bid and a dirty ripped bonnet. At this moment even though I wasn't sleeping this was the first time I had felt that same vibration I felt when I got older. Apart from my head and shoulders vibrating like crazy I was overwhelmed with adrenaline, dread, and disgust. While still maintaining eye contact with the entity I tried tapping my cousin next to me to wake up. When he did wake up, he couldn't really understand what I was trying to tell him until I told him again and again to look up. Eventually I gave up and bolted out of the room. He followed soon after with a scream. I'm not sure if he ran and screamed because I left him in a dark room by himself or because he saw what I saw but whenever I did ask him he swears he doesn't remember. That same scream my cousin let out ended up waking both mine and his parents. I then started to explain what happened to and what it looked like. If I had to describe as a of today I would say it looked almost like the baby that fell from the celling from Trainspotting. Soon after that we moved out. We need up moving to a house right across the street from this one. Same street name, cover store, school and all. But this time the issue wasn't the house. As i said before my grandfather is a religious man. And so he always took me to church with him on Sundays. I loved Sunday school. Even though i was a bad kid and usually ended up in trouble. But this particular day we ended up get someone new. A girl who appeared to be around my age. But something was off about her something I didn't like. In Sunday school we had a small room all of the kids would go into it had coloring books, TV, a table and chairs that went all around it. At this table we all sat at and around lunch time is when they introduced her. We she came in she was wearing black shoes, white old fashioned leggs that led into a white dress. She had brown hair and her skin was extremely pale and abnormal, glossy like almost like a doll, like she was made out of plastic. From the moment they brought her in i Immediately wanted to do nothing more than leave. I experienced that same vibration again only this time another feeling came along with it. Canny? This was my first time ever experiencing a canny valley like ordeal. I was still a kid so I had no idea what I was feeling at the time. It was just abundance of fear and I felt trapped in that small room with her. She didn't look human but for someone reason I must have been the only in the room that felt that way because no one look bothered. After a few minutes of being around her I feel sick to my stomach and immediately made and excuse to my Sunday school teacher that I needed to use the bathroom. That was a lie. As soon as I left the room I booked it up there stairs into the main room where my grandfather was. He asked me why I wasn't in Sunday school and I told him why. He proceed to call me silly and laughed. He then gave me a hug grabbed my hand and walked me back down the stairs back to class. When my pops and me walked into the class he got a look at the girl and then turned around and gave me and strange unnerving look. A face I had never seen before. He then grabbed my hand once more and led me back up stairs with him. He turned back to look at me once again but this time he had a distraught look in his face almost as if a tear was about to fall from his eyes. Which is saying a lot because iv only seen my pops cry twice in my life. He's a tough man that has been through a lot. He kept me up there with him until the last 5 mins of the main service was left then walked me out to the parking lot and we left. He still goes to that same church till this day but he took a couple weeks break from that one after that day. When I got older I eventually asked him what happened. The first time he act like it never happened. The second time he told me somethings are just better left alone. That was the last vibrational feeling I had until after I turned 15. To be honest I'm not really all that religious I believe in a god but I skeptical of a lot of things. For one the vibrations I feel. That may be some mental issues but idk. If so I would love to heard some thoughts. And for the record I have zero TBIs. All my mental and physical medical records are clean. What's wrong with me?"

So I usually take Vraylar (mainly for depression, mood swings, and my fear of developing schizophrenia) and Atomexitne ( non stimulant adhd cause i am sensitive to serotonin). I recently moved in september 24 and i was given a 3 month supply of my meds in early august to hold me over till i can get a new provider, with the knowing that if not possible, i could do telemed with my psych and therapist. That to say the least hasn't been a option. I have been off of my Vraylar for 6 months now? and i basically just use my ADHD med to help me wake up early for work when necessary. Idk if its my symptoms coming back, and altering my thoughts due to my situation in life (like working and taking care of my bro and gf) my knoweledge of mental health, and the fact i havent been on my meds essentially gaslighting me into thinking im declining or if i am okay, and my therapy and psych knowledge and plans set for me are helping, and things are just hard to deal with because its mental health, ofc its hard to deal with. also the chemical imbalance im putting myself through by picking and choosing when to take my adhd meds Sorry for the long Rant, i was just wondering if anyone else has experienced or is experiencing this at all"

    "text": "Struggling with Betrayal and Past Insults. How Do I Move On? Hi, I'm 25M, and lately, I feel like I'm starting to hate everyone. I had a close friend from college who helped me get into his company, and I was grateful for that. But as time passed, I started getting better opportunities‚Äîhigher salary, chances to work in other states, and overall career growth. I used to share my work experiences and achievements with him, thinking he‚Äôd be happy for me, but he would instantly cut my calls whenever I spoke about work. Later, through a mutual friend, I found out that he had been badmouthing me. Once, I told my friends about partying and dancing with girls at a pub, and he went and told them about how I got rejected in college and became afraid to talk to girls after that. Yes, it happened, but why bring it up just to embarrass me? He also had a crush on a girl, but he would constantly criticize her dressing, how she posts pictures, and even trash-talked her and her ex to me. He said he‚Äôd never love her, but suddenly, he committed to her and hid it from me. When he finally told me, he acted like nothing had happened. To make things worse, he‚Äôd mock me in front of others, saying I never dressed well before getting my job, and even told a senior that I wouldn‚Äôt be a software engineer without his help. I‚Äôve decided to cut him off, but I can‚Äôt forget the past insults. I stopped talking to him for 2 years, But he's still in my instagram followers list and couldn't block him because he will reach out to me asking why or through mutual friends and it would really embarass me. what to do ? How do I truly move on from this? How do I stop feeling this hatred?"

    "text": "I need help On November 6th 2023 I tried to kill myself. I had been planning/writing my notes for about a week beforehand, when I finally decided that that night would be the night I did it. I stole my grandfather's gun, a half of a bottle of rum, and a bottle of pills as an extra measure. I drove maybe a half a mile down the road from my house at about 4am and parked next to a small gated field where I had gone to have multiple mental breakdowns beforehand and sat for a while, trying to build up the courage. I drank the rum (I had never drank before this point, only gotten high) and sat with it for a minute to try and ease my fight or flight, fortunately, it made me want to live again, at least long enough for me to call my sisters boyfriend and have him come pick me up, and take me home. Then I went to the psych ward, blah blah blah, not the point I'm trying to get at. I recently just haven't been able to stop thinking about that night and if I had actually gone through with it. I've even had times where I've doubted that I didn't didn't do it, and that everything happening now isn't just my brains final moments dying. But that kind of makes me sound crazy so I don't tell many people that. And it's not that I don't have anyone to talk to about it technically, I just don't have anyone I can tell that isn't too invested in me to be of any help. What I mean by that is that I have great friends and family that are there for me and want to help me, but the problem is that my friends either can't relate with me enough to understand and will freak out and tell my parents, or as for my parents, they care and want to take care of me and help me, but they will try to put me into some kind of lock down mode and have constant check-ins or suggest even going back to the psychward every time, non of which helps me, and I just need someone who understands and is here for me, not someone who will either over react, or down play it. Tldr: I can't stop thinking about the time I tried to kill myself and I feel like if I tell the people in my support system they'll overreact"

I can‚Äôt talk to people IRL because they mock this. For about ten years this person has been obsessed with being a professional football player. They played for a junior college and spent a lot of time training and being great but not NFL material. We thought it would stop after college but he only became more dedicated and all this talk about scouting and how he‚Äôd been contacted for deals sounded like bragging or lying to ppl who knew him. It didn‚Äôt help that it was all he could talk about or bring up, so everyone got annoyed and thought he was just trying to lie. Im not saying this to be a jerk or ruin his dream but he‚Äôs over 30 now and somebody as football obsessed should know that it doesnt really happen at this point. The main point that‚Äôs freaking me out is he posted these things of like an ‚Äúunknown number‚Äù missed call and he‚Äôs convinced it was a scouter and he needs to figure out who to get his chance back. To me this is the point where something is seriously wrong if something as simple as a missed spam call registers as a career in the NFL. He has been posting basically essays nonstop for days defending why this is legit and how upset he is and i cant twll if his mother thinks this is true or if she‚Äôs just trying to comfort him. Like i said this has been going on for years but it‚Äôs never escalated to this level of him being upset and it scares me that this all started from a simple spam call. To see him this confused and freaked out makes me think maybe he isn‚Äôt safe or conscious if that makes sense?"

    "text": "question about a mental hospital stay I have put some thought to it. Recently I was at a mental hospital for about three months (wasn't my first stay) and I got diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. My therapist recommended that I should do interval therapy (staying at the mental hospital for 2-3 weeks every 1-2 months) to help me get more stable. I still go to school and I don't like the concept of interval therapy. Everything would be very stressful and chaotic. I'd always have to change between staying at home and being at the hospital. Normally I would've graduated this year but because of my mental health and long stay at the hospital I will have to repeat this year. If I do this interval therapy I won't be able to go to school normally at all and I probably won't be able to get proper grades. I'm aware that I probably won't be able to go on like this right now because I'm very unstable but i genuinely don't want to go to the hospital again. I love being home with my family and friends but I know that I do need therapy. Is there anything I could do? I still have some time to decide whether to go or not. My next planned stay should be at the end of April but I must say, I did not really have ANY profit the last time I was there. There were so many (to me at least) unnecessary therapies. I want to do therapies to help me regulate my feelings and anxiety, how to live with myself and my emotions and I really want to do trauma therapy. I do already have some knowledge and I don't think it's necessary to draw my emotions, to pet animals, to exercise or what skills are. I don't really know if I should go. I really don't want to but I really want to get betterüò≠"

My thoughts roam with obsessive/absurd ideas making it difficult to calm down and relax, my muscles start aching and I feel as I become more distressed to the point of showing physical agitation. I start sweating as if someone raised the temperature in the room, the discomfort of my being in my own skin, the agitation continues to gnaw at me while my brain screams at me. I can‚Äôt breathe and It‚Äôs triggering. As the distress and feeling of a panicked emergency take‚Äôs place, I want to desperately run to someone, get on my knees and beg for help, I need help. By then and now I feel trapped and paralyzed, I feel imprisoned and my own body won't respond. I don‚Äôt want to feel this way again. I want to make it stop, I'm scared. Forget being scared because by then everything is already out of control. Something is very wrong but I don‚Äôt know, I don‚Äôt know what it is but I need help because my mind is screaming and it‚Äôs triggering, I want it to stop, please. Oh, by then I can‚Äôt stop sobbing, I can‚Äôt control my tears. By then it felt like I met my demise again and again. Something about being in distress while being screamed at just goes together. While being yelled at and confronted for not listening and cooperating, I try to control my breathing because by then I'm hyperventilating and having a panic attack. It felt like the world just collapsed on me, this is not what I wanted, in such a situation I didn‚Äôt think that I would be finding myself worried that the neighbor‚Äôs would hear me getting screamed at and that a poor indoor grill had to face the wrath of suddenly being broken due to this person all because I couldn't stop my panic attack and it pissed them off.

This fear has driven me to feel deep shame about lying, doing anything weird or gross in private, etc.. At times makes it hard for me to relax and at its worst it makes me feel terrified and ruminate on my perceived bad actions and imagining everyone finding out about them.

From people tapping on shit, to the annoying ass ASMR videos where people are whispering, any of it. It makes me absolutely infuriated. I have the same reaction to people that eat with their mouth open. I would never act on these impulses, but it makes me want to destroy things in a fit of rage, especially the person doing it."

    "text": "Partner being discharged from psych ward today - I'm worried about them coming home and confused about team's advice for taking accountability My partner (NB, late 20s) is being discharged today after a serious mental health crisis that involved a manic SH episode and SI. Their psychiatrist has diagnosed them with PMDD with some bipolar and OCD traits. They‚Äôre autistic and have ADHD. They were previously on Fluoxetine and Vyvanse, but it triggered mania, suicidality, and toxicity. Now they‚Äôre being discharged on Lamotrigine, an antipsychotic, Zoely (birth control for PMDD), calcium, Vitamin D, and a different stimulant. 1. Confused about \"taking too much accountability\" Last night, they told me: -They feel scared to come home because of our \"dynamic.\" -Their psychologist and social worker told them they‚Äôre taking too much accountability for our conflicts because \"it takes two.\" -They feel like I‚Äôm always criticizing them and never seeing the good. -They feel like my expectations are too high and that they can't meet them. -They don‚Äôt know what this means for our future or whether we can even live together. -They feel like they don‚Äôt even know what I look like anymore (it‚Äôs been six days). -They said they‚Äôre tired of masking around me‚Äîbut previously told me I was the one person they don‚Äôt have to mask around. This really threw me. I never asked them to take 100% accountability - just to actually acknowledge and change the behaviors that hurt me. I don‚Äôt understand what their team is telling them because, from my perspective, the cycle is: 1. I bring up a concern calmly. 2. They react defensively, shut down, or deflect. 3. I try to stay calm and explain my perspective. 4. They continue to deflect or misrepresent my concerns, and eventually, I get frustrated and reactive. 5. The original issue gets buried under their emotional response or my eventual frustration. 6. Later, they apologize and say they want to change, but the cycle repeats. I know my own reactivity is part of this, but I don‚Äôt understand what ‚Äútaking too much accountability‚Äù means in this context. I know my partner often omits key details when speaking to mental health professionals (their conditions got so bad because they were under representing how bad it was for them) and I am wondering whether I'm in the wrong or whether they're not explaining the situation objectively to their team for them to say this. I've never blamed the 'dynamic' solely on my partner but I'll readily ask them to take accountability for their side of the road. And I do the same whether or not they raise this with me. I'm just confused. 2. My grandma died yesterday, and after begging for my partner's support, they still couldn't show up in a stable and supportive way despite being discharged and coming home today. When I spoke to them after she passed, they were cold, detached, and emotionally unavailable. Instead of holding space for me, they focused on their own fears about coming home, our relationship, and whether we should even be together. This isn‚Äôt the first time. Every time I‚Äôve dealt with a major loss or crisis, they‚Äôve either been emotionally absent or actively made things worse. I don‚Äôt feel emotionally safe with them. Meanwhile, I have supported them through: -Their mental health crises (including helping get them hospitalized). -Visiting them almost daily in the hospital while juggling my grandma's impending death and visits, an intense work schedule and schedule for second job and and a sick pet. -Picking up all household and financial responsibilities alone. -Advocating for their care and researching resources. -Providing patience, space, and emotional labor during their dysregulated episodes. I don‚Äôt understand how I can do all of that, but it seems that they don't see it and think my requests for support are asking for too much? 3. \"Your expectations are too high.\" They told me they feel like I only ever criticize them and that my standards are impossible to meet. But my expectations are literally just: -Follow through on what you say you‚Äôll do. -Take responsibility for how your words/actions affect me. -Communicate instead of shutting down or getting defensive. -Be emotionally present and consider your feelings instead of immediately reacting to them as if they're true. They'll often hear criticism in my words that simply isn't there, or read into them the worst possible interpretation and I feel like I'm constantly saying 'i didn't say that though'. Recently, they've taken to saying 'intent doesn't matter' (because I told them that intent doesn't matter if they're running late and meant to text me but didn't for example) and so if they read into my words meaning that is literally not there that it's my fault because intent doesn't matter. I tell them, no, I said the words I said and that's all I mean. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs unreasonable. I don‚Äôt expect perfection, just effort. 4. This used to just be PMDD, but now it‚Äôs not. In the past, these patterns were confined to their luteal phase. But now, it‚Äôs happening outside of luteal. I don‚Äôt know if this is: -A medication reaction (they just started an antipsychotic and Lamotrigine and oral contraceptive) -A sign that there‚Äôs another condition at play (bipolar? CPTSD? something else?). -The mask slipping and this is just who they are. They flip between loving me and acting like they barely care. Their opinion of me changes dramatically based on their emotions. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs real anymore. My questions: 1. What does it mean when a psych team says someone is taking too much accountability? What are they seeing that I‚Äôm not? 2. Are my expectations actually too high? Should I just accept that this is all they can give? 3. Why do they only seem to realize what they‚Äôve done after the damage is done? Why does it take me getting upset for them to have self-awareness? 4. Has anyone dealt with something similar? How do you tell the difference between mental illness symptoms vs. fundamental personality traits? 5. Would breaking up be the only real option? I‚Äôm not in a place where I can financially move out right now, but I feel so exhausted and trapped. I feel like I‚Äôm going crazy here. Would love some outside perspectives."

    "text": "Paranoid Schizophrenia TW: assault Hi. I‚Äôm not sure exactly what to do but after researching and trying, this is my last stop. My sister was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia in the past couple years. I‚Äôm quite distant from my family and me and my sister are even more distant. I never got along with my family so the caretaking of her has been taboo for me. The only link I have to her is that she constantly thinks everyone is telling her she graped me. I‚Äôve attempted multiple times to tell her that didn‚Äôt happen but every time she‚Äôs off meds, she spirals and this is her only repeating thought. It‚Äôs starting to affect me since I did actually get assaulted twice (no connection to her) and my parents didn‚Äôt care at all but they constantly call me to reassure her that she didn‚Äôt do anything to me. In recent years, we‚Äôve attempted to mend our relationship with little to no hope. My family is quite avoidant and starting to give up on her and although we don‚Äôt have a good relationship, I‚Äôd rather learn how to help her with this and stay with her than for her to be completely abandoned. Help please ."

    "text": "BPD hallucinations and paranoid Ideation I have BPD and it causes me to hallucinate. Mostly people who talk to me about things that make me feel really insecure and then they vanish or false memories that pop up or sensations of being places I'm not. I have paranoid Ideation. It sucks. Like I know it's not real but I still think it is. I'm on medication but it only really affects my moods. I've been hallucinating for over 10 yrs. I didn't know at first. I just thought it was a glitch or something. Like an unexplained thing that everyone experiences. I just am constantly on edge. It's really holding me back. Sometimes I get deep into the false ideas and stuff. I will just stop taking care of myself or be disappointed that the stuff isn't real. I get periods of euphoria and I'm more likely to hallucinate during that. I start to think I'm over everything rough I feel. Then I just get so depressed when I realize it's not real. That I've been wasting my time. The worst of my paranoid thoughts manifests as hearing myself in others conversations and thinking bad things are gonna happen. I struggle to be open so I feel I have to pretend these things don't happen. I got diagnosed with BPD a year ago. My psychiatrist dropped me because they didn't think I needed check ins so often. I have a thing where I always think I have to be doing well. Sometimes I don't feel that way but I cannot put it into words. I've had a few psychiatrists. Been misdiagnosed with a lot. I don't think I'm getting the care I should yet I can't talk about it. I'm doing rough internally. Nobody gets it. I can't explain it either."

    "text": "How do you get through it? Was there a point when you knew, that life is worth living it? What makes a life worth living? I know... that's a big and very loaded question. From the outside, my life would surely be described as worth living. I'm 34, mother of 3 wonderful kids, since last summer separated from my still-husband but we still get along very well. I have a job, a home, no financial struggles. My parents help with the kids and more and are very understanding. Still, I hate my life. Not the people in it. They are all great! I love my kids very much! Life is just so very exhausting. Of course, there are good moments, there always will be. Still, I just don't understand why people like living. I hate it. And I hate the thought, that I still have to exist 40 to 60 more years. I have weekly sessions with a great psychologist and meds that help. I have a severe depression and since december an autism diagnosis. That explains, why I never felt like I belonged. I really am trying to get my life sorted out. To adjust it to my needs, since I ignored them for 34 years. But that's a slow process. You can't change your neurotypical life in a few weeks into an autism friendly one. And I really don't know if I'll ever like living. If it ever will be less exhausting. I really don't want to live anymore. But I can't quit, so I won't. Because I have kids, and they don't deserve a dead mother. I don't know what I want to get out of this post. Nothing I guess. I just needed to get it out. Tomorrow I go to my job like every day, smile at the people around me like every day, cry in the evening like every day."

    "text": "7 years of isolation amde me hate humans I wrote this in Arabic first, but here is the English translation: From the age of 18 to 25, the number of friends I spent my youth with and shared the most important moments of my life with is literally the most depressing number in existence: zero. Since I graduated high school, every attempt to experience any form of human connection has only resulted in failure, embarrassment, and shame. I wouldn‚Äôt even mind if my relationship with someone was full of drama and problems‚ÄîI just want to feel like I still exist. These past seven years have not been easy. At first, I felt a bit of hope, but it quickly turned into panic, fear, and constant rejection from people. I ended up completely alone with my thoughts. When intrusive thoughts hit me, making me feel like something bad is about to happen‚Äîlike a heaviness in my hands that makes me unable to lift them, weakness in my legs, or my heart beating too fast‚ÄîI start thinking these are all symptoms of a heart attack. Literally, everything in me and everything I see around me becomes a reminder that I‚Äôm about to die, and there‚Äôs nothing or no one to take that fear away from me. And it‚Äôs not just about death. It‚Äôs also about losing my sight, my hearing, spinal injuries, and so much more. Every single thought that enters my mind forces itself into my reality, and with no one around, there‚Äôs no one to reassure me that I‚Äôm just imagining things. These fears inevitably forced me to find a way to cope and reduce their intensity. And what was the only way I found to lessen these obsessive thoughts and fears for seven years‚Äîand still rely on today? The only thing that relieved me, even a little, was putting on my headphones, playing music, pacing back and forth in my room, and imagining people talking to me. I would physically react, talk to myself, laugh, feel sad, get angry, cry, and experience every emotion I‚Äôve been deprived of. Most of the time, these imaginary conversations weren‚Äôt even related to my intrusive thoughts at all. Just imagining another person engaging with me‚Äîeven about random topics‚Äîsomehow made me feel a little comforted. I feel like I‚Äôm missing any presence of another being in my life. What hurts me even more is that one time, I was walking on the sidewalk, and two people were walking toward me, shoulder to shoulder. One of them needed to step back so we could all pass without bumping into each other. But to my surprise, neither of them moved aside, and my shoulder collided hard with one of theirs. The strange thing is, I didn‚Äôt get angry or upset at all. On the contrary, my first thought was that I hadn‚Äôt felt another human being in so long. Any touch, even a random bump or an accidental hit‚ÄîI don‚Äôt mind. Just anything that reminds me that I still exist in this world. The feeling that no one knows me isn‚Äôt just about \"no one knows me.\" It feels like I‚Äôve been exiled from existence itself. Why haven‚Äôt I been able to form any real human connection to this day? Why have I been deprived of something that shouldn‚Äôt be this hard at all? Other people also want to connect with others, but they don‚Äôt want me. No one I‚Äôve ever met has been as isolated and alone as I am. Everyone has at least one friend, even if their friend is annoying, stupid, or insufferable. But me‚Äîspecifically me‚Äîno one wants. I am the outcast, the unwanted one, the one with a personality that even I hate, and everyone else hates, too. Every time I tried to make an effort to form friendships, my weirdness and terrible social skills would show in the most embarrassing way possible. From kindergarten to the end of middle school, I spent most of my time alone, and my friends were extremely limited. I feel like this affected my basic social skills when trying to meet new people. I didn‚Äôt know how to introduce myself properly or pick up on the social cues people use. I was literally dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb. No one would ever be proud to walk next to someone like that. So, of course, I remained alone. But in high school, somehow, by pure coincidence, my social life suddenly flourished because of a few lucky events. I don‚Äôt even know how it happened. I felt popular, I enjoyed school, and my personality improved in a way that made me unable to imagine my life without my friends. But then we graduated. And now, here I am‚Äî25 years old, feeling like my personality is stuck at 18 or 19. I haven‚Äôt achieved anything, I don‚Äôt know anyone, and I haven‚Äôt moved forward from my room. Every time I look into people‚Äôs eyes in the street, it feels like my shame takes the form of a giant being in the sky, crushing what little self-worth I have left. I feel my inferiority, my delay, my weakness. I feel envious of everyone. My future is over. I won‚Äôt say I want to kill myself or anything like that, because I‚Äôm not stupid. I know full well that if I did, the only reaction people would have would be mockery, ridicule, and laughter at me and everything I‚Äôve felt‚Äîall the emotions that no one knows about. I don‚Äôt blame them. I mean, what else would you expect from a weirdo who lived seven years unnoticed? Did you really think there would be any other reaction? Huh, you idiot? That‚Äôs why I would never harm myself through suicide. Because that would only prove everyone right‚Äîthat my existence is as good as nonexistent. Honestly, even calling myself \"human\" is a compliment, because I‚Äôm less than that. No one has ever acknowledged my existence, as if I was meant to be erased from the world, as if I never felt any of the emotions they feel. But my will is strong. And I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôll become a criminal or physically attack people‚Äîno, never. That‚Äôs not who I am. But I swear, all the pain and isolation I‚Äôve felt will have an impact. The suffering that has destroyed my body and drained me‚ÄîI will return it to the world. My pain has meaning. My emotions have value. No matter how much I want to reconnect with people, I can‚Äôt force myself to forget these past seven years. I just wanted someone to look at me like a normal person. Forget being a friend‚Äîjust a normal human being. And then maybe, maybe we could become friends. But everyone sees me as weird. I swear, I hate all of you. I swear to God, I hope you all suffer and feel pain, and I won‚Äôt allow myself to feel any sympathy. Because sympathy is mutual, and if no one feels for me, I swear I won‚Äôt feel for them either. If I‚Äôm not human like you, then you‚Äôre not human to me either. This time has been enough to prove to me that I have no value in this world. My life has been at a standstill, and it still is. My existence is as good as nothing. But I will make sure my feelings don‚Äôt just disappear like they never existed. With whatever remains of my life, I will make sure I prove my existence to everyone, and I will take my revenge."

    "text": "I'm going through immense suffering and people are laughing at me. I‚Äôm exhausted. Every day, I wake up and go to the hospital. I‚Äôve seen doctors from almost every department, and yet, every single one tells me it‚Äôs just anxiety. I panic over the smallest things‚Äîlike a tiny scratch‚Äîconvinced it will turn into something serious. No matter how irrational it seems, I can‚Äôt stop myself from rushing to the hospital. Today, the staff even laughed at me because I‚Äôm there so often. I felt like a clown. Meanwhile, I see people my age enjoying life‚Äîriding bikes with their partners, hanging out with friends‚Äîwhile I waste my time and my parents‚Äô money on hospital visits. My biggest fear right now? That my penis is permanently damaged due to extreme masturbation‚Äî10 to 20 times a day for the past 10 years. I‚Äôve had erectile dysfunction since 2022, and I suspect I have Peyronie‚Äôs disease, even though multiple urologists ruled it out. They say my penis looks normal, but how can they be sure without proper tests like a Penile Doppler Test? I‚Äôve also been experiencing extreme numbness and discoloration in one part of my penis, yet doctors keep saying it‚Äôs okay. Are they being dismissive just because they assume my anxiety is making me imagine things? Do they have some kind of preconceived notion or prejudice against me‚Äîthat I‚Äôm just an anxious, paranoid person and not worth taking seriously? But where did this anxiety even start? Is it genetic? My father was always an anxious person‚Äîstressing over things others wouldn‚Äôt. He used to hit me almost every day until the 9th or 10th grade. I couldn‚Äôt fight back. As I grew older, I became toxic too. I started taking out my anger on my mother. The cycle of abuse continued until one day, I cut off contact with my father. He stopped abusing me, but I couldn‚Äôt stop myself from physically harming my mother. It became a part of our daily lives, and I know that‚Äôs not normal. The worst part? Outside my home, I‚Äôm a completely different person. I don‚Äôt bully anyone. I don‚Äôt get into fights. But the moment I step inside, I become someone else. I hate it. Sometimes, I feel like ending my life. But I don‚Äôt want to die. I still believe I can turn things around. I just don‚Äôt know how. I want to be loved. I want to be a good person. I want to be happy. The happiest time in my life? When I was dating my ex. That was the first time I truly fell in love. I‚Äôve been in relationships before, but this was different. I felt so joyful, so alive. And strangely, that was the period when I masturbated the least. My lust disappeared. I respected her so much that I couldn‚Äôt even think of her sexually, especially in the beginning. It felt like divine love‚Äîlove without lust. I was obsessed with her, ready to do anything for her. But in the end, she ruined me. She cheated on me too. So, what is it? Can love heal me? Or is it something I have to fix on my own? Am I like this because I‚Äôve spent years stuck inside my room with no social life? I didn‚Äôt go to a regular college. After high school, I just stayed at home. Could that be the reason my mental health is so bad? Would having more sexual experiences help? I don‚Äôt know what to do. I believe in God. I pray all the time, asking for relief, for happiness, for peace. But I‚Äôm still suffering. I just want to sit by the beach, watch the sunset, feel the breeze, and relax. But my mind won‚Äôt let me. Even as I write this, my anxiety is telling me something terrible is about to happen. That I‚Äôll get diagnosed with some awful disease. That my worst fears will come true. And if that happens, what will I do? Cry? Give up? Live in misery forever? I don‚Äôt know. But I do know I need to change. I need to save myself. I just don‚Äôt know where to start. If you‚Äôve read this far, thank you. Please, any advice or suggestions would mean a lot."

    "text": "MENTAL ILLNESS IS NO DIFFERENT FROM PHYSICAL ILLNESS! mental health struggles aren't something anyone chooses, just like no one decides to get a cold or break a bone. they're not a reflection of your worth, your strength, or your character. it's biology, chemistry, and life circumstances‚Äîthings largely out of our control. blaming someone for this is as irrational as blaming them for getting a heart attack. mental illness is no different from physical illness, yet society often treats them unfair. would you tell someone with a broken leg to just ‚Äúwalk it off‚Äù? of course not. would you tell someone to just ‚Äúsnap out of‚Äù diabetes or asthma? obviously no. so why do people say things like ‚Äújust think positive‚Äù to someone with depression? why should mental health be any different? brains are organs just like hearts and lungs and they can get out of balance too. it's not a matter of willpower or weakness; it's about understanding and treatment. the stigma around mental illness has kept so many people from seeking help or speaking openly, so shouldn't we at least make an effort to change that narrative? the more we treat mental health like physical health‚Äîno shame, no blame, just care‚Äîthe more we can encourage people to get the support they deserve. everyone deserves compassion, especially from themselves. let‚Äôs normalize healing."

I feel like I‚Äôm sneaking behind my psychs back but if she‚Äôs not willing to help me then idk what to do. I feel so suicidal rn.

    "text": "My autistic friend has an unhealthy obsession with running for president... My friend \"A\" is the smartest, funniest, coolest person I know, but he has a very unhealthy obsession with running for president of the United States. While part of me thinks he could win, he has no qualifications, has never held office, never held a job, never attended college, and rarely leaves his house. He did make several million dollars in his 20s by gambling and investing, which he says he will spend on his campaign if he has to. He says the only thing that motivates him to leave the house is the thought of running for president and making a difference. He is also slightly autistic, though he is definitely high functioning. He was diagnosed with Asperger's as a kid but has told me that is no longer a valid diagnosis. He says he'd like to be a light for other autistic people, which does make me think I could be underestimating him, but I don't know... My heart wants to tell him to try but he's also said he doesn't want to make a fool of himself. The problem is he's good. He knows every politician's name, he knows all this stuff about policy, and he's actually a kind, good man. He's articulate, he's charming, he knows just which words to say, and when he hits his groove I swear his fake speeches are as good as Barack Obama's real ones. He used to have speech problems and was a very shy kid, so he's spent years perfecting his speaking abilities in front of a mirror. When we were teenagers he told me, \"If I can master my biggest weakness, talking to people, I can do anything.\" Well he went from being shy and socially awkward to one of the best speakers I've ever seen. I find him very inspiring, but I'm scared for him. Running for POTUS is no joke. He will turn 35 before the next presidential election, and likes to tell me he would be the youngest person to ever run for president. He also has all these plans he's worked on that may or may not be good ideas. So he is showing every indication he is serious about this. He's talked about it forever and always says he's been planning this for most of his life. But \"A\" struggled with drug addiction for years and also has some mental health problems, although he can be good at hiding it. He is mostly sober now besides a little alcohol/weed, and I am proud of him for that, but running for president still seems crazy. He has had these sort of manic episodes in the past when he's gotten really stressed, and I'm afraid of what might happen if he takes the plunge. I'd love for him to prove the world wrong, but how do I prepare to help him if he goes down in a ball of flames? He has said that not trying will make him feel like a failure. He also admits it will be hard to win, and admits he does not expect to win, but still thinks he might. Do I help my good friend with his longshot bid to become the 48th president, or should I try to stop this train in case it becomes a trainwreck? Any advice would be appreciated... Also sorry if this is the wrong place to post this, I wasn't sure."

    "text": "Does it really get better? I (F28) am having suicidal thoughts again. For context, I‚Äôve always struggled with suicidal thoughts and thoughts about wanting to die since I was about 8. I grew up in an abusive household within a narcissist family unit. I still live with them unfortunately and have struggled since I was 15 to leave my home. For the longest time, my parents didn‚Äôt allow me to have a job, a bank account, nor did they teach me how to drive. I wasn‚Äôt every allow to go out or even so much as to go over to a friends house. I first attempted when I was around 16 and within one month I was hospitalized 3 different times. I basically spent Christmas in a mental health facility. My mom attempted to legally disabled me, never understood why. My family always complained about me not being able to do anything for myself because I was never taught to do anything by my family so it‚Äôs ironic to me that they tried to disable because wouldn‚Äôt that mean you‚Äôre the ones stuck taking care (or lack there of) of me? Anyway, I reached these basic milestones of getting a job and car through trail and error on my own. Even then, my biggest challenge has been moving out and cutting off my family. I live in Florida so rent is absurdly expensive and I definitely want to move out of the state and then I remember that I have to essentially buy my own freedom. I recently lost my job and have been nonstop applying trying to find even a shitty job just to have consistent income and not have to do ubereats all week. I‚Äôm in therapy and every morning I start off with practicing gratitude and positive affirmations. Lately, it‚Äôs been incredibly difficult and yesterday morning my suicidal thoughts came in hot. They have been in and out of my mind but with emotional regulation I was able to manage them, now‚Ä¶ not so much. I cried all day yesterday and thought it was just a bad day and if I went to bed earlier, I could have a new day and feel differently. I was wrong. I keep trying to do my best to regulate myself and remind myself of a job interview coming up. My biggest question that has yet to be unanswered, does it actually get better? I tell myself and my therapist this can‚Äôt be it and there has to be more than just living in a meaningless marathon of misery. Of course, I know we all have bad day, weeks, months, years. Suffering in our life time is inevitable but I do wonder if this feeling of being unhappy and wanting to die will ever go away? If I can emotionally regulate my suicidal thoughts away and never feel like I want to hurt myself again or will I unfortunately be someone like one of my personal heroes, Robin Williams? Waking up one day in my 40s/50s, still unhappy and just end it all? I don‚Äôt really have a support system. I refer to my family as the ‚Äúworking class Roy‚Äôs‚Äù from Succession with all the narcissism and betrayal. The most I have told my few friend is that I lost my job and they haven‚Äôt really reached out to me and when I hang out with them, I don‚Äôt feel like they enjoy my company anymore. Other than my therapist and even then, her advice on ‚Äúfocus on what you can control‚Äù or ‚Äúhave you tried self-care?‚Äù Just feels insulting at this point. And let me clear it up, yes I am still doing my health coping mechanisms of reframing my thoughts, practicing gratitude and self care, daily exercise and socializing when I get the chance and above all else, believing it will help and this will pass. But the wanting to not be alive, even when I tell myself life IS worth living and trying to force myself to believe it when my material conditions don‚Äôt mirror that and I‚Äôve been stuck in the same environment for almost 30 years, will that really pass or am I just gaslighting myself?"

    "text": "I was dismissed I was dismissed I was dismissed when I opened up about being sexually assaulted. Certainly, I was a jealous, lying 11-year old. I was dismissed when I tried to escape an abusive household. Surely, I couldn't make choices for myself and a teenager can only be the cause of problems. I was dismissed when I left home. Of course, I must not have realised what it meant. I was dismissed when I showed signs of depression. Certainly, it only meant that I was finally showing my true colours. It was simply who I was. I was dismissed by a therapist. He fell asleep every time. I was dismissed by another therapist. You see, a therapist cannot do anything for you but show you the door if you start to have suicidal thoughts. I was dismissed when I opened up about my struggles. Surely, a platitude with no later check-in is enough of being a friend. I was dismissed when I shared my feelings. Obviously, I must have no idea what some people go through. People actually suffer, you know? I was dismissed when I shared my situation. 'Why do you care?' 'Why do you stress?' I was dismissed through the obvious. You see, some people end up telling you they really worried about you seeing you like *that*, but apparently they had to wait for you to get better to let you know. I was dismissed by another therapist. Certainly, I must not have been trying enough, do I even have discipline? Well, at least I was acknowledged for being 'indeed' fat. I was dismissed by a psychiatrist. The appointment never happened. I was dismissed when reaching out for professional help. The reality is that it took 8 months to find someone who wasn't even a good match, all the while dealing with suicidal thoughts. I was dismissed when I needed time to process being dismissed. You see, I was creating a bad atmosphere. I was dismissed when I questioned things. Who do I think I am? What do I know? I was dismissed when I showed concern. You see, I must have had too much time on my hands during my unemployment to imagine something was wrong. I was dismissed when I backed my concern with observations. 'Are you on your period?' I was dismissed when I looked for connection. 'You don't matter because I have broken up' I was dismissed when I offered help. Surely, nobody ever does need help. I was dismissed when I needed help to do something. 'Just do it!' I have been dismissed as we all have been in some way. I was lucky to experience it very soon in relationships that should have been safe, when I still couldn't really grasp what it meant. It certainly prepared me better for what I was going to go through. But that doesn't make any of it OK, not with anyone. Reaching out for professional help is brave, it is often what seems like a last resort. But those places are not always safe. I personally experienced only one matching safe place in therapy out of 5. This translates into a 20% chance to find a therapist that would actually be helpful. This is ridiculously low. A therapist being unhelpful, if not straight up bad is *not* a neutral situation. From a place of despair, any interaction has deep impacts. And professionals come with an authority that is hard to fight, especially when our state is fragile, when trying feels hopeless, when our thoughts already need energy to be fought. I want to believe that I've been unlucky, it would mean that things are better for others, but it seems all too common a tendency for me to truly believe that. Mental health issues are on the rise. Maybe you've been lucky, maybe you've looked down on those with such issues, but statistically, your kids, your nephews, are next. It is alarming. I am sharing those snippets of my history because while I was dismissed, you are not. You are not dismissed from playing your part in our collective responsibility to create a caring society. It starts at our level. It starts with how we interpret what we see. How do we label people who don't fit our expectations? How do we react when someone's acting differently than they used to? How do we act towards someone struggling? Do we ever push people to get a sense of satisfaction? It starts in the space between each other. Whether with colleagues, relatives, friends, strangers, lovers. What do we bring to that space? How do we nurture it? Is it shared equally? What can enter it, what can't, and why? It starts with ourselves. Are we accepting ourselves and our flaws? Are we putting our comfort first? Are we allowing connection? Vulnerability? What and who feels safe? What and who doesn't? Why? When are we defensive? When are we betraying ourselves? How is fear guiding us? What are we blocking? What are we fleeing? Are we observing our behaviours and others'? Are we aware of our impact on others and are we taking accountability and responsibility for it? Are we truly listening? Are we acting or hoping? Are we trying, are we questioning, are we learning, are we improving? Or are we dismissing, resigning, avoiding? Helping and receiving help are equally hard. Our efforts may not always matter, they may go unnoticed, get deflected and dismissed. But I think our collective power lies in trying, in refusing to give up, in keeping our light going and making it grow. With every smile, every eye contact, every small act of care, through every way we can show that we remember something about someone because we listened, that we recognise what someone did and contributed to, that we understand a situation someone is going through and how it does feel. It lies in every question that replaces judgment, it lies in acceptance replacing criticism. We're all flawed and we're never going to love everyone. But we don't have to make ourselves feel better at the expense of anyone, we don't have to bond through judgment, through the cultivation of feeling superior to anyone. We can instead start to bond because we make space for each other, because we make each other feel seen, appreciated and accepted. I am not trying to advocate for a naive and impossible vision of interpersonal relationships. But it doesn't take that much to change a dynamic. It's inviting someone to join a group, it's calling out a bully, it's sitting with someone isolated, it's backing the voice of those who speak up, it's showing understanding for those who struggle. It's a thank you, a compliment, a 'are you okay?'. What if we started to truly care for each other and show up? As James Baldwin said: everyone you're looking at is also you. But maybe you first need to see yourself fully. A ridiculous amount my 34 years, I have dealt with mental health issues. I have gone in and out of darkness more than once and reached depths many will luckily never know. Sometimes, life hangs on not much more than a feeling of guilt, a memory of kindness or new music to discover. We are fragile and our battles are unseen a lot of the time. The system is failing us and we are failing each other. It is not to say professional help is not needed and helpful, it absolutely is. If my story is common though, it is easy to not feel that way and to give up. That's why we need to step up for each other. Consider donating to a mental health charity and hugging your loved ones a little tighter. Let's do better."

    "text": "Something terrible has been triggered inside me... I recently watched the Netflix documentary Dont Fuck With Cats. For those who dont know its about catching a serial killer. The hunt started when he posted a series of videos online where he was ruthlessly killing kittens. I, 25 F, live with my partner and my 11 month old kitten. My partner has been out of town for a week. Its during this time I watched this documentary. I watched those clips and it moved me in ways I can't explain. But after that, whenever my kitten is annoying me too much with his tantrums I choke him slightly. The choking is to an extent that he starts clawing onto me for air. I feel the need to want to repeat the act more. This is beyond terrible and I have been trying to control myself. Sometimes I look at his innocent eyes and I hate myself and remind myself that I need to regain control of these horrible urges. I have severe depression, suicidal tendencies and anxiety. I was regularly hit by my mom all throughout my life untill 2022 when I ran away. Could it be related? I have also started therapy recently to battle all this. Can someone please tell me ways I can avoid this? I know I am a terrible person. I want to get better. EDIT: I understand this is very infuriating for people. I am equally appalled by myself. I spoke to my wellwishers and they will be taking care of my cat untill I am better. I am sorry to my cat for being a bad parent."

They all seem like they make sense. Idk who or what I am, idk anything. My memory feels weird and fake and I don't feel like a human being and never have. I'm bad at social interaction, I'm bad with executive function, I'm bad with sensory input, I'm bad with auditory processing. I don't know what I like, i don't stand up for myself, I'm terrified of everything new December and January were the worst depressive months of my life, I've never felt that low and disgusting before. Then, randomly, 2 weeks ago I suddenly had tons of energy and started getting 12k steps a day and working out every other day and controlling myself w my calories. But also all I can think about is losing weight!!! I can't tell if it's a hyperfixation, a manic episode, or an eating disorder because I barely have the appetite for 800 cal a day even with all the activity I've been doing, and haven't been able to sleep for longer than 6hrs a night for the past two weeks. I'm way more productive and social and forward, but I'm also way more reckless and I have noticed myself feeling violently angry when I haven't been that way since I was like 15. I'm even getting annoyed at my boyfriend for doing harmless things, which has never happened!! But I haven't been to a doctor in like 8 years and do not have insurance and I am fucking terrified of the doctor's anyway. I feel like I'm gonna do everything wrong and answer every question wrong and my doctor is gonna be a terrible person who believes people with uteruses can't feel pain and should weigh 100lbs. I feel like they're only going to say I'm fat and all of my mental issues are all in my head and I'm clearly just too lazy to handle the real world. I feel like they're going to tell me i'm pregnant or have cancer or ask to look at my genitals. I feel like they're gonna tell me I need to get needles in my flesh for one reason or another. I feel like I'm gonna have a panic attack about absolutely nothing. I feel like they're gonna say there's nothing wrong with me. Besides, I'm poor as hell and couldn't handle a full time job anyway since we're too poor for a second car (bf works full time) and I'm too afraid to drive anyway. I struggle SO hard with understanding my own emotions beyond just \"bad\" and can't easily recognize patterns in my own body and mind because it all just feels like constant random painful chaos. How am I supposed to figure out if I'm having a manic episode, and wether all the energy to fix my life that I have now just disappears on me one day, and I get fat and lazy again??? I'm so on edge and can't stop thinking and talking about politics, either, and NONE of my old hobbies hold my interest anymore. Everyone is an annoying asshole who needs to get the fuck out of my way right NOW. I feel like a crazy person with this barely controllable anger. I can't sleep or eat worth a damn!! I've slept an average of 5 hours over the last 2 weeks, never getting more than 6 1/2, and I can't eat well either. I get full to the point of nausea really quickly and so many food items are suddenly gag-inducingly repulsive even if I would not have minded before. Of course none of y'all can tell me what's wrong with me, but I don't feel like reading a list of symptoms on WebMD is gonna make me feel anything other than \"omg i have all those symptoms!!\" So if anybody by some miracle has put up with me for this long; if you have any of these disorders, do these things happen to you?"

I decided to force myself to throw up a couple of times this was my first time ever doing this, and it helped short term but hurt a bit. It went away for a bit and came back until I got home at 9:00 ish and was in my bed I was on the verge of crying and I don't know why. Please give me advice or something"

Sometimes they are caused by something, other times not. Sometimes they are instant, other times they are very gradual and dreadful descents. Some are much worse than others, but most of the time the lower moments are worse. These started a year or 2 ago, I'm almost 19 now. This has also been paired with violent depersonalization and derealization that is almost constant, as well as a concerningly low amount of self care, feeling burnt out all the time, and being unable to sleep constantly because of raging thoughts. Honestly at this point I just want some closure on what this could be. I've had my eyes on bipolar and borderline personality disorder but I'm entirely not sure."

Anyways all i remember was the light turning green and all the cars going pass the intersection. After that I don‚Äôt remember ANYTHING. I came to with my car on the other side of the road in bushes. I got out of the car and panic attack completely set in. But after everything was said and done I still have no reaction or emotion whatsoever towards the accident. And it‚Äôs been 5 days. I‚Äôm very aware when it comes to my mental health like I know for sure when something is gonna happen. And I have a feeling all the emotions from the accident will come up and I‚Äôll end up in mental breakdown mode. I have SO much anxiety cause I do not remember what happened I literally don‚Äôt understand how I don‚Äôt remember anything. I also don‚Äôt feel like myself I feel like I‚Äôm in a dream and I can‚Äôt scream to wake up. Can anyone give me advice?"

I haven't been the same since sixth grade which was fifteen years ago. It's crazy that that was a different generation yet here I am today hopeless as fuck. I survived high school and got my diploma but after that, I stopped caring. My mother has been letting me stay with her till this day. I moved out but failed and came back. I stayed with my dad last year but that didn't work either and it's a long story. Everyday I want to die and end my suffering. I regret not caving in to my urge to quit a few years ago. I just don't value anything here anymore. I don't even value myself. It's despicable and I wish that anyone reading this or anyone in general would go away and do me the favor of executing me.

Being on the Internet these days sucks. The only platforms I use are YouTube and Reddit and even then I spend way to much time on it. I do other things too like writing and drawing online but I want to stop staring at a screen. The internet sucks these days and it's all boring, YouTube is boring and Reddit is toxic. I know I'm wasting my life on a screen and I so desperately wish I could live my life to the fullest and only use it to write or draw and occasionally use social media or listen to music and only have the internet be a small part of my life, but I can't. I'm still a minor and my mom is always at work having to provide for me and my older sister barely ever wants to talk to me because she's always tried and just introverted/anti social in general. I can't go outside on my own, I'm homeschooled, and have no money or job, without the internet all I can do is draw in my sketchbook and even then, I'm in a way spending time away from reality if you really think about it. I'm tired of being stuck inside of this house and doing the same thing everyday and endlessly browsing YouTube, I want to fucking do something that I won't regret in a few years, but I literally can't. It feels like the internet is all I have and it's not real and isn't even fun anymore either. I don't know what to do.

    "text": "I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with me I‚Äôm not sure if I have some unknown mental disorder, or some sort of deficiency, or if I‚Äôm just like this. This is a horrible word vomit so not all of it makes sense. In a rough place right now. I have no motivation anymore. I don‚Äôt really enjoy things. In highschool, whenever I was suffering chronic depression, I started a lot of medications, (SSRI, SNRI, stimulants,) and at the time they saved my life, but I am not sure if maybe they fried my brain or something In highschool I used to be super driven to make art, I was super creative and had a lot of visions in my head. I‚Äôd fill up sketchbooks constantly, start difficult projects and just constantly creating with different mediums. I wrote a ton as well, and my brain was always churning with ideas and creativity, sometimes making it hard to sleep After highschool I just started losing motivation and sleeping all the time. I probably slept a whole year away. Lost an insane amount of weight from doing nothing. I can‚Äôt even really remember if I was on medication at this time or not. I think I was on anti depressants, and maybe ADHD stimulants as well. I felt happy but just preferred to sleep instead of be alive. I started working a full time job, and I didn‚Äôt really feel like the medication was doing anything for me anymore, so I just stopped taking it. I didn‚Äôt notice any withdrawals or anything either. Now, I work a full time job, go work out at the gym, go skate, hang out with friends, don‚Äôt eat unhealthily, etc. But I have no motivation to do anything on my own, ever. I don‚Äôt do laundry unless I have to clean an outfit to leave. I haven‚Äôt cleaned my room in months. I haven‚Äôt done all my laundry in years. My room literally looks like a hoarders room, it‚Äôs so bad. I don‚Äôt like to make myself food, or get gas, or get groceries. I constantly start projects and never even get halfway before abandoning them. The worst part of it is I don‚Äôt create anything hardly anymore. I rarely draw. I rarely write. It is so boring and I don‚Äôt enjoy it, I have to force myself to do it, even though I just really want to make art. I can‚Äôt see things in my head anymore, like it‚Äôs empty inside. My attention span is so terrible that I go crazy trying to focus on the project at hand for more than a couple minutes. I just sit on TikTok during any and all of my free time because it‚Äôs the only thing I have the capacity for. In the distant past I have suffered short manic episodes in which I would suddenly clean everything, start spending all my money and not be able to sleep at night for several days. Sometimes I go through bouts of paranoia where I start to think about death and get so genuinely freaked out I can‚Äôt think straight and do or say stupid things I tried weed to see if it would bring back any kind of creativity (probably a few months ago), and it hasn‚Äôt caused any problems that weren‚Äôt already there. I only indulge maybe once a week or every two weeks, to reset stress that builds up from work. Even then I don‚Äôt get fried. If I just stop taking it, nothing changes other than not getting to have a decompression hangout night. I don‚Äôt feel any smarter and my memory doesn‚Äôt get any better, and I don‚Äôt feel withdrawals or like I need it. Just a little sad I can‚Äôt turn my brain off for a couple hours. My short term memory also stresses me out, it‚Äôs really bad, but it was like that before I even looked at weed, it started getting horrible right after highschool like I said. Same with my mental cognition, I am at least 1/3rd stupider now than I was in highschool, despite only having graduated 3 years ago My mental health was the absolute worst in highschool, I‚Äôd have random psychotic breaks and anxious meltdowns, sleep for ~18+ hours, and yet I was at my most creative and constantly making art. I was as sharp as a whip and very perceptive. I would get so excited over things it would make me sick, and would always be looking forward to starting new projects and finishing old ones. I just want to create things I love again and I can‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt know where it went and I don‚Äôt know how to get it back. I‚Äôve been trying supplements and schedules and it feels like I‚Äôm just going to be like this forever. Like I‚Äôm going to keep watching myself get stupider and less creative and my motivation just completely gone in it‚Äôs entirety. Life feels really grey for me right now, like all the color has been drained from the picture. Days fly by and there isn‚Äôt anything that necessarily excites me in the ways it used to, like my brain doesn‚Äôt make those chemicals anymore. I don‚Äôt want to live like this. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs adhd or if it‚Äôs some sort of schizoaffective or autism or what, I don‚Äôt know why I started mentally declining so roughly and so quickly after highschool. Am I just growing up? Is everything boring now? Did I have some sort of stroke or do i have some sort of early onset disorder? Did the medications fry my brain? Do I need to get back on all of them to function again? Was I even functioning on them in the first place? Do I have some sort of TikTok addiction which has ruined my motivation hormones? I just want to cry and sleep forever. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with me and I don‚Äôt know how to fix it anymore, and I‚Äôve felt like that for over a year."

    "text": "Undiagnosed & Feel Like I Need to be on More Medication I have a psychiatrist but not a therapist at the moment. I‚Äôm only on Zoloft right now, dose definitely needs to be increased & maybe something else added. The Zoloft was prescribed to treat depressive episodes, paranoia, and irritability/aggression. My paranoia mostly consists of thinking people can read my mind, my partner (& sometimes other random people) is part of a conspiracy against me, & a strong distrust of people with minimal evidence. The paranoia really only hits when I‚Äôm in a depressive episode, its not necessarily my constant state of being. My primary reason for being medicated was because of angry outbursts directed at my partner for very minor non-issues (ex. fell asleep without telling me goodnight, etc) I have had visual & auditory hallucinations in the past but not at all frequently, the only full visual hallucination I had was years ago (& maybe you could consider shadowy figures/flashes halfway there) auditory hallucinations are pretty uncommon too. I used to have really bad issues with not being in control of my own thoughts (disturbing *gory or scary* images popping into my head without ability to remove it, other things that just irritated me) This is kind of just a rant, I‚Äôm undiagnosed and I feel like Zoloft just isn‚Äôt everything I need. I feel somewhat better on it I guess, but far from what I think I should feel like. If any further information is needed, ask away. I‚Äôm not asking for a diagnosis lol, I am just curious as to what my symptoms sound like to you (I won‚Äôt take it as the absolute truth or anything) &/or whether or not anyone else feels like I should be more medicated ?"

    "text": "i want to send this to her so bad. obviously I know it‚Äôs wrong Thank you - seriously, even if it sounds sarcastic. For the longest time I‚Äôve kept up delusions of my ‚Äú‚Äùlife‚Äù‚Äù having any worth, or of there being any chance of me becoming an actual human being. Now that I was in residential for the longest time, and for past 2 months have been in yet another albeit less intense mental health program far away from ‚Äúhome‚Äù or my real home college, I realize fully that those things aren‚Äôt true. But the process of realizing that true thing didn‚Äôt begin with treatment. I know that you said that you said weren‚Äôt proud of how you handled the situation (as if I somehow deserved any sort of apologies or respect). But, and I mean this genuinely and appreciatively, it was inadvertently a huge factor in helping me understand that not only am I NOT an actual fucking HUMAN being like EVERY SINGLE OTHER PERSON ‚ÄúMY AGE‚Äù AND ESPECIALLY IN COLLEGE (even if I‚Äôm still not back there), but that at this point there is absolutely no chance of me becoming one at this point in my life ‚Äú‚Äù‚Äù‚Äùlife‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù, in terms of undoing past damage. So even if for whatever bizarre reason you thought that a thing like ‚Äúme‚Äù was somehow entitled to an apology (I‚Äôm not) as opposed to anything other than expressions of disgust on yours or anyone‚Äôs part, the prior mess was still actually productive for me. I remember you telling me in your last message that you understood the way I felt, and had once been in a similar position yourself. I‚Äôm not sure if you meant just in terms of harming my‚Äùself‚Äù, or more broadly the experience of spending part of one‚Äôs life not growing up like a normal human being and than being lost when in the world, but I feel like you meant the latter. And that was one of the most important things. In conjunction with what you told me about your own history with harm, I saw that even if you at one time had lived a life where you were not human, you must have turned everything around WHILE THAT WINDOW WAS STILL OPEN, and still were a person by the time you STARTED COLLEGE at least. So, thank you for once again inadvertently helping me let go of another delusion about ‚Äúme‚Äù changing. I now recognize that at this point in my ‚Äú‚Äùlife‚Äù‚Äù, I‚Äôm too much of a mentally ill, sheltered freak to ever become a human as well, and that there‚Äôs no time, or point, anymore. Sadly after some previous nights spent staring down bottles of pills I ultimately still seem to lack the courage to fucking kill myself like I need to (even though logically I understand that‚Äôs what I should do, I doubt I ever will, especially since I put all of that effort into my appearance, which working on makes me feel better than anything else in the world) but I‚Äôm really appreciative that this situation helped me realize just how fucking WEAK and EMPTY and HELPLESS I am. And more than ANYTHING how HOLLOW I am, completely devoid of normal HUMAN MEMORIES of having fun and also suffering and discovering one‚Äôs self and growing with other HUMANS. What‚Äôs even more sad is that several days ago I was forced to be on a mood stabilizer. So as that kicks it will probably steal the depth and intensity of my emotions of which I am so proud, probably the only thing I can say that about. Already it‚Äôs more difficult to imagine myself being really moved by, say, a piece of music, or having these beautiful sobbing fits at night thinking about all that was stolen from me. And even if this med don‚Äôt make me feel outright horrendous like my previous concoction of 3 pills I was on until somewhat over a year prior, I predict that such ‚Äústability‚Äù will cause me to maybe believe these false delusional ideas about ‚Äúchanging‚Äù, or even worse make me okay with not being human. Obviously I understand fully that this is wrong and inappropriate to send. In fact I understood that about the email I sent in early September, too. When I sent an apology the next night, I claimed that I was hanging on to a false hope about friendship, because that was easier to explain then the fact that I knew it was wrong but lacked sufficient mental stability and self control to not compulsively broadcast my suffering. That I‚Äôm doing that again just PROVES how FUCKING CRAZY and UNWORTHY of INTERACTING WITH HUMANS ‚ÄúI‚Äù am. And more than anything I‚Äôm just so tired of being me that I can‚Äôt even think of what‚Äôs wrong anymore. Plus my true feelings need to go out NOW before the meds kick in and I begin to believe aforementioned false things anyway. Again: even if not intentionally, I‚Äôm really glad that I was able to experience something that helped me stop being delusional about ‚Äúchanging‚Äù. And, considering my outward freakishness and pattern of behavior, I‚Äôd hope that you‚Äôd be even one percent as disgusted by me as I am by myself, because I believe that‚Äôs the sensible attitude towards ‚Äúme‚Äù. My plan was to go back to school in August. As much of what remains of delusional part of me wants that to happen and still believes that things will turn around, I hope that by point that for one reason or another won‚Äôt occur; least of all so that I can‚Äôt be a THREAT to all the actual HUMANS that I meet! Signed, A HOLLOW, *exceedingly* effeminate, hopelessly awkward, sheltered, unintelligent, neurodivergent, FAT (21.8, up from 20.4 a year ago), hopeless excuse for a man, let alone a ‚Äú‚Äù‚Äù‚Äùperson‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù"

I‚Äôve just recently told them about my violent thoughts and when I did they ended up calling a crisis center and wanted me to go there. I said I didn‚Äôt want to go and that I wasn‚Äôt gonna do anything but they were extremely insistent on me going. When I finally convinced them I wasn‚Äôt gonna do anything, I went home without seeing the crisis team. Im thinking about stopping going to that mental health clinic because that day was so horrible. I literally didn‚Äôt want say anything about these thoughts at first because I was scared of being seen as a monster and it felt like they seen me as a monster. I felt like crying while in that clinic because I felt so ill. Im most likely gonna stop getting treatment as a whole because im feeling extremely hopeless right now and that I‚Äôll never be able to get the help I need. Also they have prescribed me anti depressants, I haven‚Äôt picked them up yet but say if I do stop going to that clinic and but the medication end up helping, would there be any way for me to get refills on the meds?"

I have been dealing with fear of developing schizophrenia, schizoaffective psychosis, delusion & hallucination since i was 27. I have been to different psychiatrist and I was on and off with Escitalopram 10mg. Right now it is my third time retaking escitalopram after long period being stopping medication. It‚Äôs my second day restarting it and I‚Äôm not happy and feel so much panic and anxiety. I know posting here on reddit may not be a good idea but I really want to vent out. My major concern is the loud intrusive thought that sounds more like mind chatter and mental images/scenarios in my head whenever I tried to sleep and during a severe anxiety episode. I always get these whenever I close my eyes and it usually stops the moment I open my eyes. Usually it doesn‚Äôt bother me esp when I‚Äôm really tired but when I have heighten anxiety and panic episode. It caused me so much distressed and anxiety. The voices that i have in my head are like internal chatters that says random words or phrases. Most of the time they sound familiar and it sometimes accompanied by vivid images. The way I would describe it is like watching a video playing in your head. It‚Äôs like dreaming while your still fully awake. Other times, I hear song loop usually chorus. I‚Äôd also hear my name being called. Sometimes it was a faint scream or yell when I‚Äôm about to sleep/have shallow sleep and when I was awaken by panic attack. Sometimes the images are disturbing that I refused to sleep because it cause me so much distress cos I feel like I am schizophrenic and experiencing psychosis. I read article, tiktok video and post about people experiencing internal auditory hallucination and closed-eyed hallucination very similar to my own. And they it is a symptoms of schizophrenia now my mind is convince that I have it. I feel like sinking. There are times when I am constantly thinking about my symptoms almost 24/7 that I trigger my anxiety and I started having disorganized word salad train of thoughts where my mind would send me gibberish thoughts/words that doesn‚Äôt make sense and it would caused me so much distress. And whether I happen to think or imagine positive/negative scenarios my mind would automatically think it‚Äôs delusion.. I keep constantly asking myself what if I start believing in my thoughts. What if i experience delusions? What if I start having psychosis. What if my meds don‚Äôt work anymore. When I read about symptoms of schizophrenia or psychosis being not able to process a thought or having different thought that doesn‚Äôt make sense it sent me into a downward spiral. I have become so fearful and scared of almost everything. I get scared when I get intrusive thoughts. I get scared when I stutter or paused when I speak. I get scared when I get mental block or forget things. I get scared when I had typo when I text. When I watch a video about prodromal psychosis or read about it, my mind think i have it. And not just that. I‚Äôd even feel the sensations and symptoms starts showing up. I have become hyperaware and sensitive with what i hear. Even the tiniest noise. With what i see that I need to double check. Lately even I become sensitive to smell that when I smell something bad even the slightest my mind would question whether I am the other one who can smell it. When I hear even the fainting noise, I‚Äôd try to look for the source. Sometimes I get scared looking or watching videos because I was scared I might start believing it. I have been avoiding messaging my friends because I‚Äôm scared I might send them crazy stuff. Sometimes I get scared being out in public bcos I kept thinking what if I start acting crazy. Heck I even got scared looking at posters and billboard even though it‚Äôs not scary. I feel like I am experiencing paranoia. I can‚Äôt sleep cos I can‚Äôt stop thinking about it. From the moment I wake up to the time I go to sleep. I honestly thinking rather die than to experience psychosis delusion or go insane. It‚Äôs really hard living like this. I forgot who I used to be before my anxiety."

And I end up believing that I have this certain thing, and i spend so much of my time researching and understanding it. Others, like my girlfriend believe it's OCD, as i do have a history with that and my symptoms line up, i used to believe i was a pedophile because i got horrible intrusive thoughts that gave me panic attacks. i also do a lot if weird behavior in relation to contamination; like i blow on a can if its left open too long because i think its filed with dust and blowing on it will get rid of it, i also rinse every piece of cutlery before i use it to get rid of the dirt or dust it has, even if its just been washed (i have to do that one or else i will panic), and other things that will take too long to describe. I've been like this for most of my life from what i can remember. sometimes i think i have like schizophrenia or BPD, or something like that and i become so sure of it, but then i think what if i'm doing it for attention, what if i'm not actually crazy, and i have nothing wrong with me and just making this up. What if i'm delusional? i don't know what to think, or what is real about me, i feel so disconnected from everyone and everything and i feel like i'm the only person like this. i feel like i'm making myself ill on purpose, destroying myself, sabotaging myself, and i don't know why."

I grew up with a bipolar mother and knew how it would be, i had insight. I continued to go and to therapy (plus hospitalizations) and whatnot until i was 17 then stopped because it felt like a waste of time. I started back going when i was 19 and started talking to someone new and was diagnosed with PTSD which had been a discussion before ( i never stayed in one place long enough) but again I knew that BUT was okay with it. I once again fell into the pattern of stopping and going back until last year i gave it one more shot and was told during my last session that my new diagnosis would most likely be borderline personality disorder and honestly it scared me. I stopped going again. It felt wrong and it scared the living shit out of me because i never heard any good things about it and from hearing ppl talk, they called anyone with bpd crazy and i didn't want to be that. i heard it enough growing up and continue to hear it because still, i am struggling and i desperately want to get help because i feel like i'm constantly falling apart but still i'm scared to received that diagnosis. I want to feel better, even if it's a little. i just want to feel.. normal? again. I'm stuck in this weird cycle of wanting to be diagnosed so i can get better but at the same time i'm scared that i will be handed that card. i don't know much about bpd so i don't even know if it's possible to get better so what i'm asking is, how did you come to terms with it? is there good treatment options? is it even worth getting the diagnosis? or am i just screwed?"

Occassional genuine thoughts every now and then, with most times just being a cry for help from my psyche. In recent months it's gotten exceptionally bad. Vivid, violent hallucinations paired with dark dark thoughts. Very frequently those dark thoughts lead me to realize I have literally no one to reach out to and in the moment I feel like I have no options for moving forward in life. So, the thought of ending it increasingly becomes more and more of a valid solution in those dark times these days. But, no one seems to notice. People have said I actually seem like I'm getting a lot better after a really bad breakup. Some people have even complemented me on how well I'm doing in life.

Like I can't imagine ever really connecting on an emotional level or sharing all my secrets with someone without it feeling idk shallow? Wrong? Like I don't feel a deep enough connection with anyone to rlly explain all my real emotions to anyone. If it helps I do struggle with empathy sometimes and am pretty apathetic for most people. Although I never show this and am I always the supportive friend you can vent to if you want. Maybe I just don't see others as people enough? When I view people I usually just see a few lists with all their different good and bad qualities on it. Is this normal can yall relate? Also do yall have any way to fix this? Thanks üôè"

    "text": "Electroconvulsive Therapy - Opinions or Thoughts? Hey folks, So, im very open about the fact I struggle with treatment resistant depression, PTSD, BPD, and ADHD. I have tried every antidepressant (first generation, SSRIs, SNRIs, atypical/off-label), typical and atypical antipsychotics, and some mood stabilizers as well as cognitive behavioural therapy, dialectical behaviour therapy, cognitive processing therapy, EMDR, emotion focused therapy, existential/eclectic/psychodynamic therapy, internal family systems therapy, and somatic/hypnotic therapy. I have even tried third-line depression options like IV ketamine therapy and unilateral (one side/temple) ECT (electroconvulsive therapy). Right now im being recommended ECT again, however it would be bilateral (both sides/temples) this time, which tends to be a lot more effective but also have a lot more side effects. *side note: to those who aren‚Äôt aware, yes, ECT is still something performed today. It is nothing like it used to be back in the 60s or how it‚Äôs shown in the movies. You get put to sleep, given a paralytic so you don‚Äôt experience muscle contractions, and then a low electric current is passed through your brain to trigger a controlled, therapeutic seizure. You do not experience any pain other than possibly a headache and the entire procedure + anesthesia lasts maybe ten minutes. It is a very safe procedure* The active phase of the procedure is getting ECT three times a week Monday, Wednesday, and Friday for a minimum of four weeks. Once the active phase is completed you move on to the weekly maintenance phase and slowly decrease the frequency of treatment. Anyway, the efficacy for this treatment is 60%-80%, which compared to other treatments for mental disorders is considered very high. I only noticed mild benefit with unilateral ECT (this is often the case, most people end up needing bilateral ECT but they try the unilateral first for those who only end up needing that one side for full benefit and that way reduce the possibility and intensity of side effects). I‚Äôd also like to reiterate just how much ‚Äúthis is my last option‚Äù. I have tried everything, I mean literally everything that can be tried for depression AND then some. However, the side effects of bilateral ECT can be pretty intense. I was lucky to only experience headaches when I did unilateral but I was promised I would not be so lucky with bilateral. The biggest, most common, most intense symptom is memory loss. It can be pretty severe, lots of people report having blackouts where they lose memory of several hours of the day and just randomly ‚Äúgain consciousness‚Äù in the middle of nowhere or performing a random activity hours later. You experience significant cognitive decline (like they make you do typical Alzheimer‚Äôs diagnostic tests to monitor the rate of your decline). The bright side is that permanent memory loss and cognitive decline is uncommon, it usually only lasts during the active phase of your treatment and maybe early into your maintenance phase too. Does anyone have any advice or even just their personal opinion on what they would do?"

    "text": "Absent mindedly prepared for self harm - don‚Äôt know what to do So I wanted to start this by saying I‚Äôve been clean from c//tting as a self harm tool for years now, I don‚Äôt know the exact time frame and quite frankly I‚Äôm not bothered about that but the point is I haven‚Äôt c//t myself for years. I stopped because my parents found out and I couldn‚Äôt bare to see them see more fresh scars so I stopped out of fear and then I‚Äôve not touched a blade in that way, minus the brief period of relapse shortly after without visible scars on my leg. I‚Äôm scared, because usually when I‚Äôve had thoughts of c//tting myself they‚Äôve been momentary, I know they‚Äôll pass, just the urge gets strong. Except the urge isn‚Äôt strong right now in this period of time, it‚Äôs come up a few times right before panic attacks but the planning, the made up scenarios of what would happen if I do do it have happened. Like intrusive thoughts except‚Ä¶ I lean into them. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm mentally preparing myself to get worse and need this tool again. Because the truth is, my mental health is shit again, the shittiest it has been since school, I opened up something inside of me and suddenly all this repressed anxiety has just made its way to the top and I don‚Äôt know what to do except actually deal with it because I can‚Äôt suppress it again, I want to get better. I‚Äôm receiving therapy so I CAN get better. People at my work know about my anxiety right now, I‚Äôve been trying to tell as many people as I can about my mental health so that they can support me so that it‚Äôs easier to look after myself. Even the store manager knows right now (she‚Äôs been super supportive and I really trust her). But fuck can they find out about these thoughts. There‚Äôs only one person I‚Äôd potentially trust with this information because she‚Äôs young but old enough that she‚Äôs more recovered from her anxiety, but I don‚Äôt want to worry her with this information and she is a supervisor despite the fact she‚Äôs very friendly with me and I worry that even mentioning something like this to her she‚Äôd have the duty to report it. I worry people will think I‚Äôm a danger to myself but right now I‚Äôm not, that‚Äôs the thing, I‚Äôm just growing increasingly worried that it‚Äôll only be a matter of time until I will be. How much anxiety and pain and suffering do I have to endure again to feel like I need to relapse to cope? Because everything is getting more serious, what was just more panic attacks and more anxiety has mentally drained me over the past few weeks and made me more actively process the trauma I‚Äôve been through because ultimately, that is the root reason as to why I‚Äôm doing this shit right now. I‚Äôm scared though. I keep saying these are just thoughts and it doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôll do anything but I have a blade in my bag. It‚Äôs from my past job, a box cutter, I need to get rid of it but idk how and where. And this is so stupid of me but I just picked it up and looked at it and I pressed my finger on the blade part and then really pressed down just to see how easily it COULD cut, and yes it‚Äôs very blunt but I figured with enough force and pressure it could do harm. I don‚Äôt know why I did it, I didn‚Äôt draw blood on my finger cause it wasn‚Äôt the attempt of self harm it was just seeing how easy or hard it would be to use and now I feel like an idiot and more of a danger to myself than I was because why would I absent mindedly do something like that? If I do that with barely any thought then what‚Äôs stopping me from making the first mark again? Then what? My partner doesn‚Äôt even know I‚Äôve had these thoughts and considerations, they‚Äôve heard when I‚Äôve had urges but nothing this serious because they know about my anxiety and if they know I‚Äôve had these thoughts it‚Äôll break them. I‚Äôm seeing them tomorrow and staying over theirs for a few nights and I don‚Äôt know what to do because what if I have these thoughts there? I don‚Äôt know how to tell them that I might not be able to keep myself safe come a few more weeks when I might have had enough‚Ä¶"

But for the past couple of years it has made its own dark effects. Sometimes, when i look at my hands my mind tell me this is not how they're supposed to look. It makes me slit my wrists trying to get the blood out of me. Recently the same thing started to happen with faces around me. I look at someone and it hits me that this is not how one should look. I look at my skin and it feels unfamiliar. But its so pretty! Im usually cheerfull, but i have periods where i get very depressed for months, start having suicidal thoughts. Its like there is no in-between. About 90% of the time there are intrusive thoughts in my mind, telling me to just kill myself. I've made it a game - i gave those thoughts bodies, theyre dark blue and green hedgehogs. I pretend that its their job to tell me to kill myself, so i can usually brush them kff pretty easy, by locking them up in their cages. Its all in my mind anyway. There is also a ghost in my room who wants to kill me. Ive made friends with her. She still hates me. I don't care. My walls are lovers. I feel like im mad, but when i try to tell someone they don't believe me. I feel like im high most of the time despite being clean. Maybe i just have wild imagination. Its not always funny. I don't know what to do. Yesterday i had a chat with random person on the bus about the matrix. He was one of those people who talk to themselves in public. We became friends, i think. We were both the same. Today the classroom was shaking and no one else seemed to notice. Everything is spinning. It has been spinning a lot for the past months. I tried to admit myself to an asylum but they need parental permission. Also in my country the asylums look like they're frim a horror movie. They're so pretty! Some days i feel like im on the verge of completely losing it. Other days i try to get a break from living by just existing. So really, am i crazy? What do i do? I've tried to attempt once when the depression got me good, but realised i couldn't do it. The voices don't bother me much but there are some moments. Makes me a danger to myself. Ps. I know this sounds like a fanfic written by a 12 years old. Im sorry. I also apologise for any errors."

This started in about 7th grade and became a bigger problem after I moved in with my mom's boyfriend who constantly yells and targets me for not reason. I don't know why this is happening to me, I don't feel human anymore. I want to be normal."

About a month in I started having tons of symptoms and thoughts I figured were due to an SSRI change (i eventually went back to my original med/dose) however, it has remained quite bad since. Thoughts include: -I don‚Äôt actually like my partner, I just like the feeling of being wanted -I have crushes on other people, including my partners friends who I barely know -I don‚Äôt feel butterflies so I must be losing feelings for him -I think he‚Äôs ugly/im just not attracted to him -I‚Äôm secretly a lesbian and I‚Äôm wasting his time by being with him -a general feeling of dread, wrongness, or needing out of the relationship -not being able to believe him when he reassures me about everything -all of the above is just my genuine feelings and I‚Äôm using ocd as an excuse These are obviously crazy things to think, however one of my biggest compulsions is confession and self sabotage so I have told my partner all of these things in detail. He‚Äôs really great and patient about all of it but I can tell it weighs on him. Hes even recently expressed feeling like it‚Äôs his fault and that he wonders if it wouldn‚Äôt be this bad if I was with someone else. I feel so miserable but i feel like I‚Äôd be miserable in any relationship but im scared that‚Äôs not the truth and my ocd isn‚Äôt real. When it‚Äôs good i feel the most romantic love for him I‚Äôve ever felt toward anyone ever. He‚Äôs an incredible person but I just feel so alone and lost on what to do.

All the meds I've taken (Adderall 10mg, Vyvanse 10mg, Lexapro 5mg/7.5mg, Concerta 27/36mg) have caused me to have these 'episodes' where I deal with intrusive delusional thoughts and unstable mood swings. Concerta 18mg was actually nice in the sense it gave me a high, but I wasn't productive on it. Hydroxyzine 10-20mg helps me calm down at least. I tried Olanzapine 2.5mg yesterday, and my mind isn't in turmoil anymore. It's a relief that I feel calm and normal for once. This feels like a good thing, but I started reading other people's experiences on reddit/drugs.com. Their withdrawal symptoms are scary, and it seems like it can cause permanent severe insomnia (along with brain shrinkage in some studies?). It seems this can also happen with just a few weeks usage. My psychiatrist didn't tell me this, he just said olanzapine was going to be a nervous system regulator for me at night. I'm thinking that I definitely don't want to take it for two weeks consistently (before our next appt). I would rather take Seroquel if it seems like antipsychotics would truly help me. My friend has been on it for 7 years, and it seems like its side effects are much better. I was wondering if anyone here has similar experiences in their life journey, or has used olanzapine before? And what you're diagnosed with. Thank you!"

I can‚Äôt go on a date with a guy without me fearing him leaving if he goes to the bathroom. God forbid a guy shows up late too bc ill imagine that they‚Äôre blowing me off. It‚Äôs constant, it‚Äôs everyday, it‚Äôs only with men I want or have a relationship with. It seems like no matter how hard I try this is something I just can‚Äôt change. Also this guy I like a lot rn had to go to to his car to get something and I literally panicked the whole time he left, even tho he literally left all his belongings inside. It‚Äôs irrational and makes no sense. I fear being left so much and I just want to move on with my life!!!!!"

ASPD is very clearly characterized by lacking emotions but BPD is known to be emotionally burned (sensitive more than normal) so how in the hell can these two exist together in a coherant human being who's actually somewhat loved and somewhat productive in society. Edit: I forgot to actually request the research if it even exists, I tried using Google scholar but I couldn't find many that talk about BPD and ASPD co-occuring and there was a severe lack of it occurring in women, so help a girly out if you know any good books/research/podcasts that talk about this?

My suicidal thoughts are general. I really don‚Äôt have a ‚Äúreason‚Äù. The stress in my life is fairly light. I‚Äôve worked hard to simplify my life and reduce my stress. I‚Äôve developed coping skills to deal with the bad stuff and great boundaries professionally and in my relationships to deal with my people pleasing. I do have an amazing support system and I am blessed with loved ones I can always count on. My suicidal thoughts are intrusive with absolutely no meaning or reasoning. My brain just tells me that I shouldn‚Äôt be here. When the er doc asked me what‚Äôs causing my thoughts I tell him that I don‚Äôt know. He‚Äôs surprised. He continues and asks why I want to die. Again, I say I don‚Äôt know, my brain just tells me this. He CHUCKLES and said you don‚Äôt have a reason? Are you stressed? Is work hard? Having trouble with money or relationships? Again I say, I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm thinking this, and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm in the ER. I think he caught himself and goes into the whole talk about self care and balance and having hobbies to help your mental health. I guess I wasn‚Äôt distressed enough and my bloodwork was fine: they gave me something for my headache and an Ativan, plus I had a nap and they released me and told me to follow up with a psych appointment. Now I‚Äôm sitting here a little calmer due to the Ativan but upset at the afternoon I spent in the er with no real help and the bill I‚Äôll soon be getting.

Friends parents who's couch I was sleeping in kicked me out at 14 and I was homeless between 14-16 discovered as a homeless youth and adopted again on my 17th birthday to be kicked out at 18 with very little contact. I'm now in my countries military and find socializing extremely difficult and caring about others even more difficult. I want to be able to have friendships and genuine connections and be able to work well with others. Every single slight social interaction scares the hell out of me unless I'm beyond drunk. I know I'm very smart but if you tried having a conversation with me you would be very convinced I'm dumb as a rock. I'm not sure if I should seek therapy or if I just need to grow up and get my shit together or both idk. I want your thoughts. Also when I do make friends and make an effort to socialize I always end up in a situation where I feel like having friends is draining and I'd rather just be alone all the time but now that I'm in the military, I don't have the luxury of working a job where I don't have the interact with many people so I know I need to figure something out but idk how."

I would love any input or advice you have! 1. Do you have to have been hospitalized due to mental illness? 2. Can you be approved if you have a lengthy employment history? 3. How many times were you denied before you got approved? 4. What is the approval process like? I am a 45f and have been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder, Bipolar Type 2, GAD, and Fibromyalgia. I have never been arrested, never been to jail, and never hospitalized. I have almost always had a job and almost always had my own apartment and my own vehicle. However... I can barely take care of myself. I have not showered in over a year. I do not cook, clean, do laundry, go grocery shopping or into any store for that matter. I am extremely lucky that I found my partner of 12 years and he does not hold this against me. Before I met him, I had slept with well over 150 people, male and female. I am scared to death of being alone. I have been to college 4 times and I have dropped out 4 times. I have had 27 different jobs, ranging from 1 day to 4 years. I have been fired at least 10 times. I have always had trouble with attendance and have signed many attendance contracts. Even though I have usually had my own place, I have moved 23 different times since turning 19. I would usually only stay long enough that the place got so dirty I couldn't stand it. So instead of cleaning, I would just move (unless I was kicked out for being late on rent, which also happened several times). The only reason I have never been homeless or hospitalized is because I have supportive family members. I have isolated myself so much that I no longer have any friends. The only person I talk to aside from my partner is my mom. Even though my partner does not have a drivers license (but I do), he is the only one that drives because I have too much anxiety behind the wheel. Over the last 10 years, I have been working from home because I have a hard time getting ready every day and being around people. Before getting laid off this last Sept, I have only been working part time. I've been unemployed for 5 months and I only have 3 weeks left of unemployment benefits. I'm having a really hard time finding a new job and my mental and physical health have greatly deteriorated. I know that most people are denied disability the first time they apply. How many times were you denied and what all did you have to do to get approved?"

The upper half of my brain feels really light and fuzzy, like theres nothing there. I don't have an inner dialog, so there's never clear words, except when I'm reading. Reading helps because it takes my brain to a different place, and tells it how it should feel. Music also helps because it gives my brain an emotion to fixate on. Without music or books, the only emotions I feel strongly are frustration, upset, and stress. I mean, my brain vaguely tells me what I should be feeling, but I don't actually feel it. It's really easy to zone out during these times, a lot of the time I forget to do something. Sorry if this is a mess, I just want to know if anyone else feels like this sometimes."

I feel like our lives are glimpses of thoughts of this space-time entity (this universe) and our glimpses of thoughts creating new creatures in lower dimension(that already existsü§£)(lower doesn‚Äôt mean inferior). Then our lives should be the universe(new space-time entity)(that already exists) for them. Also this universe is a glimpse of thought of something in the higher dimension(higher doesn‚Äôt mean superior) and so on. Its eternal in every directions. So I‚Äôm posting what already existsüêí"

    "text": "What do I do I‚Äôm so defeated feeling this morning. My partner (31m) has had a rough past few years. He was an alcoholic for a few years while in the military. We had a child together and he was only getting worse so we separated for about three years. I had hoped he would use that time to reflect and figure himself out while he had fewer responsibilities. He stopped drinking after two DUIs but was still very obviously depressed and kept losing jobs. He told me he was probably going to be homeless and sounded so hopeless that I asked him to move back in with us as long as he kept not drinking and got into therapy. It took him over 6 months but he got into therapy and has been doing minor housework and being home to take our kid to and from school. Well a little bit ago he was doing some electrical work around the house and we started talking about him getting into that field of work like an apprenticeship. He liked the idea and did the testing and had an interview scheduled for this morning. But last night got very emotional about the idea of going down this road and said he actually wanted to do something else. I said okay we‚Äôll call around tomorrow after the interview and see about getting into that field instead. But you should still see the interview through in case being there and hearing more makes you feel better about it. I sent him a good luck text this morning and he replied saying he was sorry but he couldn‚Äôt go to the interview. I know this probably has a lot to do with his anxiety and depression but I‚Äôm feeling like he‚Äôs never going to get back out into the world. Financially because of my job we‚Äôre okay, but just making it with not much leftover for savings or emergency. Idk if I want advice or just to vent but there‚Äôs my story. Feel free to share whatever comes to mind."

When I close my eyes I see very disturbing images of past patients when they died. my job is the only thing that gets me out of bed because it gives me a sense of meaning and my job makes me happy. quitting is not an option. my mental health has caused me to lose so many friends because im not a very stable friend, I am a very good one but I know im hard to be around."

    "text": "Does the inability to achieve 100% certainty or clarity spiral you into distress? Hi everyone, I've been struggling with this constant need for certainty and clarity in my life, especially when it comes to personal thoughts and perceptions. It feels like no matter how much I try to be sure of something, there's always doubt lingering. What really throws me off is that I can't seem to escape the feeling that *even people who are not mentally sound* can be convinced of their own clarity or normalcy. For example, the idea that *stupid* people never question their own intelligence, or that *crazy* people truly believe they are normal, can send me spiraling into self-doubt. I grew up with a mother who had schizophrenia, and she was completely convinced of her delusions, which was extremely unsettling. I often find myself trapped in this paradox: how can we ever be certain of anything, when even those who are mentally unwell believe they are right? Does anyone else experience this kind of thinking? How do you cope with the fact that it's impossible to be 100% certain about everything? Does the ambiguity cause you a sense of deep distress, or do you find ways to tolerate it?"

It is noy anhedonia (or is it) , it doesn't say it's a lack of pleasure. It is not depression, it doesn't they feel sad, just bored and dissatified. It's just apathy and lack of interest. Here's something else that seems similiar. Yes, I realize it's from a fantasy game, but could it exist in real life. *In addition, the tones of the Organ, no matter how badly set or played, are of unearthly beauty. Whenever it is played, all hearing it (including the organist) must roll a successful saving throw vs. spell or be enchanted forever.Those so stricken cannot abide any other sound. Deprived of its tones, they despair and see no wonder or greatness (in either good or evil) in the world. Gradually, those enchanted take less and less interest in life until they finally reach the point where even the finest food is an anathema to them.

    "text": "I don't know how to perceive my mom When I was younger, especially in my early childhood, my mom was incredibly mean to me. It quickly escalated to physical and emotional abuse. We had these screaming matches which ended up in beatings. I genuinely think I forgot most of it but these memories are coming back to me after years. The thing is that when I was around ten the physical aspect of the abuse stopped, she was still pretty abusive emotionally, but even that changed when she went to psychiatrist. She is very nice now and I love her a lot. I think I even forgot about everything that happened to me when it was just us living together. When I was around fourteen I ruined family dinner when I brought up the beatings as a joke. I remember her locking herself in the bathroom and crying. At the end I did receive the small apology for it but... I don't know. I know she blames herself for how severely mentally ill I am, but she never did anything to actually change or confront her own trauma which her own mom inflicted on her and genuinely still does to this day. All she did was get onto antidepressants. She lives in the different country and doesn't even call me, I am the one who needs to initiate the calls. It's just so weird, because yes, she changed she is so caring and loving, the abuse has stopped but there are still these moments which remind me of her being horrible to me, being the same person she was from years ago. How should I treat her? It would be weird if I just bring it all up unprompted, especially after like years of peace and love. But the memories and these small moments genuinely crush me."

My bf is loyal, confident, affectionate, fun person. He would never do anything to harm me, respects me, wouldn't push for anything physical which I'm not comfortable with and he also wants to be in a committed relationship. The problem is I have gone through some issues in my life and some ongoing, I have OCD, PMDD gone through some surgeries for my uterus and have painful periods cramps. My bf on the other hand has had a easier life and he doesn't really do well in stressful situations, a small thing like minor fight with a random person in street would make his mood godown and small physical injuries also would hurt him a lot. Even in our relationship, if we fight or have an argument he can't really handle it and he says it's fucks his mood up and he's sensitive like that. He wants to have a lots of fun and would avoid anything that's uncomfortable or stressful even at the slightest. He has himself said he is not emotionally mature. He also has listening problems like he won't listen fully to you and would often cut you off even though he has worked on that problem and has come so far for me. I mask my mental health struggle so well and I often felt alone and unheard in this relationship and I asked him to check up on me now and then and he does that and he tells me I can talk to him and open up but the times I did I never felt understood and I feel like he's doing it just bc I have asked him to. The main problem here for me is, if he has not faced any life challenge and trust me I come with challenges like mental ups and downs and physical struggles I need some support, how will he be there for me when I need him? I need an emotionally mature, understanding and listening man to be with so he can see that I'm struggling and is there for me. I don't know how long I can mask and look like that fun happy person which I'm not that often"

I've been that person who people worry about, the one who struggles. I'm lucky that busting my ass in counseling was something I could do and that helped. I'm lucky that I had a great doctor to check in with every quarter, lucky to have her behind me while I got my medication sorted. I just don't know how much my friend \"N\" is capable of making positive changes in her life, and I don't know how to be friends with someone who can't, in so many ways, stop needing so much and ever get \"better\". Met N (39, NB, I will use different pronouns since she does) about 4.5 years ago or something like that when they were dating someone I know. Moved in fairly quickly because N was living an hour and half away. While N and I were taking a class together, they started to open up big time about their relationship problems. This went on 8 months, hours and hours of talking, until the break up. N stayed with some friends of ours after moving out while she was looking for a new place. Was supposed to be there a month, was there over 3. My friends were expecting a baby at the time and couldn't decorate their nursery because she was in the space. After the break up, there was one big instance of her snapping at me about \"staying friends\" with her ex because I wouldn't stop going to a bimonthly event where he was on the same team as me, nor would I commit to trying to get him kicked out. This was literally the only place I saw him or spoke to him, make 4 hours a month. N was in a good place regarding the ex until after entering a \"relationship sobriety\" 12 step. Suddenly, N went from staying she was fine with possibly attending events where he was soon, to not being able to even attend events he was invited to, needing to check with her sponsor about everything, and resentful of people who \"invited\" him places by sending out invites to an established large group text. They asked me to double check he wasn't going to be at a Christmas party, which I did if not enthusiastically, then bitched to a friend that they hadn't felt supported because I hadn't gushed while doing it I guess. There's a lot I will have to leave out, but N is hyper focused on being social to the detriment of her well being. When she finally rests, she stays in bed until 1:00 PM or 2:00 PM. Their apartment is disgusting half the time, and I don't think their dog is always getting the proper attention. N recently called me at 1:00 AM saying her bipolar symptoms were severe and I told her to go to the hospital and let me know she was there. She did, then dropped off the face of the earth so I had to call around to hospitals to find her. Thankfully they were fine and went home at lunch time. The next day, N asks me if I can watch her dog the following Saturday night so she can go to a party after her second job. I say no, and am secretly fuming. Why is this person not at all focused on counseling or resting or anything to get well when they were just in the hospital with a mental health crisis the night before? Another friend tells me that N didn't get admitted because she couldn't miss work. I had off work randomly the next Tuesday and ran into her. Said they had taken off for a mental health day. Great, we should all do that. But why is that suddenly possible when the week before when they were in the hospital with doctors who could help them, it wasn't possible? Recently, a friend had a birthday party and we all agreed to specifically have it on a Sunday and not Saturday because of N's work schedule and picked one around the friend's birthday. N committed to being there, then a few days later, remembered there was an improv event they wanted to go to on that day. She actually asked if it was possible to reschedule for the upcoming Sunday 3 days away. She asked someone else to reschedule a birthday because there was something else she wanted to do. They asked 4 other people to change their schedules to fit what they wanted to do. Birthday girl explains the reservation is paid for and N still decides to go to the imrpov bullshit and cost our friend the money paid for the reservation. Now, N offered to pay the birthday girl back, but come on. The improv thing was totally a choice and after all picked this day especially in consideration of her, and she knew a reservation had been made and paid for, choosing the dumb improv event was rude as hell. I resent N so much at this point. I hate that I am starting to hate this smart, talented person because they're exhausting, needy, disorganized, and inconsiderate."

I hate having labels that make people want me to not go out and actually do stuff. They're too concerned. I'm an adult. They think bad stuff is going to happen to me. I think the over concern is the cause of my issues. I'm not allowed to just go out and make friends or even date. It's so irritating. I'm the unreasonable one for questioning it though. Sometimes I want to just leave and not talk to my family for like a month. I don't think I'm doing that bad. They just want me on meds because they don't like a part of me. They want to control me . It makes me mad. I'm gonna tell my DR to wean me off. I think I'll do way better without them."

It's been YEARS I've been in love with this guy (20m) or at least I believe that's love. I've liked him since I was 14, and Since I was 16 I was multiple times rejected by him, he's the kindest man I've known. He wasn't rude about rejecting me he either avoided the argument or did it kindly, that makes me only fall more for him. I'm convinced that we have our really sweet moments and a lot of romantic tension. (Or maybe I'm delusional) I'm jealous he has other female friends, and I hate some of his friends which I think may be one of the reasons I got rejected (btw I don't hate his friends because I'm jealous but because they're downright creeps) and I full on hated him when he protected his friend (a lot older btw) who was being a creep and an asshole to me and he always stands up for that friend who treats him like shit and never for me. He's so kind but lately I start thinking he's more a coward than a good soul. He's a bit challenged too. When someone confronts him on anything serious he doesn't dare to open his mouth not even for breathing. I'm mean sometimes just because I want to see him stand up for himself (and because I'm pissed at him too) but he never does, it makes me mad. I've been in a relationship after he rejected me once and it was kinda terrible, and then after it confessed my feeling when drunk but he completely ignored me. I also think a lot about sex, and that makes me feel so guilty because he's obviously not only not into me but not into relationships, sex or girls in general. But I can't stop, it makes me sick how much I daydream about him and I can't stop no matter how much I date or hookup. I want to date him so much but I know that of he gives me a chance I will ruin him and I don't want to ruin him. Our shared friends (who hangout more with me) say I'm a really toxic person, and I know, I wish I was toxic and unaware because being aware of it makes it all worse, I wish someone to understand I don't mean to be malicious. It just hurts bad. (Not a native English speaker btw, sorry for mistakes)"

    "text": "What even IS this? Hey, 20 F here. I have been diagnosed with both anxiety and depression in the past, so I take Wellbutrin daily. My concern is somewhat...strange(?) because I don't know what this is tied to. Everyday I HAVE to change my phone around. So, wallpaper, app placement, light/dark mode. I delete and install apps, even reinstall ones I've deleted. I haven't gone a single day without doing so, in years. ***I'm always beating myself up or in distress over something. Things that I don't even know why they're stressing me to the point of tears.*** Lately, its the fact that I don't know Chinese or can't get myself to enjoy studying it (note: *I am NOT Asian.* I'm Latina, but have always enjoyed Asian media and culture. I had like a month and a half in the beginning of 2024 that I enjoyed learning simplified Chinese). So now, anytime I try to watch a Chinese drama or listen to an OST, I force myself to stop because the thoughts of NEEDING to know the language are too overwhelming. I end up going on my phone and forcing myself to study until I'm exhausted and can't stand it. Literally have had no fun learning it these past two weeks but when I stop I get so distressed-- same thing happens when I do try though, its a daily tug-of-war. This happened with Korean-- when was OBSESSED with k-pop, Japanese--anime, manga, japanese baseball, Russian--literally liked ONE Russian character and enjoyed watching figure skating, etc. Then I start thinking about people who are learning it, who are capable of reading it, and how they're SO much better than me and the cycle repeats. I stop learning and listen to a song and the need begins again. I don't know if this is because of a self-worth issue, or because of my innate interest in Asia since I was younger? But I'm losing it daily. I delete my language learning app, reinstall, repeat. Guilt arises, I reinstall. Stress and unhappiness over the forced learning, delete. I see someone else learning it? Reinstall. Etc. It doesn't help when I see people say that simply knowing Spanish as a second language isn't as good anymore (as it's my second lang that I'm fluent in), so I start getting insecure...it never ends. On top of this, I tend to learn pronunciation in other languages relatively...easily? So I think about having potential at learning it and stress about NOT learning it because I want to prove that I'm capable? I can't draw without feeling guilty. I can't keep learning ASL because my brain goes to the other language. I can't play a game without feeling like a waste of time. I can't listen to my usual music since I feel like I'm just \"going backwards\" instead of improving(?) -- so I guess, listening to Chinese music to enhance immersion would be going \"forward\" in this point of time for me. I feel like I'm obsessed with self-improvement/productivity or something because I overanalyze everything I do now and feel bad if I don't think it'll give me huge benefits in the future. When the year STARTED, my stress was about my sexuality out of nowhere. I'm telling you, the second I woke up on Jan 1st. I don't know where it came from, but it was a 24/7 stressor. To the point where it was all I watched on YouTube or looked up online. After that subsided around mid Feb, this began. I'm so mentally exhausted and feel so strange because idk why I am like this. I have breakdowns daily because I just don't know HOW to stop this. Maybe I can avoid exposure to the language/culture until I can regulate how I feel, idk. Any...advice? Probably just therapy huh."

Also i didnt know what flair to use im sorry My brain says that i have to do things at a certain time or on a certain day and if i dont do it Then, then often times i Cant do it. Say get up to make food at 6:00, and if i dont get up at exactly 6:00, then i have to wait for 6:30. Sometimes on bad days if i miss my original time then i cant get up until im starving and shaking from it and Need to eat. A less extreme version of that is that if im getting up to do something, it has to be when the clock is at :00, :15, :30, or :45, or else i cant get up. Another example is laundry day, but if i dont do laundry that day, then my brain says that i Cant do it until next saturday or up until I Absolutely Have To because i have no clothes for the next day. I dont know whats stopping me but i feel like im somewhat paralyzed or forbidden from doing whatever it is unless its a specific time/day. Unless i have permission. Permission/direction from someone overrides everything and i can immediately go and do it no matter what time or day but unless i ask for it, it doesnt happen. Often times i just struggle until i absolutely have to do something because there is no option to Not do it. And often times my fragile schedule will fall apart afterwords. My thought process kinda goes \"well i didnt stick with the schedule so why do anything ever again\" and i just lay in bed with the inability to get up and do the thing Ive been diagnosed with anxiety, depression, adhd, and autism. Is this a symptom of one of those? It helps me know terms for what im experiencing and it relieves my anxiety and some stress over it, plus it allows me to do more research and find ways to help me. So if anyone knows if theres a term for this i would eternally be grateful"

Later Addition: \\[Sorry, I know these are not necessarily mental illnesses but I geniunely couldn't find anywhere else I could try to post this. I'm curious about what people think about this as well but also I feel the need to share this with some people as well as it feels... disturbing? (for the lack of a more explanatory word) to keep it inside for 17 years.\\] \\---------------------- So, it might look like it but this is seriously not a shitpost. I'm just trying to be directed towards the right path to understand a part of myself that I haven't thought about much in a long while but suddenly came to my mind. Also, my posts usually don't take off anyway if this post already has some upvotes, please don't upvote it any more. I really don't want this to be seen at the front page of the subreddit as the thought of that feels disturbing. Anyways, without making myself too comfortable in the process, I always had a thing for thinking about unconscious/passed out women as long as I knew myself, like even around 4 or 5 as said in the title. I would dream about that stuff in the primary school and even a clearer example was how I dragged a girl around on the floor (just at normal speed) while we were playing (with her agreeing to play of course) (and we were of course both 4 or 5) and she was acting like she was a fish and I hunted her (silly, I know but kids are kids) in the kindergarten. And I enjoyed that \"game\" we played, like, a lot. Carrying her around like that was so... hot? It can't be at that time as the thing down there wasn't working yet, but it was so enjoyable in a way I can't describe. There were also scenes from the cartoons I watched I would later find from the internet or desperately wait for the scene to appear again TV that included similar or the same things that gave me this same feeling. What's weirder is that, I've been interested in similar kinks as long as I entered puberty, still to this day. Now, I know the fundamentals of this stuff to some degree, at least. I'm not claiming to be an expert but I'm just trying to stay informed. I've done a lot of reading about it even though I didn't get a chance to partake in a scene so far. I know that the trust and consent are the keys, and the importance of safewords and the traffic light system, or something equivalent, and I of course wouldn't try to act out these kinks I didn't mention with someone who doesn't agree to them. Maybe I'm getting too defensive and making too detailed explanations here without a particular reason, but I just don't want to come off as a creep, better to be safe than sorry. So, what might have caused this interests? I'm not asking for a diagnosis as that's impossible to do through internet. It's just... I trust my therapist but there are still stuff I can't talk face to face with him. Like, my mind just goes in a protection mode where I have a hard time analyzing those topics I try to bring to the table, I just lose all my thinking energy that's needed for critical thinking out of stress and my defense mechanism based on some events in the past; but this is a lot easier to do when you're doing this on the internet for obvious reasons. I just wanna try to start from somewhere."

    "text": "Empathy problem I've always wondered what's wrong with me. I have one trait that has been with me absolutely all my life (this is important to keep in mind, as some people may mistake my personality trait as a consequence of something having happened to me at some point in my life). I don't feel empathy towards real people I might meet in life, for example. For the most part, I don't understand the emotions they feel, or I myself don't feel compassion if they have something going on (even if it's someone in my family), but that doesn't mean I hate them. I just can't, I don't know how to force myself to be different. Even though there were more negative moments, I can't really talk about it, but I remember not feeling anything for any people since I was a kid. There wasn't some event that made me this way, it just is, and always has been. But for all that, I am capable of experiencing very deep feelings similar to empathy for inanimate objects and animals. For example, I would be heartbroken if I saw someone stepping on a flower or hurting an animal. When I see something like that, most of the time I start crying and run away somewhere just to avoid seeing it. I also have a hard time getting rid of unwanted items because I feel like I'm betraying them and they are forever alone. Also, on top of that, I can feel something similar about characters when I watch movies, even though they are people. I can't say I understand all the emotions they feel, but I get hurt when my favorite character dies or something bad happens to them. I probably see characters from movies more as \"inanimate\" since with real people in real life I do lack empathy. No doubt I have some very horrible thoughts and ideas, and I also believe in a lot of things that are morally \"wrong\", but I don't see the point in talking about them now. Still, I'd be interested to know what something like this can be called, and whether it can be called \"low empathy\" in general."

I can‚Äôt believe what I‚Äôve learned about **Athena Behavioral Health** and their sister company **Athena OKAS Pvt. Ltd.**‚Äîthis place is an absolute nightmare. If you‚Äôre even thinking about going there, or know someone who is, please‚Äî**DO NOT.** Here‚Äôs why: # 1. They‚Äôre Dodging Taxes Like It‚Äôs a Game These guys are straight-up **scamming the system**. They‚Äôve got all sorts of tricks to avoid paying taxes‚Äîfake invoices, cash payments to dodge GST, and even fudging their books to make it look like they aren‚Äôt making money. They‚Äôre literally **breaking the law** to save a buck. It‚Äôs disgusting. # 2. Employees Are Getting Ripped Off And it‚Äôs not just the government they‚Äôre screwing over‚Äîthey‚Äôre **totally screwing over their employees** too. They play around with salaries to avoid giving people their rightful Provident Fund (PF) and don‚Äôt even bother registering employees for Employee State Insurance (ESI). People are getting paid in cash with no records, no benefits, and no protections. It‚Äôs a mess. # 3. Patients Are at Risk Here If you care about your mental health, **stay far away** from Athena. They‚Äôre not even **properly licensed** to provide care, and they‚Äôre handing out meds without proper documentation or supervision by licensed professionals. They‚Äôre also faking insurance claims, so it‚Äôs not just bad‚Äîit‚Äôs **dangerous**. # 4. They Don‚Äôt Even Follow Basic Health Standards They claim to be accredited, but that‚Äôs **complete BS**. They don‚Äôt meet any of the necessary standards for running a mental health facility. They don‚Äôt have qualified staff, their buildings aren‚Äôt up to code, and they don‚Äôt even follow basic health and safety rules. They‚Äôre lying to everyone, and it‚Äôs **unsafe**. # 5. They‚Äôre Hiding Money and Financials It gets worse. They‚Äôre using **fake shell companies** to hide money and avoid taxes. They‚Äôre literally trying to cover up their financial tracks to make sure no one finds out what they‚Äôre really doing behind the scenes. This is not just shady‚Äîit‚Äôs illegal. # 6. They Don‚Äôt Care About Patients or Consumers On top of all that, they **ignore** complaints from patients. If you‚Äôre overcharged, mistreated, or just want to know what‚Äôs going on with your care or billing, **good luck**. They don‚Äôt give a damn about their patients or consumers. It‚Äôs all about making money for them. # Bottom Line: Don‚Äôt Trust Them If you value your health or your money, do yourself a favor and stay far away from **Athena Behavioral Health**. They‚Äôre not just a bad business‚Äîthey‚Äôre **breaking laws, hurting people, and getting away with it**. Spread the word. Don‚Äôt let anyone you know get sucked into this scam. Just stay away. You‚Äôll thank me later."

It's not the kind where I feel bigger or smaller, it's more so other things look bigger or smaller. Like if I were to look at a cup a couple feet away from me it would look like a giant mountain in the distance. And if I look at somebody their head appears really small and far away. It's the same thing with my hand, it looks like it's several feet away even if it's only a few inches. The times I remember it being triggered the most is when I was getting yelled at/lectured for longer periods of time (15-25 minutes) But that's not the only time it's happened. It also happens when I talk about it, I remember telling my sister about it when suddenly it started happening, same thing with my doctor and with my friend. It's also happened randomly for shorter periods of time, like once my teacher was talking to me about my grades and it got triggered. Another time I was just doing school work and it happened. The episodes usually last about 15 minutes and vary in intensity, this one time it was more extreme than usual, a piano that was about 4-5 feet away looked like it was the size of a shoe. I've been having these occasional episodes since I was about 6-7, I'm the only one I know that has mentioned anything like this. Is this Alice in wonderland syndrome or something else maybe anxiety related?"

I feel selfish for wanting to give up when I know there are people around me who care and want to see me fight through it. At the same time, I don‚Äôt feel like I deserve to feel like this. I feel like I haven‚Äôt suffered enough to warrant healing or anything of that sort. I‚Äôm still mourning my silent attempts, the ones that hurt me deeply, but I stayed quiet. I never spoke up. They weren‚Äôt loud or dramatic attempts, and I guess because of that, I feel like they don‚Äôt matter. I‚Äôve struggled with an eating disorder for years, but I‚Äôm not even underweight. In fact, right now, I‚Äôm overweight, and it feels like I‚Äôm failing at everything. My self-harm? Yeah, it‚Äôs bad, but is it really that bad? I‚Äôve never had to go to the hospital. I‚Äôve never had stitches. Most of my scars are shallow now. But the thing is, I‚Äôve been overlooked and dismissed my entire life. People don‚Äôt care until you‚Äôre on the verge of losing everything. I‚Äôve had a licensed therapist tell me that my scars weren‚Äôt serious compared to her other clients. I‚Äôve had people tell me that my grief isn‚Äôt justified. Yes, people validated my grief when I lost both of my grandparents, especially my grandmother, who was like my second mom. But even then, I felt like I had no right to grieve. My mom lost both of her parents in a short span of time, and I couldn‚Äôt help but feel like my grief wasn‚Äôt as valid as hers.

As for friendships, people just say, ‚ÄúPeople come and go.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like they died.‚Äù But the truth is, I lost the most meaningful and authentic relationships I‚Äôve ever had. I lost the people I trusted enough to truly be myself around, the ones who knew me in a way no one else ever did. Lately, I‚Äôve been feeling incredibly alone. I‚Äôm about to drop out of college, and all the grief I‚Äôve been suppressing is surfacing. I‚Äôve been dissociating and numbing myself for so long that it feels like everything is hitting me all at once. On top of that, I‚Äôm moving out on my own, and I‚Äôm slowly losing contact with my roommate, the only friend I still have. Look at me, though‚Äîhow pathetic it is that I can‚Äôt just shake off this self-pity. Here I am, venting on reddit like it‚Äôs some kind of cry for attention."

If I wrong people or just have a guilty conscience it completely eats me up and I feel like the worst human being that ever walked this earth. It sometimes goes so far that I get extremely suicidal because of my guilty conscience and start thinking about how I'll do it and get to writing the letters etc. I never end up doing it, but just talking about the situation that made me feel that way makes me feel some strong feeling that I can't quite pinpoint. Is this normal, and if yes how do I cope with this? Idek if this is the right subreddit for this, but I just don't know who else to ask, because I feel like it's something everyone goes through and I'm just a big fat pussy."

    "text": "Help please I was diagnosed with GAD a couple of weeks ago (12 days on Lexapro), but I cannot get the sinking feeling that there is something terribly wrong or off with me. I often have feelings that things around me are not actually there even though I know they are. I am not very present in the moment, and I feel hyperfixated on the fact that there is something wrong with me (constantly browsing Reddit and Googling mental illnesses). I can't ever quite put to words what is wrong, but I think that there is a connection between the way that I am feeling and a terrible acid trip I had a while ago where I felt psychosis. (Although I don't actually believe it.) The problem is that I feel like I can never really escape these thoughts, and they consume all my waking hours. I went to the ER a couple of days ago and was about to voluntarily hospitalize myself because some social worker said I had displayed symptoms of a psychotic disorder. I ended up not hospitalizing myself because I hoped that I was not \"crazy.\". Does anyone have any similar experiences?"

    "text": "Intrusive thoughts and feelings make me feel like I don't know what my identity is or my values. Hi there. I'm a 30-year-old man and was diagnosed with Major Depression and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. I hospitalized myself back in December for suicidal thoughts and had the flu at the time. They put me on Latuda and Sertraline and told me it was Bipolar 2. I feel whatever for the next 2 months. Got 2 therapists surprisingly, one for EMDR and one for CBT, a psychiatrist (after cycling through 3), and waiting for a peer support program. I switched from 60mg of Prozac to 50 mg of Sertraline and 20 mg of Latuda in the hospital back in December, and the first month and a half of that made me feel less anxious about everything, but the depression was definitely still there, along with some intrusive thoughts every now and then. 2 weeks ago, my psychiatrist outside the hospital told me I most likely am dealing with just Major Depression and took me off of the Latuda and upped my Sertraline to 100 mg. She said if I'm not feeling better by this coming Thursday, up it again to 150mg. When I stopped the Latuda, the first 2 days I felt fine. The next 2 days I slept over 30 hours total. Then the next 6 days leading up to now have been insanely bad for me. Monday: Just felt groggy I believe Tueday: Water got shut off and I had the urge to cry the entire day, and when I got back from errands and appointments, I burst out crying for about 10 minutes straight. Thought I was going to need to go back to the hospital because suicidal thoughts came up again, but after crying I felt a little better. Wednesday: I woke up feeling really crappy and intrusive thoughts were really bad (mornings have been the worst part of the day for me this week). Felt a little better later on. Thursday: I think this day was the day I started to not feel like myself. I feel like I've changed somehow, or maybe I'm starting to dissociate. I'm not completely sure, but the mental gymnastics and rumination start here. Friday: The feeling intensifies, and I just have intrusive thoughts questioning everything I've done, am doing, and will do. I start to feel like I've lost my morals and values and am just a blank canvas waiting to be painted evil and paranoid by my intrusive thoughts. Saturday (Today): I wake up from a dream where I felt no emotions from all the craziness happening around me. Almost all day I've felt like I've become, or am becoming, a changed person and don't hold any of the values I used to have. Like I'm just waiting for something to happen to me and that will define who I become, or I'll just start accepting the intrusive thoughts as fact and become that person. This feels like my soul is caged by a wicker basket and the intrusive thoughts are trying to crush it until I change, for better or worse. Guess I'm writing all this out for anyone that has had similar experiences, maybe? Or just advice on things that could help me? I haven't written to this board before, but I'd like to hear any replies, honestly. I'm also sorry if this is typed out poorly. Thank you."

    "text": "She told me I was everything to her a day before, now I don't exist. What happened? Text: I (23M) was in a relationship with my ex (22F) for a year. We loved each other intensely, almost foolishly. She was a genuinely amazing person‚Äîsupportive, kind, and loving. She stood by me even when I had doubts, and I struggled because she had so many great qualities. But suddenly, everything changed, and now it feels like I never existed to her. The Biggest Issue in Our Relationship: From the start, my struggle was acceptance‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt feel 100% sure about her. I liked her, but I kept questioning whether she was \"the one.\" She knew about my hesitation and was patient, believing we could work through it. Despite my doubts, we were deeply connected. I was incredibly supportive of her, especially during her mental health struggles. I went to therapy, both for myself and to understand her condition. I tried everything to make this relationship work, and she did the same for me. What Happened to Her? (A Breakdown in Steps) 1. She stopped taking her medication (Carbalt) in late January 2025. 2. She entered a phase of unusual energy, confidence, and hyperactivity‚Äîa stark contrast to her usual withdrawn self. 3. Then, she faced multiple personal crises: Fights with her family. Conflict with an old friend (who was also the sister of her ex). 4. She started showing drastic personality changes: Became aggressive, impulsive, and confrontational. Started swearing more and posting bizarre videos with confusing statements. Changed her online identity and dressed differently. 5. A few days later, she broke up with me, saying: \"We were lying to ourselves. Your eyes were never fully on me.\" \"This relationship wasn‚Äôt right for us.\" 6. I simply asked her not to talk about me on TikTok. She reacted by: Sending me a 5-minute voice note full of insults. Blocking me everywhere. How I Tried to Help Even after she blocked me, I knew something was wrong. I contacted her therapist, who then reached out to her family. They couldn‚Äôt find her for hours. I went to another doctor near her home for advice. I helped track her phone location to get her safely to the hospital. She was hospitalized for weeks. Meanwhile, she started messaging one of my old friends, someone I had past conflicts with because she used to be overly friendly with him. She told him everything about our relationship, even though she once said: \"If I ever leave you, I‚Äôll disappear from your life completely, including your friends.\" Now, they still talk to this day. After She Got Out of the Hospital She reopened social media but removed me instead of blocking me this time. When I saw her stories, she removed me completely. She acts as if I never existed. What Her Cousin Told Me (Who Still Talks to Her) I reached out to her cousin, Randa, who told me: She still holds resentment toward anyone who was around her during her crisis. She believes everyone who tried to help actually hurt her. She isn‚Äôt ready to face people who remind her of that period. Edit : I didn't ask for the diagnosis as the therapist told me that his ethics can't allow him doing that, I didn't ask her cousin and i really need to know what happened but it seems in our culture that may be i will be an Intruder as We didn't get married or even plan seriously to do so we were just in a romantic relationship and literally fixing my sight and acceptance for here at therapy sessions cause we both wanted to continue but I didn't dully accept her, she knew all of that ,even though she loved and accepted the state as it was till we figure it out. üåÄFor what really happened after all of that month at the hospital, I couldn't ask her family about her due to our society restrictions , I was praying for ger for a month and giving her such excuses as she wasn't normal at doing these actions , then I was surprised after a month that she was talking to that friend that we struggled due to him , then appearing on social media and removing me from Instagram and Facebook and interacting with these friend and here other friends like Don't care about my reaction... Even though that friend came and told me everything and said to me that he respected my My existence back in her life so not treating her like she will not be his gf But she is acting like she didn't know me before and I am afraid to talk to her or even seeing her in the university as the therapist said she might take a bad action against you or I might even see her with another one or in a bad state that hurts me I EVEN DIDN'T MOVE ON TILL A MONTH LATER without knowing anything about here and just waiting her to heal (which still in progress) and just GIVING HER AN EXCUSE THAT SHE IS ILL , now SHE IS LIVING HER LIFE LOOKING GOOD AND TALKING TO THAT FRIEND AND I'M STUCK HERE DIDN'T EVEN TAKE THE ACTION OF MOVING ON ! I really so loyal to her but her actions rn are so painful to me despite their reason wether they're due to mental illness or Personal will& personal decision The therapist told me that she blocked me when that happened earlier and when she left the hospital she removed me again ü§∑üèª I think removing is different than blocking for her as she was believing that doors might be opened in the future again and she actually told me that when she blocked me but I'm afraid that these doors might not open again anymore üò≠ as chatgpt said that these traumatic people might change with No way back --- Now, I‚Äôm here, wondering what actually happened. Did her mental health shift make her genuinely stop loving me? Was this truly a breakup she wanted, or was it influenced by her condition? Has anyone else experienced something like this? Can someone just delete you from their life so easily after everything?"

He had a very bad divorce with a restraining order involved with his ex wife. Probably was not necessary but it is what it is. Long story. He had supervised visitation and lost it bc of his mental health issues. He‚Äôs been diagnosed as bipolar 1 but also seems to be slipping into a schizophrenic state. He believes there is a high powered government run gang out to destroy his life and that his ex wife and son have been kidnapped. Nothing further from the truth. My question is: how do you get a 43 year old mentally ill man to see they need help? He thinks nothing is wrong with him and believes all these delusions mentioned - and many more. We have no idea what to do with him after he gets out of jail? My parents are 80. They can‚Äôt deal with this. He‚Äôs also nasty and just plain mean. What do you do with a person like this? I feel like he‚Äôs destined for an early death or being on the streets. Any help is appreciated. I need a plan and ideas to help my parents."

(or the other way around?) (also, im pretty sure our breasts hadn't developed yet, so idk if that narrows down the age.) then my aunt called us frm the window and i could kind of see her face peaking through the curtains so i rushed to close them properly and we hurried to dress and go down. (this was the reason why i thought i was the one who first hugged her frm behind bc i was the one who closed the curtains.) that night, when we got home, i cried myself to sleep. i hated what i did and resented myself for agreeing to even do that. but it happened again, idk how far apart they were, probably a few months, like 2-3. and this time i'm sure she was the one who suggested it. i was hesitant, i wanted to say no, but i didnt. instead, i was able to convince her to put something in between our lips. (?) i know i was at fault, that i agreed to it with no shame when she Was disabled. but i really need some help. idk if i was to blame, hell i dont even know if i was the one to suggest all of that the first time. i wish i hadn't made myself forget, then i would have a clearer picture in my head and more to base my opinions on, but i dont. so please help me. ps: i still had a good relationship with her after that though, i still used to help her in school before i left last year. i just had always hoped she forgot and didn't tell anyone."

I don't feel like I belong. I can't find a job that pays a liveable wage. I have had a good amount of jobs for my age. Don't have a driver license yet and I can't afford lessons right now but whats the point if I can't afford a car. Even if I work full time and make 600 a week I still wouldn't be able to afford one. I am in community college for accounting. I worked 30 hours a week at a pharmacy and made 400 a week still not enough. I can't afford anything and it sucks to know that this is how life is and I would have to work 3 jobs. I reduced my hours to focus on studying but now I can't afford hobbies or all of my needs and definitely not any wants. Right now I'm still studying but don't know how I will keep paying for college since my father is a tax evader for fafsa. I could do a payment plan but It will be all of my money. I binge eat. I don't have anyone to talk to. I have mental illnesses including depression and when I was on antidepressants I gained lots of weight and binge eating got worse so I stopped. I see a therapist and it doesn't help all they do is just suggest meds. My dad is dying and I never grieved my brother committing suicide. I'm lonely but a man could quickly make my life worse and more complicated. All the jobs I've been applying to virtually pay the same $12-18. I'm back to self harming. I feel like a failure and feel guilty for being alive. My parents are abusive but I don't want to have a victim complex. I still live with them and I am not able to afford to move out even with roommates. Maybe my expectations for earning is too high and my standards for life as well. I went to beauty school to become a certified nail technician just to find that there's virtually no job openings out there for that near me at the moment. Or they are part time working 1-2 days a week. I'm considering selling press ons though but its a saturated market and I don't know who would buy from me. I have had 2 businesses ages 16-20 that flopped. Multiple hobbies that flopped and there is absolutely nothing that I am passionate about or enjoy. I don't enjoy entertainment either. I'm not sure what to do with my life and how to feel better and I have been forcing myself for the past few weeks to forget every single thing and move forward but I genuinely do not see much to be happy about. When I confided in my friend she said I'm privileged and my life is not that bad and they have it worse. I'm not doubting others have it worse at all. What prompted me to write this post is while searching for a new job because my current one I am very underpaid and staff is toxic and I am sick of abuse from the customers, I realized I still can barely find anything that would allow me to live that I got overwhelmed and cried and my mother said that I need to grow up and asked me how am I going to manage to survive which is true, and I don't think I will to be honest. She also said that me crying causes her stress and said that the stress I cause her and my dad is what turns them to drink. She says I make excuses which I think is true in some cases. I have been dissocoating for the past 6 years and every second every minute every week every month and every year passes by me in seconds. I will wake up one day and be 50 if i make it to then wondering where all the time has gone. I think the people in my life think I am weak which is true. I'm not even trying to seek pity or be self pity or a victim but I just don't see the point. I am not a victim it is all my fault and I believe any abuse that I have endured I must of have deserved it. I just get easily overwhelmed and I don't know why and I am immature. I don't know what to do with my life and I need someone to tell me."

    "text": "Childhood memories, symptom diagnosis suggestions? Vent Hey Reddit, I know the internet is not always the best tool for a mental health diagnosis but I no longer suffer from these symptoms and haven‚Äôt for some time so even a false diagnosis would cause no harm, I just want answers out of curiosity. As a child I had severe anger issues, a problem with compulsive lying even if it got me in more trouble than the truth, and whenever my mom would explain to other people how awful I could be I would always act like an angel in public and have great manners but only act bad in my house, I also went through a pyromaniac phase at 11. Not sure if those traits are gonna help towards a conclusion but maybe they will so just dropping that info. I can‚Äôt remember the dreams but I remember feeling impending doom after waking up from them and my mom would come in my room and in the middle of the night and said she woke up to me yelling and scratching the wall which I didn‚Äôt even know was possible from night terrors. I also up until I turned about fifteen would always see ‚Äúshadow people‚Äù frequently but not clearly, always in my peripheral vision and couldn‚Äôt make it out, I‚Äôd see the silhouette of a dark figure opening my closed door and then look at my door and my doors still closed and stuff like that. I also valued pets like my dogs just as much if not more so than I did people and still do, I was hard to control so was mostly in my room grounded from 6- 13 years old with my books and my dogs to keep me company so they became my company. I grew up with a single mom working two jobs who was gone before I woke up and home after I was asleep, but we lived with her old friend who we would find out to be a severely sick narcissist, when my mom wasn‚Äôt home she would give me the ‚Äú slap you and give you candy‚Äù treatment. Never physically, but emotionally, she would tell me my mom didn‚Äôt believe in me, but she did pretty much, and just wanted to feed into the idea of me hating my mom and liking her as an ego thing. She was a compulsive liar as well who even ate all my Halloween candy one year and blamed it on me so my mom got mad at me since I had an eating disorder. My traits developed around the same time we moved in with her, were these learned from her or was I just this way as a kid. No doctors could give my mom a definitive diagnosis and they just gave me a bunch of treatment drugs like lithium to calm me despite having no idea what was wrong with me. At around 14 I started to lose my anger, and the only thing that made it leave was sadness, because of all the stress I caused my mom and nights she spent crying after I said I hated her, I thought she hated me but it was her friend lying all those years and I felt terrible. Ever since that realization I physically can‚Äôt feel ‚Äúrage‚Äù I can get annoyed but I literally haven‚Äôt felt true anger since and that also worries me. Sorry for the off topic rant but are these traits or symptoms common with certain diagnosis‚Äô?"

    "text": "Something is wrong with me and I don‚Äôt know what to do THIS CONTAINS SELF HARM. I think, not entirely sure? Anyway. To preface: I‚Äôm a 15 year old girl and I have already been diagnosed with ADHD and Autism, but this is not my concern. Lately, I have been having very explosive anger outbursts over small things and in result I have been hyperventilating, scratching myself until I bleed, and disassociating heavily. I always have a strong urge to do something big like rip out my hair or punch a hole in my wall or throw my phone at concrete and to cope with these feelings I‚Äôve just been scratching my skin. As an example, today I was watching tv in my living room and my mom came home and turned off the fan that I had on. (She has issues with fans and doesn‚Äôt like the way they feel). I got very upset because it was hot in the living room, and I asked her if we could come to a compromise, to which she absolutely refused. It made me super upset for some reason and I felt like the only thing I could do was leave the room before I said or did something I would regret. I had already started crying (for some reason?) before I left the room, and when I did leave the room, my dad said ‚Äúperfect timing‚Äù(meaning now he could take over the tv for himself since I was leaving) and it just made me feel so embarrassed and defeated. I left to my room and hyperventilated/sobbed while throwing things and being incredibly destructive for a good 45 minutes before I decided to take a bath. I was still crying and sobbing heavily when I got into the bath and then I really started scratching my arms. Both arms are now really scratched up and I just feel really stupid for over reacting so terribly. During all of this, I felt out of my body. It felt like my mind would be running with thoughts but I couldn‚Äôt control my body or I felt like I was someone else. Along with this, I feel like I am slowly losing my sense of self. I don‚Äôt want to do things I usually enjoy and I have no idea what I look like. Some days I think I‚Äôm absolutely hideous and I don‚Äôt want anyone to see me or even go outside, while other days I think that everyone is looking at me because I look good.. So overall I just feel like I‚Äôm losing myself and I don‚Äôt know what to do. If anyone reads this, thank you. (I hope I did this right, this is my first Reddit post. Also, I am trying my best to not violate the rules here so, I am not looking for a formal diagnosis but rather some advice on what do to with myself here)."

I have issues with anxiety, depression, and ADHD. I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was in elementary school. The same things keep happening to me over and over again. No matter how hard I try to avoid the same mistakes or disasters, they keep happening over and over again. I need help, and I am trying to find the right help. I am tired of getting angry and walking out on my job. You see I keep having these panic attacks. I get angry and do things out of impulse without thinking about it. I would get so angry that I would walk out of my job. Sometimes, I would smash and break things on the way out. Sometimes I would just walk out. I always have a hard time getting along with others or the managers. I always feel like an outcast no matter what I do or try. I got so used to not having friends that it does not matter whether I fit in anymore. I dwell on things too much, even when I try not to. I always take things too personally, even when I try not to. I flip out when I get angry and go crazy. But what's weird? It takes a lot to get me angry. But once I'm angry, I go nuts or wild. The weird part is I'm usually friendly, calm, and laid back until when you piss me off or get on my bad side. Some folks say it sounds like I have different personalities. They would say because there is the calm Me, shy Me, and crazy Me. I also keep getting complaints at work that I'm talking too loud. But to me, I don't sound that loud. I always get complaints about not being fast enough or unable to complete the work. I am very ashamed to talk about these issues I have. But I have to know, is anyone else going through this?

    "text": "Moral OCD/Paranoia Disorder??? I'm not sure this is the right subreddit for this but here I go. My entire life I've felt responsible for how everyone around me feels. I'm constantly worrying that I did something wrong or \"immoral\" to someone I care about (or something \"wrong\" in general), and when I do, my whole world falls apart and I feel horribly anxious and paranoid that that means I'm no longer a good person when I've spent my life believing and trying to reflect that. I can't rock the boat in school either. I've always been a good student and seen almost as a \"teacher's pet\", and even the thought of ruining that is terrifying because to me, that teacher would hate me and I'd ruin my reputation. Mistakes terrify me too, specifically with social situations. In 7th grade, a former friend and I got into an argument with each other, and I let my mouth run to anyone wanting to know what happened. It's been almost 4 years since that and I still feel like she resents me (when she's been nice to me) and that deep down, people still think I'm that idiotic 12 year old. I feel like everyone is almost \"out to get me\" in a way, even my closest friends. I'm scared the people who know me secretly hate me or are talking shit behind my back. A little bit ago, my bsf's ex said that ny bsf was shit talking me, and I believed her because I know that she can be nasty towards the people she doesn't like and doesn't even distance herself from those people either. I ended up confronting my bsf about it after she asked why I blocked her and she denied everything and was genuinely taken aback by it. We cleared things up in the end, but I worry that she hates me for believing her ex, or that I was stupid for believing her ex and that means I'm a bad friend/person. I also internalize every mistake I make and try to avoid them at any cost. For instance, I used to be so terrified of driving simply because I was mortified of making a mistake on the road. Yesterday, I accidentally ran a crosswalk in a parking lot because there was no sign and I was about to just stop the car and make one of my parents drive because, in my head, \"I fucked up. I can't do this. I can't believe I made a mistake. I upset everyone because I did that\". Not only that, but it's literally like everytime I make a mistake or don't know something, I actually, genuinely upset people. When I ran that crosswalk, my parents immediately got loud and yelled at me, especially my dad who just has to dwell on everything that goes wrong. And it's been like that since I was young so I get that the mistake thing may be like a trauma response or something like that. But it still makes me wonder if I developed a disorder because of it. I'm a maladaptive daydreamer, so who knows if I have something else. The reason I bring up moral scrupulosity OCD is because I identify with a lot of the symptoms and compulsions such as: - Feeling responsible for others' wellbeing - Seeking reassurance about moral issues - Avoiding situations that could cause conflict (and make me feel immoral/like a bad person) - Excessively apologizing for a mistake or conflict (and then feeling bad for apologizing because it makes me think the other person thinks I'm being manipulative, though that's specific to me) - Constantly wondering if I did something wrong - Excessive guilt I have another, specific compulsion/ritual (at least I think it's that) where, if I were to put my empty sandwich bag or other garbage by someone, it would make them think that I think I don't like them or think of them as garbage. I don't know what's wrong with me and I'm sorry if I offend anyone diagnosed with these disorders. I'm trying to make as much of an educated guess as I can and wanna know what the rest of yall in the sub think."

    "text": "Seeking Advice on Regaining Motivation and Getting Off Medications After Drug-Induced Psychosis Hi everyone, I‚Äôm reaching out for advice or insights about a situation I‚Äôve been dealing with for the past two years. After experiencing a drug-induced psychosis, I was put on antipsychotics and antidepressants. Over time, my dosage has been gradually reduced, and for the last three months, I‚Äôve been taking only half a tablet of Cypralex (escitalopram) and half a tablet of Kempro (olanzapine) daily. During my recent visit to my psychiatrist, I shared that I‚Äôve been struggling with a complete lack of drive or passion to excel, succeed, or even engage in activities I used to enjoy. He mentioned that I might be experiencing something called **amotivational syndrome** (I think that‚Äôs what he called it‚Äîplease correct me if I‚Äôm wrong). He explained that this could be due to one of three reasons: 1. Drug use (I‚Äôve been clean for over a year, so this likely isn‚Äôt the cause). 2. Depression (I don‚Äôt feel depressed, so this seems unlikely). 3. An after-effect of the psychosis I experienced. He believes it‚Äôs probably the third reason‚Äîlingering effects of the psychosis. Here‚Äôs the thing: I don‚Äôt feel like myself anymore. Before the medications, I had drive, passion, and a sense of purpose. Now, I feel like I‚Äôm just going through the motions. I want to get off these medications for good and regain the person I used to be, but I‚Äôm not sure how to do that safely or effectively. Has anyone here gone through something similar? If so, how did you navigate getting off medications while rebuilding your motivation and sense of self? Are there specific therapies, lifestyle changes, or strategies that helped you? I‚Äôd also love to hear from anyone who has successfully tapered off medications under medical supervision and how they managed the transition. Any advice or shared experiences would mean a lot to me. Thank you in advance!"

Around the time of middle school, a friend thought it was funny to wrap her hands around my neck and sometimes would also kind of squeeze, but not enough to hurt me or cut off my air. I told her to stop and she didn't until high school. While I was in high school I had a boyfriend who touched my neck and I'd always jerk away. Even if there was a wall behind me, I wouldn't care. I'd hit my head on the wall if I had to say he'd stop touching my neck. Also, the girl randomly jumped on me or touched me and now I freak out at random touches. I'm asking if anyone might know if this is something like PSTD, anxiety, or if I'm just overreacting since the girl never did cut off my air. Edit: She did this multiple times for the 2 years I was in middle school. In high school, she acted nicer, and I knew she was better due to her asking to touch me and such. I still tried to stay away from her and attempted to move classes to avoid her or have my other friends talk to her. I got flashbacks throughout high school and still get them now. Some days, I avoid everything due to flashbacks in the morning or during the day. Other times, I don't get flashbacks unless the girl directly talks to me or touches me. I think my ex-boyfriend also made it worse since he did a similar thing yet never choked me."

However, despite my previous struggles, I now find myself in a position that aligns with my aspirations: I am attending university, achieving grades that I am reasonably proud of, working in my dream job, and surrounded by genuine friends. Yet, despite these accomplishments, I am plagued by desire to just be gone. This realization has led me to a troubling conclusion: that these feelings may be a permanent fixture in my life. I do feel although I have friends, they are very much just passers by and it won‚Äôt have much impact if I am no longer here. I can‚Äôt live the rest of my life like this and my thoughts of acting on these impulses are becoming more and more tangible. I don‚Äôt know what to do."

I have a lot of issues but was abused by my parents, neglected at best so I never got much help, especially for mental issues. I've never been well but these days I don't even feel human. I remember a time where derealization was just a new word, then a theory, and now my every day feels like a struggle for consciousness. I've tried seeking help but couldn't until I was an adult and had such a short window for it that I tried to cram a lot into a short time and failed miserably. When I was 18 trying to get help for ADHD I was trying to explain too much and the doctor said \"derealization isn't a symptom of ADHD\", dismissed me having ADHD as a whole (despite that being so obvious to me), and didn't even bother to help something that was upsetting me. I felt it for the first time and it lasted days to weeks, the time frame was so odd I'm not really sure. But now it's how I feel most days. TMI but I've been on the toilet for a half hour because I am having a hard time feeling my bladder at the moment and I'm simultaneously afraid of pissing myself if I leave and second guessing that I'm even on the toilet and thinking I'm pissing myself now. I've been living like this for so long that it's genuinely terrifying and some days it's so bad I can't even form clear thoughts or do simple math and I have always been so good at math. It's beginning to feel how I imagine the early stages of dementia does. And I have no idea what's happening. I don't have enough money to take care of my basic human needs let alone my health. I'm 23 now and I have seen a doctor maybe twice since I was 18, both times before I was 20, and I last saw a Psychiatrist when I was 18, just long enough to be diagnosed with PTSD but not find out until a year after I stopped seeing him when I was looking up my medical records. I have very few diagnoses and just struggling. I feel doomed to fail and I've always joked about my problems but the fact that I feel so helpless so often is terrifying and I'm completely independent. If I can't function then I'm screwed."

They are the kind of parents that think I'm just emotional and dramatic. when they found my suicide note they acted normal but my dad confronted me and just said oh god wouldn't want you to die. Or something like that - I'm not religious so...and my parents I genuinely can't tell them about my mental health they will only do something about it if they FIND OUT, not me telling them. So I'm wondering if you can just ask the school nurse to send you to a pysch ward and they will contact your parents and stuff or is that not how it works?"

Benzos just made it worse so i stopped. They only helped the panic that ocd itself brings because its so stressful and awful but its temporary relief and not worth what benzos come with so I told my Dr i was leaving them. I also have a chronic GI disease and it is linked to lack of serotonin. So i decided to finally give an SSRi a try. I started Fluvoxamine 25mg once a day, almost a month ago. On week two of that, i went up to 50mg. Ive been there since. I felt better the first few days on 50mg (thoughts were still there but not as brutal which is a relief and a blessing in itself) and all of a sudden i feel incredibly down and stagnant and the thoughts are almost worsening. Not sure if i should stay on 50mg for a few more weeks, in the hope that itll be enough of a a dose and i just simply have to give it time? Or is it not enough of a dose for OCD and i should just go up to 75mg for a few days, and then to 100mg? (Id like to not go over 100mg for as long as i can for now) Please help. Ive heard and read and been told that im on way too low of a dose for OCD, especially OCD as severe as mine. Would really appreciate feedback from others that have actually gone through it."

I'm 18F and graduated school in 2024. Ever since school ended I've felt so empty. I have a learning disability as well as anxiety and depression, I was diagnosed at a young age. I struggled making friends in school and had a hard time learning, I was also in the mental hospital in 11th grade. I was doing decent for a bit, taking my meds, going to therapy, etc. I felt normal, like I knew who I was. But recently, I feel like nothings working, the thoughts of not wanting to live and feeling hopeless are back. I've tried working at 2 different places but I'm so horrified. The second time I cried infront of the supervisor. My dad thinks I'm lazy, he tells me \"I'm only hurting myself\" and I know that, but I just can't seem to fix myself. It feels like I'm in a world that isn't meant for me, everyone around me has a place or something they're good at, but I don't. I was very into art and writing but now I can't even bring myself to do the things I love. I cant even play video games, I just scroll on my phone all day. I'm just so stuck right now, everything seems impossible. I don't want to die but I keep telling myself \"That's the only thing you can do\". And I can't be honest with my therapist because I'll be put into the hospital and my parents can't afford that. I'm so scared of myself. I'm so tired of trying to be a person."

    "text": "I was going to kill myself today When I was 8, I was raped by 2 teenagers. Multiple times. They told me they were going to kill my family. I was terrified. So I didn't fight them the time after that, or the many other times that followed. The rapes only stopped because my mom couldn't pay the rent and we had to move. When I was in middle school, my mother had taken too many prescription pills and totaled our only car with my brother in it. My mother was arrested and my brother was fine. I missed my mom when she was in jail. She got released a week later. She got back on schedule with her medications. And then I remember begging her to be part of this family, because she had been abusing her meds again. I started drinking in middle school. I didn't stop. We had many pets, and in that sense I watched many of my pets due to not being able to afford vet care. I remember when we lost power on Christmas week and we froze all week. I remember boiling water to bathe and dumping water outside of my bathroom window because the tub wouldn't drain. I started cutting myself in middle school. Everyone thought it was because me and my friend had a falling out because my mother attacked her father. We became friends again and I did stop cutting myself. I hated the attention it had brought me. I felt so empty. I started smoking weed and experienced my first panick attack. I kept smoking weed, I kept drinking. I was in high school when I met her. Her mom did cocaine, we did Cocaine. I missed a lot of school. I was quite drunk or high for most of my developing years. I got my first legal job at 17. I worked as much as I could. I started paying bills around the house. I felt helpful. I drank every night. I met him during high school. It started as a one night stand, but he had a car and knew how to get me off. I remember him calling me in the middle of the night for me to go meet him in his car and we'd go smoke weed and fuck until I had to be to school the next day. I started college a year after high school. I got worse then, but made good and bad friends. I fell in love, again. My love got arrested. I was 20 then. I moved back home and he moved in. We had been together the whole time. He became angrier. He would yell, he would scream at me day after day. Then he would hit me. I used to tell him no, but he would pin me. I stopped crying so long ago. I knew I didn't deserve anything else, not even death. I found out I was pregnant at 21. I hadn't gotten my period for 3 months. I still drank heavily. I even convinced my friend to cauterize a cut on his finger. I was 9 weeks when I was able to get my abortion. I had to go in for the vaginal ultrasound, there wasn't a heart beat. That broke me. I always wanted kids, but I couldn't have a child with this man, especially a dead one. I suffered alone with that. I bled and cried and drank and smoked. My mom left me. I was in and out of therapy. He hated when I went to therapy. I had a good counselor, but I fucked that up too when I tried to sleep with him. Part of me thinks I still would. I had always planned on killing myself. It never got better for so long. And then I met my lover. He showed me kindness my own mother couldn't. He gave me refuge and love. We fucked too, of course. I left my ex. I tried to. I packed my stuff and left to go be with my lover and his kids. And that's where I'm at today. Nearly 4-5 years later. Still in and out of therapy. Now on medications and now clean. Diagnosed with Barrets esophagus, non dysplasia, and PTSD, Depression, GAD and probably more. But the last few months I started using body soap and a loofah, in addition to my very few self care routines and now I use lotion on my bumpy arms. I go to the gym. I just graduated with my RN degree and have a high chance of passing my boards. I fell in love with caring for people when I became a CNA. I am surrounded by healthy animals who's bills I can afford. I have such a patient and loving man helping me navigate my crazyund and crazy past. I get frustrated with myself easily, and he reassures me constantly. It's not a perfect road for either of us. Lots of trial and error, especially getting me sober or navigating my moods. I talk to my family again and I miss them now. I see them more. I have good relationships with people. I did lose a lot of my old friends, but I had to. I am doing so much better, and of course I still fuck up and of course I still cry all the time, but I'm healing. I'm 28 and I should of been dead at 25. I do not want to kill myself. I just want to be a little better every year. Don't give in, never give up. It's tough. And I'm still fighting my head every day, nearly every second. But it does go silent at work. Or when I see the kids having a moment or when we go to fairs. It helps."

Seeing that video of the Holiday Inn employee reminded me of this. I‚Äôve felt and acted the same in many situations because I have a borderline personality. My BPD has made me run away, punch myself in the head, get black out drunk on a work night. Mental illness isn‚Äôt an entirely universal experience of lying in bed and crying. It can be much scarier. I‚Äôve gotten help within the past year for this and i have more control over it now but seeing that poor man having what clearly was a mental breakdown made my heart break. He needed compassion and help, not someone recording him in a vulnerable mindset. I just wish more people would realise how complicated mental illness is."

I'm not really sure how to explain this, but a few years ago I noticed that I get really triggered by the sudden changes in a person's tone of voice when they are speaking to me, even if I know they had no intention of being mean/rude. When this happens I instantly fall into a state of depression and disassociate. This can last anywhere from a few minutes to days. Depending on the situation, I won't be able to talk or really process what is going on in the moment. Often times when I snap out of it, I don't remember what happened right before, during and/or shortly after my disassociation. Has anyone else experienced this or know someone who has? If so, what do you find helpful in these situations? Is there anything that helps minimize your reaction/impact and snap out of your disassociated state quickly?"

Anyway, my friend who has schizophrenia is constantly struggling and the representation of people with it in the media can be pretty f@*king disgusting and is very upsetting to her. Not too long ago, she walked out of a shitty shaliman movie in tears. People really need to stop making every single serial killer character schizophrenic; its kind of disgusting, honestly. More often they are more in danger of hurting themselves and I even knew a guy with it who committed suicide...He was no murderor. I think schizophrenia needs just as much activism surrounding it, as autism.. It is a serious structural illness of the brain that can be very isolating and these dumb movies don't help. And the medications for it are the WORSTüòû (I don't have it, but have other problems and have used it as an augmentation to my depression medication) It just makes me sad.

Don't get me wrong many things can be linked back to childhood trauma but it seems like people that know about your mental illness can't accept it if there's no story to it. It seems like people always try to dig up something in your past and say that your mental illness is invalid if you can't find any connection to childhood trauma. Why can't people just accept that sometimes it's genetic, chemical, or due to current situations? Sometimes there's no reason, or any from environmental factors you can think of.

It's my job to eat more, it's my job to decide how and when and who and where to get healthcare from, to make all the calls and the plays in my own recovery. The same people who wouldn't trust me to water their plants for a weekend trust me to navigate the ridiculous obstacle course that the mental healthcare system is. I'm sick of it.

If you watch it, you‚Äôll see a psychology student reflecting on how her first day working as a ‚Äúpsychologist in training‚Äù at a psych unit for children didn‚Äôt go as as expected because she saw a patient (a child) eating their own feces. The comments range from shock to laughter and others just being entertained at what must‚Äôve been a very humiliating experience for a child who was probably in a traumatized and/or severely impaired mental state. On tiktok I see many mental health practitioners or therapists/interns/psychologists talking about their patients. Normally I would just get upset and move on, however I noticed that this TikTok video came from a content creator, Sarina, who actually is a psychology student at an Ivy League school that claims her tiktok account is meant to educate others (she even names her account ‚Äúpsychandeducation‚Äù). I have been in psychiatric units and I‚Äôve shared with the staff, and on one occasion with a group of psychology interns, many embarrassing stories and details about my trauma; mainly because I trusted they would reserve all judgment and trusted that what I said and did in the psychiatric unit would be kept confidential. So seeing her (Sarina) violate patient confidentiality and that trust patients have with their mental health treatment team in psych units made me upset enough to leave a comment. She should not violate patient-provider confidentiality and judge a patient, especially one that is a child, with severe mental illness. Not to mention going on to share their experience for tens of thousands of strangers to laugh at on the internet. In my comment, I said ‚Äúbut they‚Äôre mentally Ill smh‚Äù and several people liked it. She responded that she actually has no judgment and this was meant for education (I‚Äôm not going to bother explaining how that‚Äôs just not the case). Anyway, I ended up commenting back: ‚ÄúI have no judgment for this at all!‚Äù *proceeds to judge a child with severe mental illness for tiktok clout* She deleted my comment and blocked me less than a second later. I guess she knew I was right and needed to silence me. So much for wanting to educate, huh? Let‚Äôs put an end to tiktok content creators in the psych field exploiting mentally ill patients under the guise of ‚Äúeducation‚Äù. I‚Äôm tired of it."

At the end of the day yes, we all do have to eventually toughen it out and get over it, but when you try your best to move on every day exerting excruciating amount of effort. it just gets me mad because that's not how it works at all, if you can then that's good but for me, I've tried to and it doesn't work that easily for me. mental illness is real, you cant toughen out everything just like in one go in a day, pain doesn't subside like that, when you've experienced trauma. It just really makes me mad when people say that its really insensitive when I'm trying my best, I know that's what I have to do. its like people don't think that you have to move on but I do, I try to \"get over it\" everyday adopting new mindset's and being excited about the future and working on myself constantly every day to the point where its my main priority no work just working on my mental health.

I compare my friends/follower count, my pics, etc. The worse culprit is instagram. Nothing makes me feel as bad as instagram. O don't have a lot of follwets on other social media accounts either but nothing makes me feel worse then instagram. Whenever I make a post, I feel bad about myself afterwards because I never get a lot of likes and comments. Also, I think my pictures are trash compared to everyone's and I always think I look fat in my pictures. Another very disheartening aspect of instagram is followers. I dont have a lot of followers (just 63) and I feep like a loser because people who post less than i do have 10 times the amount of likes I get. Everyone I know has more followers than me. I feel like such a loser whenever I use the app."

    "text": "Does anyone else feel like their entire personality depends on who they're talking to or what they're doing? It's almost like I don't have my own personality. A few years ago, I'd constantly try to get people to describe me; Part of it was because I wanted to get people to compliment me, but now that I think about it, I think most of it was because I wanted people to tell me what they saw in me because I didn't know how to describe myself or who I even was. If I'm talking to someone, I'll end up: - Mirroring their personality. I start acting like them, obviously. My values are entirely based off of theirs. You know how people can actually start showing traits (positive or negative) of something if they read about it enough, even if they didn't show any signs of it before? That, but with people. - Becoming what they 'need'. Someone is in a very bad mental state? All of my energy is dedicated to helping them, even if it destroys my mental health in the process, and my personality entirely becomes \"therapist friend who helps everyone.\" This sort of relates to the next point. - Becoming what they describe me as, which is based off of the previous two points. If they describe me as confident, that's how I'll act around them. It doesn't feel like I'm repressing my 'true self', but I never feel like myself either. I don't consciously do any of this. I end up thinking my personality has always been the way it is at the time, with the exception of how I feel now; I can only think about mental illness and all of my problems. It's helpful for becoming aware of what I do and why, but I don't exactly enjoy only being able to think about everything that's wrong with me. If I'm not talking to people, then my personality sometimes bases itself off of whatever my current interest is. It becomes everything I talk about, all I can think about, and I start to plan my future around it. My personality literally becomes \"I like this thing a lot. This is what I'm passionate about.\" I don't know how to feel like myself when I don't know who that even is. Being bored is one of my least favorite feelings because I feel so lost. I don't care about not having a distraction from my thoughts, it's just that I'm forced to deal with the emptiness being so much stronger. I can't distract myself from the feeling of not knowing who I am. I never realized just how much all of this bothers me until now. In fact, it feels like one of the biggest problems for me, although I have no clue what to do about it. I was just wondering if anyone else feels the same way."

But just because you‚Äôre sad for two weeks doesn‚Äôt make you depressed. Stop trying to be ‚Äòtrendy‚Äô with your mental illnesses. Anyone who actually has a mental illness will tell you they wish they didn‚Äôt have it and they definitely don‚Äôt go out of their way (taking and sharing pictures of themselves crying) to share their mental illnesses."

You see posts all over the internet and organizations organizing fundraisers for mental health and all that jazz, but no one really helps you out when you need it.

My government funding is soon out and I recently made a big move, but I haven't been remotely happy since I got here. I had a mental breakdown that I am still not the same from, and my anxiety is so bad I literally can't perform basic tasks 99% of the time. I've never been this sick in my life and I have absolutely no help other than the occasional \"it'll get better.\" You truly don't understand how people with mental illness feel until you go through it and I hope everyone else finds the help they need but I don't think there's any hope left for me."

A few years ago I started to really struggle with anxiety surrounding all things cyber-security related.

Im thankful for my therapist but they have been the only significant help ive gotten for my mental health and healing from trauma besides drugs. It makes me wish there were better options and that we all had our basic needs met in a significant way without having to jump through hoops, struggle alone or go into debt. I sometimes imagine what this country would be like if the government actually cared about people more than money. If they actually invested more in people and environment than the military and big business. If the people here had their basic needs met, a good education and didn‚Äôt have to struggle so much to survive, I dont think mental health would be nearly as big of an issue. think about it, if you had what you needed: a safe space that you own, healthcare without dealing with insurance, a supportive community, a healthy environment, a purpose, healthy food and all the resources you need to live well, would we be as ‚Äòill‚Äô as we are? If you didn‚Äôt have to be rich to get socialized services, would you be happier and more successful? I like to imagine sometimes what a good alternative to psych hospitals and anti depressants would be like but if this country took care of its people better, I think that would ‚Äútreat the cause rather than just the symptoms.‚Äù I realize what im describing is more socialism. I just think having compassion and caring for your people is more important than money or power because what are we without each other or support? lonely, angry and afraid. I also partly blame the rich for taking advantage of the ingrained individualism in this country encouraging the poor to fight amongst each other so we don‚Äôt turn that anger on ‚Äòthem‚Äô. what do y‚Äôall think? what would you change about this country so that the people benefit from it? you can respond if you weren‚Äôt born in the US."

I feel like I could've been a better friend, he talked me off the ledge when I was ready to jump. I blame myself for not being able to do the same for him. I can't seem to find closure, I keep looking at our last conversation and I keep blaming myself for not seeing it sooner. For not realizing that he was done. I've fought the same battle and have stepped away from suicide more times than I can count and one of those times he was there talking me down and helping me through. How could I not save him?.."

    "text": "I grew up with a mentally ill parents. Mother had depression and bipolar and and father had rage issues. Terrible together. Absolutely terrible. I hated my father until I was in my 20s. Ever since I could remember he would scream and yell and break shit like a 2 year old having a meltdown over everything. If my mother didn't have the house clean or if my mother didn't make peas with supper or if the Christmas tree wouldn't stand up straight. My mother slept all day and would forget to feed me. I was 4 I believe, I know I wasnt in school yet. My mother would get up to send my brother to school and then would go back to bed. I would use the VCR and watch Cinderella over and over and over. If I got hungry I'd go get stuff out of the fridge. I would cry if I got to hungry and I couldn't find anything to eat. I'd cry and cry and try to wake my mother to get up and she wouldn't. She would moan and fall back to sleep. I remember crying so much and I had my Cinderella shoes on (my mothers heals) and I was kicking and my shoe flew off my foot and smashed the window. My mother finally got up and cried she knew my dad was gonna be mad. I remember her hugging me and saying sorry. My brother and i were left alone all the time from age 5 yr old and my brother was 8 and up. My mom worked nights and my dad worked days. When my mother left for work my father would wait til she left and then left us home by our selves. I dont know if he was to cheap to get a babysitter or just didnt care. My mom would get home at midnight and found us alone and scared and crying. We lived in an old house beside a cemetery. So every noise scared us. CPS was called once maybe more but they only came to my house once and never came back. My mom cried all the time. She also lied and stole all the time and would take me with her when she stole and if she got caught she would lie...ill fast forward this. Years later when I was 12 my parents came into my bedroom and told me my dad was leaving. I never felt so happy. He was so mean towards my mother. I thought finally we can live happily. Boys was I wrong. I didnt know about metal illness. My mother couldn't cope. My dad took care of everything and did everything for her and worked so hard to keep food on the table. But as a kid I didnt see that. I saw just how mean he was all the time. My mother got very sick.. I didnt know what was going on. She started not eating except cottage cheese and jam. I tired getting her to eat other foods and she wouldn't. Then she started pretending to choke her self and buried our dishes in the snow in our yard. Also thought she was giving birth to my older brother. She started to forget who I was but always knew who my father was the great love of her life and my brother. She started to get jealous and mean towards me. One time I got home from school and I heard her screaming and I ran into her room and she called me nurse and asked me to help her. Said the baby is coming. Then pissed in her bed and said where's the baby. Where is the baby. And passed out. I called 911. She was in and out of the hospital. They kept sending her home saying nothing is wrong with her. I tried to get her to sign a child tax cheque so I could go get us (my mom, brother and I) groceries. And she flipped out said I gave her a pen that didn't work and that I must work for the government and punched me in the face. My mother never hit me before. Never. I then ran into my room crying and and she came after me. I was lucky i had a lock on my door. I called my father to come get me that something is wrong with my mother as she was pounding on my door trying to get into hurt me. My older brother lived in the basement and I barely saw him. He use to be so mean to me growing up I didnt bother with him much. It got to the point that I couldn't stay in the house with my mother and my friend mom let me stay with her. Finally after my mom lost so much weigh and was so so sick that my bother called my mothers sisters and they came down and the doctors finally took it seriously and she was admitted for mental health. My father moved back into the house and I moved back home. My father still a Workaholic so I barely saw him but he wasn't angry anymore. There was no more yelling and he took us to go see our mother at the hospital. It was terrifying. Ill never forget the smell of the hospital and the people looked like zombies. My mother talked so fast and her eyes looked so different and she talked about God about how God heard her and is saving her and she showed me something she made in work shop out of clay. How she was in darkness in this cave and God opened up the cave and gave her light again. Fast forward to 6 months she was in the hospital. I was home with 2 of my girl friends and my mother came in the door and I said mom! I felt so happy to see her and she wouldn't even look at me like I didnt exist and she packed her things and left. Did not even say a word to me. Just left. I felt something change inside me that day. I was so hurt. My mother wasn't well but the love she gave me and showed me as a child when I got hurt or when I was having a bad day. It was like she could make it better. She ended up moving back in months later and it she was different. It was like she didn't care about anything, blamed everyone for her problems, if she got caught in a lie she would blame it on something else. She didn't seem to care about anything other then money and stuff. She started filling our house with stuff. So much stuff and clothes. My dad stayed and his rage came back... I got sexual assaulted when I was 13 and my girl friend saved me from him going further with me. She heard me crying and telling him to stop... I never felt so scared. He made me look him in the eyes and kept telling me he wouldn't make me do anything I didnt want to do.... and i kept telling him i didnt want to do anything. He wouldn't listen. Tears running down my face as he was doing what he wanted. My friend and her bf came running over and said what the hell are you doing. He let go of me and I ran. I ran so fast. I didnt know where to go but to just run..... I felt like I had no one to talk to. I got so depressed my friend told the guidance counselor at school what happen and she brought me in and then called the police. When my father picked me up from the police station. He said \"boys don't know what to do now a days\" and my mother cried and said nothing. It still bothers me to this day what my father said to me. Didnt ask if I was alright or he'd kill the bastard. He should of just said nothing like my mother instead of what he said.... We went to court and bc it was his first offense he got probation and had to stay 500 feet away from me. Boys seem to scared to even come near me. People at school didnt believe me. I heard them say how can you get sexual assaulted. She must of did something. I ended up quitting school. My father got a job in away and moved out again when I was 17. I got a job at subway and moved out with my boyfriend. Who would cheat on me and I would always take him back. I went back to school and got my high school diploma and I applied for college. I took my boyfriend with me to the city and left the town.... should have left him in the town. He brought me down so much. He quit his job while I was in school so we lived off on my student loans and I worked and I couldn't take the stress I quit school and focused on working. He signed up for the military. My father bought all the things he needed on the list to go. And he left. Bf brother and preganet girlfriend move in with me to our small one bedroom apartment. (Thats another story...) anyways ill fast forward this too. We end up breaking up a year after the military. I was completely heart broken. I thought he was the one but I knew i couldn't take him back this time. I made a list of everything I ever wanted to try and do. I move in with my brother and then one by one I was checking off my list and I started to feel better and started having confidence and loving life. I went to 5 different dance glasses aweek, gym, I bought a pink bike. I always wanted a pink bike so I went out and got it for my self. I went para sailing, white water rafting, tidel bore rafting , zip lining and going out with gf, getting my hair done monthly and read alot more books. Its funny the things you give up about your self when your in the wrong relationship. My ex ended up wanting me back 9 months later and I told him I'm never taking him back and that its over for good. I never felt so good to be rid of him. I wanted to have a relationship with my parents again so I got my license and would go home to visit and help them out and take them to doctors appointment etc we grew close. My dad went to therapy got help with his anger. My mother was always obsessed with my father. Wanted him back would cry all the time and then get really mean. It was an everyday thing. She wanted to know everything about him. Even when she had a boyfriend she would obsessed over my dad. It was so sad. I would tell her she has to move on and live a happy life. But its like she couldn't. My brother stopped talking to our mother. Couldn't deal with the toxic relationship. I met the love of my life from a different province when I was 26 and 2 years after we met we moved in together and started a family. My mother got sick and had to get a bag when my first born was 5 months old. Her mental state declining saying horrible things about me and everyone. Very racist and Homophobic said terrible things to the nurses and doctors. She was pissed i couldn't take care of her. But I had a 5 month old and breastfeeding, I couldnt do much. She got home care but her house was so full of stuff they couldn't make it in past the livingroom. fast forward again... My mother now imagines things, thinks people are following her, thinks her phones and house is tapped and says the most outrageous things to me. Said she had sex with her Psychiatrist but now thinks he's someone else bc his hair looks different or if he goes to the bathroom his twin comes out. Still obsessed over my father and they haven been together in 20 years. If i don't answer her calls she will call my inlaws say terrible horrible things that aren't true about me. She thinks I traveller's the world. I always say I wish that was true. But now this past year she started calling me awful names. I wont repeat but it is awful. And says if I dont let her talk to the children she'll call CPS on me and my job and my inlaws and say these hurtful and untrue things about me. I went to her family doctor and tried to get power of attorney but it was her Psychiatrist is the one who deemed her capable! She lives in a house that is so disgusting filled with food, clothes, cat shit, and is imagining things but says she is capable. He wont even meet with me or our family.... I dont understand how he can deem her capable when he doesn't know the truth. Nor seems to care about the truth. Her family doctor, seniors safety and peoples protections are all involved and agree my mother needs help. But said they can't help people who don't want to be helped. Unless I get power of attorney. My father use to pay her Alimony but retired so she has no income except old age pension. She doesn't have enough for food and bills. I try and help with food but everytime I gave her money she would go out and buy stuff not food. She is so mean towards me and I know its her mental health and I tried so hard to help her. But I get so depressed when I talk to her. I feel anxiety when I feel like I should go see her or talk to her. My kids are scared of her. Everyone in my family has disowned my mother even her church bc my mother would say the meanest untruthful things. She is alone. Makes me feel guilty she is alone. But she does it to her self. I tried so hard to get her help. Unsure what to do now. Growing up no one asked if I was ever ok. No one talked to me about mental health. I honestly hate talking to her. But she's my mother so I feel guilty not talking to her bc I know she's sick. I know she was physically abused and emotionally abused by her mother and by my father. I know she is ill. But sometimes I feel alone in knowing what to do and I dont want history to repeat its self. I dont want to be like either one of my parents.. I know it must be so hard being mentally ill. Its also so hard living with someone being mentally ill. When she has good days I end up crying. Brings me back to when I was little and how loving and caring she was. It doesn't last tho. No one talks about the kids who live or lived with mentally ill parents and how to cope. Thank you all for the kind messages and hugs üôÇ"

Both of them would regularly use slurs around me yet at the same time tell me don‚Äôt say it.

The only thing I can‚Äôt come to terms with is this: at 21 I started university and after 1 year I had to quit due my depression, mdd and eating disorder. Now I‚Äôm 26 and I‚Äôm ready to go back finish and get my degree but I just keep beating myself up and thinking how great it would have been if I didn‚Äôt quit, I would have already graduated and gotten a job or smth. I just can‚Äôt come to terms to forgive myself and keep thinking about everything I could have done in those 6 years and that makes me resentful towards myself.

    "text": "I kind of want to just... let myself fall into a deep depression. I don't really understand it. It's heavy and comforting. That sadness that seems to come from within your chest and then wrap itself around you until you become cocooned inside it. You don't want to move, eat, go anywhere, do anything, see anyone. Lay in bed for days. Leave dishes everywhere, stay in the same clothes for days, don't answer your phone. Let your plants die, pile up dirty clothes. It sucks. But it's warm and comforting like a nostalgia from years ago, like a weighted blanket you can't keep off of you. I used to have these kinds of episodes. On smaller scales, not super long periods of time, but I was dealing with this. Since then I've spend each and every day just clawing my way out of that blanket; forcing open the cocoon. Fight to keep myself functional, as a productive human being. I can't afford to go into a depression like this. I have a job, a life. But damnit if I'm not inclined to take a week or 2 off of work so I can fall into this again. Depression sucks. Don't get me wrong. I hate being in the middle of a delicious meal and then getting hit with a pang of deep sadness so strong that I have absolutely zero appetite and have to throw that great food away. At my worst I didn't eat for days. I tried to claw myself from that blanket and I just couldn't. That strength of fight I need to keep myself afloat just wasn't there. I would make myself bowls of top ramen just to take 2 bites of it, almost vomit, and pour it out. These episodes really suck. But they're almost addictive. I have a hard time talking about this in therapy. I say that I almost want to be depressed, and they look at me like I'm crazy. Or worse, they'd gently, almost unintelligibly, raise an eyebrow and give a soft \"huh\" before writing something down on their clipboard. I hate the clipboard. But I can't be the only one. It reminds me of times when my problems were different. Not better or worse, but different. When I would get joy out of laying in bed at 4 am, watching tim Burton movies and cutting (as edgy as that sounds- i only did it once). It made me incredibly sad, yes, but there's a lingering happiness behind just letting all that fight go and being awash in a thick, dark, warm cloud. And I can't help but wonder if I'm alone in this feeling."

    "text": "young hot ebony teen gets railed by mental illnesses ü§™üôÑ aight so boom.... as of 2017 i've consistently stayed fucked up. and i know what you're thinking \"drugs üôÑ\" no bitch; i'm mentally ill. if you name it, i've probably got it. ADD, BPD, anxiety, depression and OCD. a four for four happy hormone deficient combo slapped right onto the brain of an 18yr old teen. we been knew that i had ADD cuz i can't get a grasp on the ontario learning curriculum for shit. i've spent most of my school years in the \"troubled kids\" rooms doodling on test papers and devouring fantasy books for as long as i can remember. sure i'm smart (don't think for a second i'm not) but taking in mass amounts of information is hard, my brain needs time to sift and sort and organize. regardless, the ADD was nothing new. then i had my first depressive episode. that tore through me like laxative in coffee and i got diagnosed with that as well. (the depression, not cosmic diarrhea) therapy was the only option at the time because i was a youngin' and taking pills was NOTTT the vibe. naturally, as a lower-middle class family, we couldn't afford the long term counselling so i braved it like my ENFP self usually did and decided to battle it head on with fun activities and regular communication with my mum and doctor. that lasted a month. i underestimated the disease....a mistake i wish i could go back and fix. fast forward past a few traumatic events and the list just began to grow. i became well aquatinted with OCD and BPD (borderline personality disorder). from there it spiralled. after becoming somewhat accustomed to the royal ass fucking the cesspool of diseases had to offer me, i spent the rest of my junior/senior years smoking weed to help ease the crushing weight of the trauma and symptoms. skipping class, coming home late, spending money i didn't have, ignoring every warning sign my body offered me by staying high as a military fighter jet from the second i woke up to when i would eventually pass out from the 6 sometimes 7 bowl hits. even then, in my sleep, i was tormented by nightmares. i never allowed myself to process what i was feeling and how it was affecting me....outside of the few hours at night i'd lay awake silently screaming and crying. for help. for release. for an end. i felt alone. my mind was no longer my kingdom. and my body, which had been recently violated at that time, was peeling away from the fragile bones within them. i was lonely, desperate for a release, hungry for love that would heal me, frantically searching for a way out of the grave i had been digging for myself the moment i decided to i was no longer worthy of anything besides misfortune. my mother (god bless her) can read me like a sticky note, but there was only so much she could do and to my fault, only so much of my pain that i would let her see. at that point i had began to run. from my problems, from my home where the eyes of my loved ones widened with worry any time i'd skip a meal or look up at them with sunken features. i spent days away at my friends house, and when her and i weren't smoking our problems away, i hollowed in my bedroom..... the girl i once knew, bright and cheerful, smiling at anyone who would look her way, loving loud, laughing freely, devouring book after book, drawing abstract art and conjuring the most elaborate stories with that stunning imagination of hers, was gone. in her place, stands me. i don't know who i am anymore if i'm being honest. only who i used to be....and anytime i try to seek out a new definition for the person i've become and want to be it only adds insult to injury. each hug, word of praise, \"you're so strong\" \"we love you\" \"you'll get through this\" \"you'll be okay\" feels like road salt packed on the giant festering wound in my chest. the back of my skull hangs open, my brain unaccustomed to the fresh air of positive reinforcement and unconditional love. i feel naked now. vulnerable. afraid of myself and what it means to carry this weight any longer. since quarantine's started i've then been diagnosed with anxiety after a horrible panic attack that sent me to the hospital. i sit for hours trembling in blankets, staring at the paint of my living room walls struggling to focus on something....ANYTHING that'll stop the cold pulsing in my head and jaw. my heart skips beats, they say the palpitations are normal but each one is a stinging reminder of my existence and how expendable it is at the hands of these...things. crawling, slithering, groping through the crevasses of my brain. killing me softly. my body, unfortunately, answers to their calls. the symptoms are normal apparently, and i think that's what scares me the most because i feel like i'm dying every second of the day and i'm expected to live like that. like this. i stopped smoking and that's been a journey in of it self lmao. but more than the desperation to fling myself into the frozen atlantic ocean, weighted down by my despair and a bag of bricks, i'm eager for peace and fulfillment. for change and a future that i have a say in....not the depression or BPD or anxiety. sigh.... i don't know where i thought i was going with this. i lost the motivation to continue typing a while ago but it feels nice to vent :) i've got a consultation with a therapist in a few days and a call with my doctor after that. i'm hoping i can find excitement in the forward movement.... i want to get better. i want to be better for myself. i don't wanna die but i don't wanna live like this anymore (word to bea miller :p) i'm hoping i can learn about my new self and how to love her the same way i loved younger me. i'll name this new era of self improvement and discovery \"the age of circes' bloom\" in honour of the firsts book i've read since this whole fiasco started. Circe by Madeline Miller. and like the herbs in Circe, daughter of Helios and witch of Aiaia's lush garden; i will bloom. i will flourish. i will grow."

I don't even get upset or sad over this stuff, it's a total involuntary response. I hate it. I'm certain it's linked to childhood trauma about not being good enough and always getting yelled at. The best solution I have is to breath and distract myself. However, when people ask what's wrong or why I'm crying it makes it worse! I am emotionally stronger then I was when I was younger but the moment I start tearing up people take me less seriously. Does anyone else have this issue? Some advice or just validation will help. I feel like I'm crazy because of it. Quick edit: I appreciate everyone's comments and it helped just hearing your own stories. Thank you! Sorry that I'm not responding to messages or anything.

They said you would have stayed in bed all day and never came here if you were really depressed. And in the end they said I had nothing and I was complaining over nothing. One of them talked to me for like 10mins then gave me a 1 hour test on a fucking laptop in another room and went home without me knowing. Never went to therapy again. It was either tgat or being diagnosed without listening to me talk then prescribed meds without knowing anything about me. I was suicidal, I failed an entire semester at college, i had a car accident, got rejected in a span of 3 months and they said I had no mental illness. This was 4-5 years ago. Now I'm still depressed and anxious and having panic attacks every now and then and a bunch of other things I know they will say I dont have.

    "text": "Already mentally ill, working at a psychiatric hospital, what happened today may have traumatized me beyond what I imagined I would experience at work TW: Suicide attempt, inpatient treatment So I'm diagnosed with Bipolar 1 Disorder, PTSD and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. I'm also an alcoholic but I'm not getting that diagnosed. I work in mental health care because it's my life and my love and my calling. I have for 3 years, it's everything to me. Generally I can deal with very horrible things okay, like I'll get drunk or have a panic attack but I'll be okay in a couple of days. But today something new happened. For context, I'm currently working at a psychiatric hospital (which I've done before) but in the adolescent unit for the first time in my career, starting about a month ago. It's been really hard but I love it. I love working with adolescents, I'm 27 and look/act 22 (according to myself and multiple patients) so that probably helps. But I just adore them. Today a patient, a 14yo girl, was so suicidal she was on 1:1 observation. We had to physically hold her this morning to keep her from bashing her head into the wall during a suicide attempt. Tonight it got worse. She tried every way to hurt herself (I really don't care to describe it all). It took 5 of us women (men trigger her even if they're within 3ft of her) to hold her down. Several women switched out but I stayed on her legs for the full 40 minutes because I had built a good relationship with her and I figured out how to position my body so that even when she pushed and kicked, she wouldn't hit my bones or anything. Unfortunately 2 of the other staff members didn't do the same. She kept screaming, begging to die. I've had those thoughts and screamed those things myself. Word for word. Every time a man came within 3ft of her, she SHRIEKED. And the supervisor/RN during that particular shift was a man, so he had to be at least somewhat nearby. I don't think I will ever forget this as long as I live. Her screams and shrieks, holding her as gently as I could, knowing that she is fucking FOURTEEN and in this kufh pain. I mean I was too at her age, but I know that's so far beyond normal there are no words for it. And I'm so scared that I'm now going to have a panic attack whenever someone screams. When I got home, a kid in the parking lot of my apartment who was playing catch with another kid screamed and I dropped to the ground and covered my ears. All I could hear was her screams. I can take this for a month. But what if this is another whole cause of ptsd coming on? I'm not leaving this career. I'm not leaving them, ever. But I'm scared that this may do some serious damage to me when I already don't have my own illnesses under control."

He always scolds me, swears at me for everything and anything. It's so exhausting. I thought he did it bc he cared, that he wanted the best for me but no. He screams at me all the time. How useless I am, how I'm a disappointment. It was fine til I was young, 8 or something, I really liked him back then. But then as I grew older, he started making me feel more and more unwanted. He's pretty pedophilistic too. I'll be sleeping and he'll kiss my cheek, right besides my lips and WON'T stop til I wake up and push him away. I wear shorts in my house usually, and he'll make these comments, \"I want to lick you\", \"I'll bite you on your ass\" and it makes me really uncomfortable. When I was 11 something, he said, \"I wanna give you raspberries on your stomach\" and then he scooted right over and did it, I tried to move and push him off but he's way stronger than I'll ever be. I don't know what to do, who to tell. He makes me want to kill myself. I want to live, but I don't want to live with him, I don't want to be near him. It's been going on for about 8 years now. I really hate this. When I was younger, I had written this letter to my mom saying that I was sorry for all she had to go through, he'd fight with her a lot too. I apologized and said that I should've never been born, that it was my fault for being alive. That man made me regret being alive at 9 years. I want help, I really do. But I can't get it. I want to go away, with my mom but I can't. Everytime an argument starts between whoever, it always ends him bashing me and swearing at me. I really want to kill myself, at least I won't have to see him again."

    "text": "How common is it for people to fantasize/dream about disappearing from their current life and starting a new life somewhere else? I'm 21 and as far back as I can remember (at least starting in, like, 6th grade), I'd semi-frequently fantasize about dropping everything in my current life, changing my name, and moving somewhere far away and starting a new life. I've noticed that in the past couple of weeks/months, I've been doing this way more frequently than previously. Basically, as the title asked, I'm wondering how common this is and if there's really kind of connection with mental health. Idk if the fantasizing about living another life thing is just a me thing or if it's a sort of common thing. For reference, I've been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. I apologize if asking this kind of question/ranty kind of post isn't allowed. (I hope I flaired it properly too)"
