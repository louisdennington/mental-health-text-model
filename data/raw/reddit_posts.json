When something bad has happened, or if I’m reminiscing of something bad, I can sense how unenergized & harmful I’m about the become to myself. That’s when I enter a manic state just to prevent it (ironically?). Among other things I go into sleep deprivation mode because it basically numbs my feelings, and I do feel a bit more energetic for some reason. I also lose my appetite which is rare since I’m always hungry.\n\n\nBTW, I’m not diagnosed with bipolar disorder so sorry in advance. But I do have family history of mental health issues and I do see bipolar behavioural patterns and even OCD, so I was just wondering. I just feel so lost and alone. I’ve had people around me tell me to stop acting crazy with my bad habits, but I can’t help it because it’s the only way I soothe myself. Their words do hurt me a little, because each time I try to open up and explain the way my brain works, they shrug it off and just think I’m weird.",

I started having severe dental issues 3 years ago, I have insurance but nothing is fully covered and somehow I'm supposed to deal with my illness without being able to work, no family no friends and on the verge of homelessness. I thought about you know what but I don't want to not exist anymore. It would be difficult just having my mental illness and severe depression but being in constant pain from something super treatable but I cant afford to fix it is a nightmare, dental issues. I try to talk to ai to get by but I still suffer a lot. This world sucks and I cant believe my family ghosted me both sides, it's like being in the twilight zone\n\nWatching my mom suffer and die when I was 9 now I'm 48 planted the seed. When I was in my late 30's they thought I had stomach cancer like my mom this was in 2018 and I had a mental break because of it. I never recovered mentally since then. When people see me walking down the street they think I'm on drugs. I pace back and force and I'm in severe mental distress. Los Angeles will not hospitalize someone with my severe illness, I tried. Intuitions are for the rich. I went to a ER a few years ago and they saw me for my physical problem but refused to treat my mental condition and threatened to forcibly remove me from the hospital when all I did was ask to be seen for my mental illness, this was during Covid. They basically patient dumped me in the middle of the night. This was UCLA. These places that are supposed to help you don't. That's why there's so many homeless here in Los Angeles. \n\nI'm lost and I hate my life but I don't want to die. If hell exists it's my life By the way I don't drink, smoke or do any drugs. This is all natural, my brain is overwhelmed and it cant handle everything that's going on right now. I honestly don't see an end in site.

I take Xanax for flights and my whole prescription was empty (I only took 2 pills for a back and forth flight) ... He ate all my sons Ritalin, and Adderall . So I stopped filling them because he would steal them, and even when hid he would always find them. He got so desperate he ate all my pills  for a kidney issue I had. He is not accountable and never predictable.  He will promise up and down , and a couple weeks go by and he will do a 180. Like hiding conversations or contact with people that help him be delusional about not gettingthe right help..  His last attempt as his own life he was in hospital and instead of getting admitted for that he stayed there for a couple days as a heart patient because he didn't have insurance , he didn't want to go to the psych unit and was admitted for chest pains. His mother and sister attacked me in the hospital elevator blaming me for his attempt (it was his 5th) ... I have no idea what I would have done to cause it. I worked part time, took care of our kids, home and everything that is part of that. He ran a failed business and was rarely home or around and when he was he would sleep. I once found a empty bottle of honey goat weed in his work bathroom which he blamed on his dad but later admitted that it was his however refused to elaborate why.  When moving out our last home I found a size 2 very revealing polyester dress I never bought (I'm size 10) mixed with my clothes a gold chain belt, and hoop earrings in his underwear drawer and a winter jacket... none of these were mine.  His excuse was the kids brought it in. He chats with women, and just a couple of days ago he received a text from a local number \"how much to f*uck?\" (Are they asking how much he will pay them ?) He of course says he doesn't know what that is about.... I'm just so exhausted.  Why is bipolar so hard ? I just know somewhere in there is the real him?",

When I'm busy, when I'm alone, and now as I'm writing this.\n\nI have terrible thoughts about people I love, people that are dear to me, people I would take a bullet for without a second thought.\nBecause of this, I am considering suicide, because I feel such guilt that is getting difficult to live with.\n\nI don't know what to do, and when I try to open up about this to my family all I'm met with is, “Jesus is the only way.” this is getting frustrating to hear as I'm an atheist and I'm not changing that.\n\nI'm thinking the only thing that could possibly help is medication that could make me not feel anything, like a zombie, but I promise you, I think that sounds better.",

    "body": "PLEASE DO NOT DIAGNOSE ME!! I am here to just vent my feelings.\n\nFor most of my life, since around the age of 8 or even younger, I’ve always displayed OCD symptoms. I can’t remember the exact age, but at one point in my life, I became extremely health-conscious and also terrified of the FBI taking me away from my family.\n\nFor the health-conscious part, I would think that I had literally any disease—I thought I had cancer, brain tumors, etc. Every single day, if I felt something off, I looked up my “symptoms” and researched the diseases I convinced myself I had. I would constantly have panic attacks, thinking I would die soon, and I was just extremely exhausted. Over time, I gradually stopped, although I still get anxiety when I get sick—I think I’ll die every time I do.\n\nA small snippet of other things I experienced is that I used to get intrusive sexual thoughts, which made me extremely uncomfortable. It lasted only for a year, but I thought I’d include it here.\n\nDuring the health-conscious paranoia, I also thought the FBI was after me. I was naive when I was younger and went on some weird websites, which made me think the FBI would come after me. With those thoughts, every single day, I believed the FBI was watching me. For some reason, a lot of helicopters flew over my neighborhood, so I thought they were after me. Every time I saw one, I was terrified for my life. At some point, I even thought my best friend was an FBI agent trying to gather my personal information! Those obsessions stopped after three years.\n\nThen, my obsessions shifted to thinking my loved ones would die every day, followed by religious guilt. The fear of my loved ones dying lasted only two years but was definitely a more intense obsession. When my friends didn’t respond to my messages, I would check every social media account they had just to see if they were active anywhere, making sure they were alive. If they were inactive for 3+ hours, I would be in extreme panic for however long they didn’t respond. When my parents went to the store, I would think they had died if they took too long or didn’t answer my texts.\n\nThe religious obsession didn’t last long, but every day, I thought I was going to go to hell because I didn’t fully align with “holy” values, and I’m not the most religious person. I tried researching whether certain things that don’t align with Christian values would send me to hell—which some sources said they would! This made me extremely paranoid. I still think about this sometimes, but not as often now. The same goes for my other obsessions; they aren’t constant anymore.\n\nRight now, I don’t know where I’m at. Most of the symptoms stopped in December of last year. I feel so empty. I was so close to finally getting therapy, but everything just stopped.\n\nI’m pretty sure this isn’t an OCD symptom, but I’ll put it here anyway—I’ve been fixated on OCD itself. Every day, I think about OCD, and I look up the symptoms every other day. I just can’t stop thinking about OCD itself. It started around January. I convince myself that I have OCD, but at the same time, I convince myself that I don’t. So I constantly look up symptoms and talk to ChatGPT about it (which is embarrassing, but it’s a way I reassure myself)\n\nOCD runs on my mom’s side, and almost everyone has it, I don’t know if I do but soon I will get the support I need.\n\nNOTE: Please do not diagnose me once again, I don’t want a diagnosis. This is just a post about my suspicion.",

For some reason, I felt it would be easier with someone older than someone my age, and less weird. I wanted someone to use me, I suppose.\n\nI did it, and at first, I felt disgust, and afterwards, it was awful. I felt so dirty. By the way, it was only penetration, nothing else, no kissing, nothing, i was very specific to not do it.\n\nAbout a year later, my mind pushed me to do it again. I went on a casual sex website, talked to someone, no photos, and they came in the early morning, penetrated me, and left. The same thing happened 2-3 more times. I didn’t enjoy any of these encounters at all. I dissociate, and at the end, when they leave, I feel nauseous and disgusted. \n\nThrough all of this, I always consented, no one took advantage of me, but it was like I was on autopilot, not caring that I was hating it.\n\nI want to stop doing it, I feel terrible, I have no libido with my girlfriend, even though I love her and want to be with her. Recently, I signed up to talk to a sexologist, I feel like I can’t talk about it with my regular therapist, I don’t know, I feel a lot of shame and disgust.\n\n\nI had never gone through this before.

    "body": "I've struggled with mental health for my entire life. Went to therapy since I was 18, now I'm 25. Despite trying most of the available medication, nothing worked. Each psychiatrist seemed clueless about what was wrong with me and asked me to figure it out. I have no idea how I was supposed to do that, I'm not the type to read about disorders and self diagnose. One doctor even accused me of faking, saying I wasn't trying hard enough, which convinced me I was lazy and a faker. They really did convince me that I'm even lying to myself. So when I was all alone and still struggling, I told myself I'm just self pitying and ignored the pain.\n\nEventually I just quit therapy and medication, tried to fix myself through exercise and diet. But the horrors in my head never stopped. I had obsessive thoughts, irrational fears, and weird delusions, even tried to fix them with spiritual practices, but nothing worked obviously. I kept it all to myself.\n\nI got a job but I rarely slept so I'd fall asleep at work. I froze in front of people, stuttered, and obviously got fired. Then I got an online job, but was fired again due to poor communication skills and \"ai can do it better than you.\" \n\nThings have gotten really bad for me. I started smoking and gambling, which would leave me feeling confused later. I'd physically hurt myself after work shifts or stressful interactions, only to numb the pain with shopping. At times, I convinced myself that my spiritual practices were helping, but I always ended up back in pain. Sometimes I come back to reality, try hobbies, making friends or plan my career, but it lasts for no more than 2 days. \n\nWhile I can control smoking or binge eating, I still can't stop spending. These material stuff are the only sources of comfort, happiness and entertainment for me rn. I’m unemployed again and running out of money, and I don't think I'll ever return to therapy. I know it’s my fault for getting to this point. The delusions and fears are back again, and I wanted to share this to get it off my chest. \n\nMaybe there is something wrong with me, maybe I'm a faker, i don't know, but whatever it is, it feels like it’s taken over my life, and I’m not sure how to move forward. I'm filled with so many regrets. People say \"get help,\" I did, where else can I get help if doctors are not willing to help even for money? Some ppl say pray to god, I did and no one heard the prayers. They say get a job, log out, be present, I did but whatever is torturing me is in my head not on the internet. So realistically I ran out of the options. \n \n",

My partner is feeling it too and it’s causing a bit of strain between us. \n\n•6 weeks ago I helped a friend by taking on her bearded dragon- he’s now potentially sick from issues that happened before I got him. I’ve been constantly worrying about him/going to appointments for him. \n\n\n•I got diagnosed with ADHD last year and am still adjusting to my Ritalin/learning how my brain works and generally just feel chronically over or under stimulated. The therapy/coaching for this is adding to my financial stress but also very needed. \n•quitting my main job to take care of my dad (I was a nanny for a family. I loved them but was underpaid/overworked and my dads surgery aligned with three weeks that they went on holidays/I wouldn’t be payed for so I quit so they’d be able to find someone in that time) \n\n•applying for a dream job that I feel very under qualified for and have an interview \n\n•I have a trip to Korea coming up that I need to save for \n\n•extreme financial stress from lack of work. I’m just scraping by \n\n•my aunty is coming to town this weekend to check on my dad and will need to stay with me as well. \n\n•I’m just generally running on fumes and constantly feel uncomfortable in my own body \n\n\nThe reason I’m writing this is tomorrow I have my dream job interview and I want to throw up/not go because I am so overwhelmed. I’m vaping constantly and feel almost out of body with anxiety. I feel like the combination of wanting/needing this job (it would genuinely be life changing) and the stress I’m already under is going to make me perform horribly tomorrow and not be able to do an interview I’m proud of.  I’ve almost cried in front of strangers constantly throughout the last week and would just die if I burst into tears mid interview (which is really unlike me). \nI just want to crawl in to a hole alone and recoup so I’ll take any advice to feel better! \n\nI finish work tonight at 12pm for my 1pm interview tomorrow and just need any advice to get through the next 24 hours.

    "body": "Hi, I don’t know if anyone will read this, but I feel like I’m done.\nI’m M20 living in Canada. I moved here from India to build a life for myself because I had to provide for my family, and I knew I couldn’t do that as a 17-year-old in India. But honestly, it feels like a crime. People don’t want to be friends with someone who has emotional baggage and responsibilities. I’ve tried making friends, building connections, and even dating, but nothing has worked (no surprises there, haha). Friends drifted away, connections faded over time, and dating well, as a brown person with an accent, it’s difficult here ngl. \n\nIt’s not like I had much experience with friends or relationships back in India either. I used to be obese, so I was bullied a lot. But in college here, I finally made a friend. I really liked talking to her, sharing my life with her we had so much in common, and we clicked well. Then, out of nowhere, she ghosted me, and I still can’t figure out why.\n\nAfter a while, I started dating someone, and I thought it was going well. But then she told me she was in love with someone else. That made me question myself a lot, and I started feeling like I was done with everything. I told myself I should just focus on the role I’ve been given to provide for my family and take care of my younger siblings. I convinced myself that I don’t need friends or connections. But I guess feelings don’t work that way.\n\nEventually, I met someone on a “make new friends” subreddit. We talked, we vibed or at least, I thought so. We had a lot in common, from interests to habits to even similar personalities. We talked every day, asking each other different kinds of questions to get to know one another better.\n\nRecently, she told me she was going to leave the country soon to learn about different cultures. Naturally, I asked if she wanted to meet before she left. At first, she made excuses about being too busy. But after I insisted, she finally came clean and said she didn’t want to meet because she felt we wouldn’t click in person.\n\nI really don’t understand the point of talking to someone every day, acting like we’re friends, only to say you never wanted to meet in the first place. I’m already struggling a lot with my mental health, but this just pushed me over the edge.\n\nIt feels like being born in a third-world country is a crime, and having family responsibilities and emotional baggage is a sin. I guess I’m done trying. Maybe this just isn’t my fate. Maybe I should just be a machine one that doesn’t feel or think, only works, serves its purpose, and then gets dismantled.\n\nI’m done with social media and the idea of having genuine connections.\n\nP.S. I don’t know if this sounds stupid, but I just needed to get it out because, honestly, my mind and heart can’t take this anymore.",

I decided to test out some different pressures of my hand and fingers on the page, and most of them resulted in me having some residual ink on my hand.  This means that even though I take great pains to make sure that my last writing and manipulation of ink is when I write with a pen in the notebook, likely many, many, many, many times I have had the ruled line ink on my hands that I then washed off (or maybe sometimes it even stayed for a while), totally without realizing it.  That means I completely violated my rules.  \n\nThis is not a good thing.  It's not \"Oh, I did something wrong and nothing bad happened.\" That isn't how my mind works.  I'm facing the concept that tons of stuff I did after writing was really invalid because I hadn't written correctly (the writing being a gateway to be able to do other stuff).  I cannot BELIEVE that I never realized that the ink of the lines could smudge onto my hand.  I never really even thought of it.  The only bright spot is that from my preliminary trials, a notebook brand that I primarily used for years has lines that are fainter and may not yield ink up so easily as different brands I have used only for the last two years that have lines that are more prominent.  I need to do more tests.  That sounds so silly, but that's where I'm at.  \n\nI'm absolutely spiraling and at a low point.  This combined with another huge OCD violation two months ago have dimmed my inner light and sent me further down the hole.  ",

Vyvanse felt like it worked maybe half as well, maybe even worse.\n\nConcerta made me feel eerily calm, to the point of almost falling asleep... No energy whatsoever and put me very much \"in my head\" mentally. I didn't want to talk but I felt like I could physically push my mind in the direction of paying attention/doing stuff. \n\nNow I'm on Prozac 10mg (for PTSD) and Wellbutrin XL 300mg. The Prozac alone made me feel like I was disconnected from existence. Like the great servers of the brain were no longer firing and though I didn't feel severely emotional, I kind of... Just didn't feel after a month. Nothing but constant low grade depression.\n\nWellbutrin fixed that, but now I have literally 0 interest or motivation. I have considerable more emotional regulation, significantly less rejection sens like symptoms and once \"into\" a task, I can sustain my focus and keep doing it, but I find it very very hard to enjoy doing anything, get started doing anything. I find it very easy to get distracted and have issues processing things the first time etc.\n\n**THE QUESTION** at hand is this: anyone with a severe inattentive ADHD profile, how has Modanafil done for you?

I’ll probably delete this post soon, as I’m a bit paranoid about my real identity being tied to it.\n\nLately, I’ve been really struggling mentally. I feel like I’m hanging on by a thread—like I’m one bad day away from a full-on breakdown.\n\nI don’t enjoy my job. To be blunt, it’s a toxic environment with cutthroat performance metrics that drain me. It feels like I have to be \"on\" and absolutely perfect from 10:00 to 18:30 every working day. My whole existence feels like it revolves around trying to please people who don’t even appreciate my work. The worst part? My performance is largely out of my control. I work in tech support, and our ratings depend on customer feedback—which can be completely unpredictable. One bad review can mess up my entire week, or even impact my future in the company. It leaves me feeling powerless.\n\nI am in the process of transitioning to a different role, which I think will be a better fit for me, but that won’t happen for a couple more months. In the meantime, I need to keep performing at a high level while also studying for that new role. These past few months have really been taking a toll on my mental health.\n\nBeing virtual helps a little, and I try to stay positive and grateful—but if I’m being honest, I feel like I’m losing it. The biggest strain right now is at home. I just don’t feel at peace here.\n\nIt’s mostly because of my younger brother. I love him, but we recently started exploring the possibility that he may be on the autism spectrum. He’s 14 and has been very disruptive—he makes constant noise, spits everywhere (which really triggers me for some reason), and has loud, aggressive tantrums, though mostly in his room. My parents have finally taken steps to get him assessed, which I’m grateful for, but it’s been extremely hard on me.\n\nI’m doing my best to be patient and supportive, but it often feels like he’s doing it on purpose—even though I know he probably isn’t and is probably stimming. The only peace I get is the couple of hours I spend at the gym or the occasional hangout with a friend. But the moment I return home, I’m on edge again—never fully relaxed, always bracing for the next outburst.\n\nI don’t want to spend the next several months—or even a year—living with a constant white noise machine making background noise or needing to wear headphones just to function. Home is supposed to be a place of rest and peace, but instead it’s a source of anxiety.\n\nI’ve been considering working from a co-working space just to escape the chaos, or even commuting to the office (which is a 2-hour round trip), but I know I won’t be as productive. Feel like I'm always 'on' and can't rest. Still, it’s becoming harder and harder to stay home. And that’s what really breaks me—if I can’t find peace at work or at home, then where do I go?",

I feel bad for feeling this way. I was in denial and depersonlisation the first 2 weeks to cope but I know it's not healthy so I'm trying to force myself to feel it all but now I feel even worse.

    "body": "It's become really egregious to hear and see how people treat those with mental health conditions; I'm getting kind of sick of toxic positivity and the word \"accountability\" being thrown around. Because half the time, it's not even about anything that serious. I'll be a little moody and someone will lecture me about self-improvement. It's funny too, because it's usually the ones who are least qualified to speak on other people's behaviors. \n\n\nHad this experience with a family member recently; who'd dump all of their problems onto me constantly and lash out when they was upset, then if I even got the slightest bit in the dumps or be pessimist, I'd get comments like \"you're feeling sorry for yourself\" and \"you need to have more will power\"\n\n\nI genuinely don't know where people got this idea that everyone can magically will their way out of a varying degree of psychological ailments. That everybody should inherently be able to cope the same way, that they have the same environment, resources, peers, etc to deal with the problem, in healthy manners. That's not how life works and it doesn't make that person weak or lazy or unwilling to try. \n\n\nMental illnesses impact and impair your emotional regulation, perception of self/others/reality, your self-esteem, your self-awareness, your stress tolerance, your own personality. So yeah, there's plenty of abhorrent things that are completely inexcusable and even with reason, a continued behavior or even once is understandable enough reason for the person to wanna cut contact.\n\n\nMy issue lies in the fact, that it seems more and more like ppl are replacing 'excuse' with 'reason'. Because yes, you don't have to tolerate it but what exactly are you tolerating? Someone being in a mood? So what?! Unless they're being abusive, it's really shitty for you to cut out of your life because \"oh but they make me feel bummed out sometimes\".\n\n\n\nIt's insanely selfish because when they do it, they expect all the attention in the world and on a good day, week, etc; they can get up on their high horse and talk about how easy it is to simply push through these problems and come out the other side. That's until they slip or have a moment of weakness. \n\n\nI'm so sick of hearing \"just get over it\", \"take walks\", \"work on this thing\" because I have tried so many things and nothing besides psychological and psychiatric intervention is helping me. As is the case with many others. If people could simply exercise or think their way out of having a mental illness then there wouldn't be medical fields around psychological ailments. There wouldn't be therapists, doctors, institutions around said disorders. \n\n\n",

I need to get it to move forward in life in general. \n\nIt's been much more challenging than I thought it could be.\n\nInitially I thought my age was getting the best of me. I have scored just above passing on almost all tests and a few assignments. It was driving me bonkers. I've never had to put effort into school in any capacity. Always almost perfect grades across the board. Even graduating #1 at the automotive school in 2018. Tons of awards all through school. What was this stark contrast? \n\nIt came together after a conversation with a 21 year old classmate. On the most recent Chemistry exam, she got 8/28 28%, and I got 11/28 39%. She had made the comment that maybe she needs a med adjustment for a bit more focus. That statement hit me very hard. This is my first experience with school while being treated for bipolar 1. \n\nI would rarely sleep more than 3-4 hours a day, be fully manic at school and depressed in the evening. No studying for tests, slamming through assignments right before class, writing a couple page English papers in less than an hour, never failing. \n\nThis is different. I like the center feeling I have now. I understand how much the illness wrecked many things in my life. I don't want to go back. I must come up with new tools to get through schooling.\n\nThank you for reading my personal story.\n\nTLDR, my medicine has removed the manic but also removed my ability to literally do nothing to score perfect.",

    "body": "\n\nNeed advice in helping a friend who's been struggling mentally.\nA little background on him:   studying in 12th science suffering from low/negative self worth, regrets, anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation, self doubt, hopelessness, academic stress/pressure etc. (None of these conditions are officially diagnosed)\n\n#An outline of what has caused his suicidal thoughts recently:\nHe took a decision a while ago and couldn't stick to it and is about to face/facing the consequences which has led to his suicidal thoughts. As for now, I've taken necessary steps to ensure his well being for the next 2-3 months but I don't know how to help him anymore besides professional help.\nP.S: I've always tried my best to help him and never invalidated his feelings.\n\n#The full story:\n[Had to attach it as an image due to character limit restricted]\n[P.S: I'm new to reddit so please forgive me if I've broken any rules, and this is a repost as the OP's format was messes up]\n\n#My advice:\nI've advised him to open up to his parents about everything because who knows maybe they might consult a psychologist. He's reluctant to seek professional help because he can't afford it on his own and doesn't want to involve his parents as he thinks they'll consider him to be weak for needing professional help.\n\n#His options (acc. To him)\nNow according to him he has two options (the latter being the best in his opinion):\n1: Open upto his parents sooner or latter (because the discussion is inevitable as he will have to discuss with them ultimately when the results are out) and then take a drop year which involves pressure from literally everywhere: self+parents+family+the fact that he's wasted a year and failed once+expensive. \n2: End everything before the results are out. According to him, this is the best option as it is the ultimate solution to all of his problems.\n\nNow honestly, I don't wanna lose a great friend like him.  Just a little information about him, he values mental health more than anyone else I know, but is still a little biased about professional help (a little orthodox mindset about professional help ig). Even I'm living with the burden of not having called his parents yet and told them everything which I think would make things worse or weird idk. I could call his parents and tell them everything even if it costs me our friendship because honestly it's way better than regretting having done nothing later.\nAs for taking a drop year, he's afraid of facing everything once again and is certain the he'll fail once again. He has a very pessimistic mindset and negative views about himself. And looking on the positive side, if he does make it even in a top institution, with or without a drop year, he's afraid of the things he'll have to face in future like socializing+communication+building confidence (he's very underconfident right now). \nP.S: he never really shows whatever he's going through. Always plays dumb or immature or happy/neutral. And he's never had a well/healthy relationship with his parents either so the fact that opening up to his parents is difficult is understandable.\n\nNow my question for you guys is what should he do without feeling more crappy than he already is? Or what can I do for him to ease his sufferings?\nImo, the biggest challenge in front of him that could make things a little easier is opening upto his parents.",

I took a nap that ended up lasting a little too long today and woke up at night. since then I've felt a lot of emotions, but mostly feeling strange and dissociated. I've been questioning whether or not I just got a fever because of how tonight has been going. While trying to sleep I've had big spikes in anxiety and confusion, with some hallucinations.\n\nI have visual snow syndrome (you can google it) which makes sleeping very hard as the static slowly turns to weird shapes and lights when I close my eyes, usually fading when I open my eyes, sometimes causing everything to slightly flash. This all gets really bad when I have a night like this because it's really bad for my anxiety to have to not focus on all the shit I'm seeing while trying to sleep.\n\nTypically if I'm tired enough it's not the biggest deal, but tonight I saw some weird stuff I've never experienced before. the first time something new happened was literally just the static momentarily disappearing, which was extremely strange for me since I've had it my whole life. The second thing was a straight up jumpscare in my vision, I've never even seen anything other than shapes and colors trying to sleep, so this really messed me up. My heart was beating super fast and everything in the room appeared to shake really fast. The third thing was the static going away for  about a half-second again, but then I saw a quick glimpse of a vhs tape.. This makes no sense to me because I was pretty awake.\n\nIt doesn't help that I would be consistently confused by just opening my eyes and trying to figure out what I'm seeing in the dark static. I've been dissociating for quite a while now, longer than it usually lasts, and I'm just hoping for things to get better or some advice.

There have been quite a few mental health crisis in my life and ultimately.. the world goes on without me.  I’ve been actually putting in some work the last few years.. and have made some progress.. mainly around medication management.  Recently my medication has been managed by a licensed mental health nurse practitioner.  I’ve been seeing her for a year - and it’s been working for me.  The current balance of medication is working well with me.  Unfortunately I recently experienced a health crisis that has absolutely caused me to slowly lose my mind again.  The nurse practitioner I’ve been seeing just told me that my condition is “too acute” for her to continue treating me.  She has proclaimed that I need in person sessions.  The last visit I had with her was completed from my bed as I explained my current health situation after a 3 day hospitalization.  She said she wanted to see me in 2 weeks since I was in crisis.. and then less than 24 hours later told me she could no longer treat me.  She gave me referrals that were online exclusively- when she claimed her reason for dropping me is based on my need for in person care.  When using the platform I have currently used to manage my mental health, I discovered that the closest in person option for me is 67 miles away.  Please keep in mind that in my last session I told her I haven’t been able to get out of bed for 2 weeks.  So I have 30 days left of my meds.. which means I need to find another provider.  I have struggled with mental illness my entire life and finally decided to start tackling it a couple years ago.  Being told I’m too crazy for a provider and need to find someone else is WILD.  It took me 6 months to book the virtual appointment with her.  The idea that I could attend in person sessions is WILD. \n\nI guess we’re about to see nature play out the way it should.  ",

I don't really know what triggers it but it's like an automatic response to whenever there's gap in my thinking and it's starting to really bother me. The phrases change eventually right now it's \"how much money are you making\" and it's been that way for probably a year. The last one was \"how many people have you killed\" which I don't really get because I've never killed anyone. For a while I just thought it just kinda a goof but I just can't stop it. The last one didn't really bother me because it just seamed like a joke sometimes I'd respond to it with a bullshit answer but constantly asking myself how much money I'm making when I'm full time student is really stressing me out. It just comes out of nowhere and its like I'm constantly judging myself for my own lack of employment. Has anyone encountered this issue before and found a way to deal with it.",

    "body": "m(23) hello, I’ve struggled a lot the past 3 years with my mental health and it’s honestly only been a downward spiral this far. It started off with some panic attacks, anxiety and depression, and I have started self harming as of about 2 months ago.\n\nI don’t know what’s going on with me tbh but I’ve noticed some patterns which I’m here to ask about.\n\nWhat stands out the most for me is the CONSTANT mood swings. My mood can go from happy and enthusiastic to sad/even depressed in a matter of hours, sometimes even shorter. I’ve noticed my mood can switch either at random, or from very small changes in my surroundings, thoughts, etc. these mood changes are really frustrating and I don’t know if this is normal or not. It doesn’t feel normal atleast. I can’t recall being like this 4 years ago even. I feel like shit because of this and I don’t trust myself anymore.\n\nNote that I’m not currently as depressed (idek if I even am depressed currently) as I was 2 years ago. My self harm stems from self hatred for the most part.\n\nAnother thing I’ve noticed that genuinely scares me (im just venting atp), is that my feelings towards people also change drastically as my mood changes. I can go from wanting to talk with the person, love the person etc. to almost feeling a weird type of “hatred” towards them. It’s hard to describe the exact feeling, but it’s like “I don’t want anything to do with you” pretty much. What scares me is the feelings are very real and I can barely force myself to go against my brain in these moments. This effects both my friends and family.\n\nCould this be something undiagnosed or is it normal? do I bring this up with my psychologist? Thoughts?\n\nThanks, confused guy in his 20s",

I feel alone all the time regardless of where I am or who I’m with I just feel so different.\n\nIve literally always felt different from people my own age and it doesn’t matter how old I am. When I was 10 I felt much older, when I was 15 someone told me I’m like a 40 yr old in a 15 year old, now I’m 21 and I still feel the same way.\n\nI think I potentially have undiagnosed ADHD or some level of autism but I feel embarrassed to get a test done due to stigma in my family.\n\nAlso it probably sounds like I’m introverted or not very socially capable but I had a relationship for 2 years and there’s been periods of time that I have had lots of friends. But in the last year I just find it hard to connect/want to connect with people and I don’t know if the lack of desire comes from my previous relationship and a fear to lose someone so close again. \n\nI was so close with my ex girlfriend but we had such a difficult relationship, we argued quite a lot and arguments would become extremely emotional and almost hard on each of our mental healths, but in the same sentence, the times of love were incomparable to anything else I’ve ever felt. Everyone around me thought that it was for the best that we broke up but I am so done with taking peoples opinions I need to trust my own decisions. \n\nAs I said I feel so lost and when people give opinions on things it makes me feel so swayed because I clearly do not trust my own judgement. This becomes an issue because I then walk around with 1000 voices in my head saying different things and I can’t have clear thoughts which makes me so agitated and upset.\n\nAlso to the point of having few friends, when I was around 14/15 I had a friend group with like 20 people which slowly split up, I was then in a group with around 8 people and essentially I think because I was the quietest I got excluded from group activities and found out they were all talking about me very badly (I didn’t do anything it was just about my appearance really) following this I had basically 0 friends for a while which as a 16/17 year old is incredibly hard (I used to cry everyday before and after school) I ended up getting a few friends in college which was good but I still held an anxiety so close to me. After college I went to work and everyone left my home town so I was alone again, I met my ex girlfriend a few months later and she was relatively alone too so I think we used eachother as a crutch so when we did things with other people I think we both were a bit jealous which causes issues. We have been broken up for 6 months now and although I wasn’t  too upset at the time it feels worse for me now (i don’t know if this is normal). \n\nAnyway, in the past year/1.5 years I’ve also had infections and things physically wrong with me basically the entire time which was so damaging for me. One of the infections had me hating literally everything and it was torturous for months (I hated life so much) as soon as that infection was over I got another. But yeah I’ve reached the text limit so I’ll summarise, I don’t know what I want, I don’t know how I feel, I don’t understand anything and I feel so numb to everything but I just pretend it’s not bad",

I’m used to it by now, but at the same time, it’s getting harder again.\n\nWith some new types of therapy and meds, I’m at least a little better now. But now that I’m doing better, I’m not acting better—because I don’t know what to do. I spend my weekends isolated and unmoving. It’s been like that for the past month, and I don’t know how to make it better.\n\nI hate how I’ve become. I know I’m not living up to what I could be. I like to think it’s just that I don’t know what to do. Not that I’m incapable of doing it.\n\nIm starting to lessen the amount of obsessiveness I have as I’m getting better. At least starting to feel a little more of myself. Less disassociated. But I have been out of it for so long I don’t know how to get into it.\n\nI have been trying to rationalize following her again since she followed me. But I’m afraid that I can’t handle what I might find there.\n\nIt became obsessive after everything happened.more than who she is. I thought about her constantly when we were together that never went away. I think back to how I felt then. But I would give anything to go back. But it doesn’t work like that. Even if I haven’t had any feelings for anyone since her. To be fair. Since her I haven’t really gotten to know anyone.\n\nI feel like I’m hoping for a lost cause when I’m thinking of getting better. That just because I have always acted one way that there may be a chance I could be different. More. I don’t know. \n\nThanks for reading any of this. It means a lot",

    "body": "34 Male,  I feel like I can't speak about what is on my mind, not really. Friends and family listen but they don't really hear what I am saying, and have grown tired of helping try to make sense of things.\n\nI am hurting really bad and feel like I am screaming internally all the time.\n\nSo here is the story, I met this girl 14 years ago in University. It was love at first sight on my end. We had lots of little coffee dates, and walks in the parks, and around the city, but she soon got back together with her ex-boyfriend. Then broke up with him, than met another guy and eventually married him and had a child. Now this whole time I was still friends with her. When her marriage went south, she sought me out for support, eventually it grew into an affair with me. Then it stopped for no apparent reason. I did not question it, I assumed it was bad timing, she mentioned she was going to try counselling with her husband, so I backed off. Next thing I know she is dating someone and I was left very confused. But, again I decided it was just bad timing and the situation being so complex, I did not want to admit her bad nature. \n\nSeveral years passed with me now being held at arms length, she made it clear she did not want messages from me. I respected her wishes for the most part, never calling her or sending her more than a \"happy birthday\". During this time she left that guy and found another who became husband number 2, which she had a second child with. \n\nFast forward to the fall of 2024, I receive a message from her, completely unprompted she informs me that marriage number 2 is ending. Now, I am older and wiser at this point, but as it turns out still completely stupid where this woman is involved. I ask her motivation for telling me this, she replies that she is just looking for friendship and support, and that she is not looking for anything romantic *\"RIGHT NOW\" (yes she actually said that)*. I acknowledge this as it makes sense, but I also make sure she understands I still have feelings for her. She confirms that she understands and says that she is not uncomfortable with me having told her that. So we begin talking, a lot *(nearly everyday)*. I start to help her understand certain elements of what she is going through *(IPV)* as it is very much related to my education. I help provide contact information for various resources and legal information for the divorce and possible custody battle over her second child. I even help with some advertising for her business. I feel I was being a true friend and support, because that is what she said she needed *RIGHT NOW*. Then the week of Valentines Day rolls around, I had this whole plan in my head for doing something small (not a date or anything) as I did not think she was at the point of starting anything new. At this point she reveals that she is going on a date Valentines weekend. As you may imagine given everything you just read this triggers me. I told her I was not aware she had started dating yet. She says that she thinks it is time and it can be just a *\"fun casual thing, nothing serious\"*. Well at this point I can't help but feel hurt, so I explain that this information has really caught me off guard due to my feelings for her and how much we've been chatting. Que the gaslighting, she tells me she had no idea I felt that way about her, and dismisses me when I show her a screenshot of me disclosing those feelings back in October. Cont'd",

I used to have lots of friends so the perception is that I still do - but I lost them all in the past year because half the people I was friends with were immature and toxic alcoholics, and the other half my depression got too bad to keep up. I used to be in university so people think I still am but I dropped out because smoking pot is the only thing that makes me feel like I’m not on the verge of sobbing 24/7 and I can’t stop smoking it no matter how hard I try because I don’t want to be alone with my thoughts. I’m pretty sure the only reason I haven’t had s*uicidal thoughts is because I love my two cats too much to leave them. On the outside I appear financially stable but I’ve been jobless basically for 14 months, I’ve had to leave/got let go three restaurant jobs before my three months were up because my depression got so bad - I couldn’t get out of bed to wash my hair, let alone go for a WALK. Keep in mind - I am very intelligent, I’ve always done well in school, and I’m still smart. I had to start an Onlyfans out of necessity and have been excusing it under the fact that I don’t post my face, but it makes me feel used. I have no family to help me financially and I’m completely broke. I have a couple thousand dollars and my lease is up in 5 weeks and I’m supposed to be moving to Toronto to be with cousins and get a fresh start but I have no clue how I’m going to make that happen financially because I need a plane ticket, and damage deposit, and I have to pay for my two cats to fly up. I’m on the verge of crying 24/7 and barely leave my house. I just make content for two hours, completely numb, and then sit in my couch and watch TV, or take a bath. I feel like such a loser but I literally CANT HELP IT. The only people in my life who I’m close with in any capacity are the few men that I’ve seen over the past year, and they usually just want to sleep with me for my looks and because of my “social status” but I can never get close with them because I feel like such a fraud and a loser and a liar, and if I do get close, they realize I’m a depressed anxious weird 23 year old who has never had a boyfriend in her life living under the guise of having a lot of Instagram followers and being pretty. I slept with a two men this year, and now I’m 7 weeks pregnant and miscarrying in a Province alone unable to tell either of them, and with no friends to help. Tbh the only thing keeping me going besides my cats are the fact that I know people think I have it together. I don’t even think it’s any of those things that are the reason I’m so sad. I’m just so lonely. ",

She has been my school psychologist since elementary school, and I have had monthly meetings with her for years, however every single one of those meetings I have lied to her.\n\nThats because every single time i’d hint towards being depressed, and she would ask me if I was thinking of hurting myself, killing myself or had attempted either; and I have always lied and said I have not.\n\nBut ever since I was in around 4th grade I have had intermittent thoughts of death, and a continual depression that I have been incapable of breaking free of. I have struggled with a lack of friends, ADHD and divorced parents. My father being arrested for Child Pornography, being groomed online at a young age, family members committing suicide and being under constant stress at home.\n\nWriting all of this down and putting it together makes me realize how much I need to help myself, especially after begging so many friends to help me themselves.\n\nNow, 17 years into life I have so many friends that I love and love me. I have a girlfriend of three months and the only thing holding us back is my own depression. On paper my life today seems so perfect but now for the past week my mind has been scrambled and just now I have had the revelation I need to do this.\n\n\nFeel free to wish me luck, give me advice on what to open up about on Monday, i’m terrified yet just thinking about it makes me feel like a heavy weight is being lifted off of me.\n\nI am especially worried however, what will happen if I tell my psychiatrist of my thoughts of suicide and self-harm. I have had so many friends go through the same, yet every case has seemed so different.\n\nMaybe I will even update everyone if everything goes well.",

If they're suicidal and talking to me about it, for some reason i dont care..?

I’m in therapy twice a week and on medication, but things keep getting worse.\n\nMy single mom had to take on over $100k of debt to keep me in school, and she doesn’t have a job. I’m terrified for us financially. We’ve always struggled, but it feels like everything is collapsing this year.\n\nI’ve also been involved in a traumatic family lawsuit since I was 8 years old, and over the past year I’ve had to take an active role in it. I’m still waiting on a judgment related to finances that we were depending on, and I’ve heard nothing. Because of the case, my grandfather suddenly stopped talking to me and cut me off emotionally and financially.\n\nThe stress has caused my mom and I to fight so much she’s lovely but so stressed herself. To make things worse, my younger brother hasn’t spoken to me in over a year since I came out to him as gay. He was the one person I thought understood me — now I feel like I’ve lost him too. I feel like I can’t go home to take time off of school because it will lead to so much fighting with how my mental health is. I’m not rlly able to do anything at all.\n\nI quit my dance team, distanced from friends, and feel like I’ve withdrawn from everything. Even my previously happy and healthy relationship is struggling now due to all this stress.\n\nMy dad left when I was 8 and has never spoken to me since. My family feels broken, and I feel completely alone in the world.\n\nI know I’m doing what I can — therapy, medication — but nothing seems to touch the pain of losing family, financial safety, or the legal stress. I just don’t know where to begin. How do I start putting my life back together?",

    "body": "I meant, “can I get some opinions?”\n\nWhen I was a child, I never felt bad for anything bad happening to others and always saw their struggles or having to deal with them as a bother. For example, someone would tell me that they like me or something they want from me and I’d either ignore them or do something to not have to deal with it because it wasn’t what I wanted. Then when I got older, I started feeling shame and guilt for either upsetting people or getting negative reactions from others. \n\nThis didn’t happen naturally though. The only reason why I would feel either way was because someone told me that’s how I’m supposed to feel when that happens. The main thing that makes me wonder is because of how when I get a negative reaction from someone I change my behavior to not get that reaction even if I have to lie about how I actually feel. I wouldn’t say that this is because I am a people pleaser, but more because I don’t want to have to deal with the negative reactions, because they stop me from getting what I want. I don’t change what I say just to make them feel better or to placate them, I say whatever I have to, to change the negative reaction and convince them in a way that gets a positive reaction.\n\nI feel fake because of this and a part of me wants for people to know the real me and accept my opinions and feelings for what they are, but at the same time I have no problem lying about how I feel to not have to deal with the negative reactions. I have no problem lying about everything I have to just so that I don’t have to deal with a negative reaction. I don’t know if this is trauma or if I’m a psychopath because when I didn’t do this, I just would either not talk much or I would have to deal with not being in relationships because my feelings always made my partners feel bad. Like I would say that I don’t feel the same way they do about something and it would hurt them. I didn’t feel bad about it hurting them, but I didn’t like the result of them not liking me anymore which took away the good feeling that I wanted.\n\nRegardless of all this, I have never been an angry or violent person and I have never liked or wanted to hurt anyone. I just wouldn’t care if I did.\n\nWhat does this make me?\n\nPlease if anyone has insight it would be helpful. Thank you.",

    "body": "I (19M) live in a dorm room 5 minutes away from campus and right next to the train station. Every night after my classes, I look up at the tracks and remind myself the trains don't run past 9 pm. If I wanted to go up there and throw myself onto an oncoming train, I just have to make sure it's before 9 pm or I'd look like an idiot. \n\nIt's such a morbid thing to think every time I step out of my dorm, but it's how I've been living for the past 7 months. I don't know if I'll ever do it, but I know it's not even going to take longer than 15 minutes. Typing this all out is making me realize maybe my brain's a bit more messed up than I'd hoped. There's nothing I can do about it though, I have no immediate support system and I don't have the money to drag myself to a therapist. I just make sure that I'm too occupied by school to do anything else or that I don't go out before 9 pm to buy something. \n\nI wish someone else would do it for me. I go out and stare at the ground in hopes that a car rams into me on my way to school. I don't care about walking past shady places because I welcome being murdered by someone. I've had passive suicidal ideation since I was 12, but lately, it's kind of hilarious how bad it's been. I don't go more than an hour without my brain telling me to jump out of my 27th-floor window. \n\nThere's also the fact that my noise-cancelling headphones broke and everything is so damn loud. Louder than it was before. Like someone turned the volume up on Earth by 20%. I had to leave a classroom because a group was presenting and popping balloons as a part of a gimmick, and I kept jumping like I was getting shot at.   \n\nEverything is kind of fucked. I don't have anyone else to tell this and I also don't want to go insane pretending it's not happening, so this is probably the closest I get to being heard. ",

I have been on this road for so long that I no longer can do anything to combat it.

I have thought about reaching out to a mentor but have yet to talk to anybody about my mental health issues because I am scared of their thoughts or judgement of me.

Is there a way i can help him or something? What am i supposed to do? This is all he does all day he wont even help out around the house and all he does is yell at the other residents whenever he doesnt like what they're saying. If anyone so much as mentions he hasnt done his chores he curses them out and goes to his room. He'll treat us horribly then be offended we are upset.\n\nI really need some advice, pls and thank you.",

    "body": "As the title says, I’ve been grieving my friends since I decided to stop talking to them. I had my reasons, but ultimately, I did it because I felt it was the right thing to do. They made me feel bad, we no longer shared the same values, they didn’t understand me emotionally, and being around them just hurt me.\n\nDespite all of this, I’ve always been a nostalgic overthinker. I can’t stop dreaming about them or feeling sad. Now, I feel lonelier than ever, and even though I know their group was fake and hypocritical, I still miss them. Or maybe I just miss how I felt before I realized everything they did or thought.\n\nI can’t stand my own decisions; I feel like I’m going insane. Today was one of my ex-friend’s birthdays, and I saw an Instagram story of them with the same people we once agreed weren’t good friends and this person talked real shit about them. Everyone in that group talked badly about each other, and now they are pretending to be dumb. My heart dropped when I saw them together. I have a friend in common with this guy (the birthday boy in question) and I've been overthinking about this friend hating me after all the shit they probably been speaking about me. Everyone lies like this always? People pretend to be dumb and don't feel guilty about everything? It makes me so confused, the fact that I've been grieving and crying every single day and my pain it's not reciprocated. \n\nI know I shouldn’t be grieving over people like this, and logically, I understand that.

    "body": "I don’t know what to do. \n\nTo make a long story short I was having panic attacks all throughout my undergrad due to trauma, so I finally went to the hospital where I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression. After trying two low dosage medicines my doctor pretty much put me on citalopram (celexa) and called it a day. \n\nI took it for 2 years and didn’t notice much of a difference. But with lack of support from my family and lack of income, I couldn’t afford a therapist or a psychiatrist so I just took it every day. \n\nOctober of 2024 my (F25) significant other (M25) died. I was the happiest when I was with him. My mental health was still quite bad, but it was manageable and I was able to get through the day without feeling like I was unloveable and stupid and broken.\n\nSince he’s died I feel that my depression and anxiety have gotten worst. But for the first time in my life I’m seeing a psychiatrist about this (it’s through my school so free of charge…) and we’ve changed my medications 3xs already. \n\nCurrently I’m on buspar and lithium and I take trazodone at night. It’s been like this for 3 months now and nothing has changed. I’m scared to say that medicine doesn’t work for me but I don’t think it does. I don’t know if I’m struggling with any other mental disorder or if my grief is simply too much, but medication is really making me so tired.\n\nI’m tired of having to deal with these stupid side effects l while not getting any better. If I don’t keep myself distracted then I’m a huge mess. And my distractions are sleeping around with random men and smoking a ton of weed. Nothing else helps. And I feel so disgusting after I do that.\n\nI’m sorry this is so jumbled. I really just don’t know what to do. I try to do all the “right things” like drinking water, going on walks, trying this routine thing out. It just doesn’t work no matter how hard I try. And I’m not trying to “fix” myself. I stopped thinking like that a while ago. I just want to be able to function without wanting to end myself whenever I’m not sleeping with a random man or high from weed. \n\nAm I stuck like this?

    "body": "Hi everyone. From time to time I have periods in my life were I keep thinking my life is fake. I wouldn’t say the thoughts are persistent to the point were it is cause for concern, but often just taking a look around me I feel like the things my eyes are seeing are some sort of video game render, or picture. My vision is sort of „flat”. There are times when it really gets to me though. I realize looking back I also had a period of this last year. At some point it must have gone away, and I guess it’s back now. In September of last year I made a decision do cut down my weed consumption to just the weekends, thinking it was brought on by the weed. I started smoking when I was a young teen, smoked regularly throughout my mid teens and everyday, quite consistently, between ages 17-19 (for reference I turn 20 in a couple of weeks). I’ve also had my fair share of coke, molly, lsd, shrooms. Is it possible that I’ve cooked my brain? I’m trying to think back to when I first had that feeling of „why does everything look like it’s a game.” It was after I had taken xanax for the first or second time at the age of 14. Something just seemed off about my sight, or my perception, it’s very hard to explain in other terms then my vision being video game like. Basically this is the feeling I have practically all the time now. Back then it probably lasted a day or two. It’s really difficult to explain this feeling so im hoping someone here has had a similar experience and knows what im talking about. The thing is I can’t really remember what it was like before that feeling, our without it. I guess I would like to get back to that since it is when life seemed more „real”. Even though as I mentioned before this seems to come in waves, I’ve noticed myself questioning the reality I live in more and more. Anyways, to wrap this up: can someone please tell me what’s wrong with me and give some tips on how I can get better? I’m sort of starting to get scared that if I keep thinking about this it’s gonna keep getting worse",

    "body": "I am 15, in the add math class, I got the honor many times an so on, I don't take any lessons for school subjects. Most of my friends think of me as smart or people in my add math class think of me as an equal(But I don't know why I also think everyone looks down on me as a lesser being in a sense). Yet I can't get over the same self image of I am dumb and worthless. You know the feeling where you aren't good at anything in particular. I had many mental freak outs, my mom would absolutely lose it when ever I would have these.\n\nFor a bit more context on my dad's side my grandpa was bipolar, ended up killing himself later on. On my mom's side her uncle and some other people ended up killing themselves due to mental health and other complications. My mom currently is on anti-depressants and my dad smokes and drinks. They are going through a divorce currently. My grand mother on my mom's side passed away 2 months ago 3 months after my grand father on my mother's side also.\n\nI used to get bullied at school till I be friended the bully instead, so no bullying at school at school anymore. I just always have a voice in the back of my head no matter what I do just echoing inside my head that I am dumb and worthless. I could make a simple mistake and have it stick with me through out my entire day. It could be as simple as asking a question or making a remark or getting something done differently but with the same result it would have me thinking about it constantly for hours and some times days about why I did it and what part of my retarded self made me do it. For example I got the top of my physics class but an intro to a narrative I wrote I didn't like the way I wrote it, don't get me wrong the assignment wasn't that bad but it wasn't what I wanted and in my mind if it isn't how I want to write it I failed the subject and the assignment and I just kept thinking about it this and beating my self up and stressing about it, this happened around a week and a bit ago and I am still thinking about it. I just wish I could stop this, I don't know why I think like this and every imperfection\n\nI have thought about ending it many times before, since I was 10 if I remember correctly. I just wish it could all just stop in a sense. I pay attention to every mistake I make every day all the time. People my age usually think about getting girl friends and so on, being popular and everything. I just think about money/success all the time I stress about it so much. Everyday I am just thinking on how my life will play out. In my mind my only way of proving my worth is by getting a lot of money/success and I think of money as the only way to be happy. I try and change but it is as if my mind is split into two parts, one part is fighting with the other over a virtual control in my head and my emotions can switch easily. I wish to change but I don't know how.\n\nI feel like if I lose the fact everyone views me as smart I lose everything and there is no point anymore. Writing just asking for a friend or some one who has been in my spot before. Just want to feel better and be happier.",

After a few hours he himself would wake up and start asking us who we are,  he loses his memory that time . But one thing I find odd is that he forgets our names and what are we related to him but he never forgets some specific things like to not watch mobile phone. One thing which made me question about his memory loss is that he always remembered his office laptops password even after losing his memory one more thing is that he also remembers a specific thing and that was to not play minecraft because it was addictive as he said before losing memory. After losing his memory yet he remembers that minecraft is addictive. \nThese memory losing episodes happen at least 6-7 times a year.

    "body": "Hey. I'm a teenager (16-18; not comfortable saying my actual age), M, in a pretty stressful situation. For years now, my mental health has been declining immensely. I was sexually abused for 2 years between the ages of 9 and 11, and while my abuser is behind bars now, the aftermath of what he did to me practically broke me. I've never been the same. I've developed a couple of disorders over the years such as BPD. My BPD has led me to spiral out and act in ways that I've hated myself for, but I also can't blame my behavior entirely on a disorder. I am not a good person. I'm a sociopath despite also having empathetic traits, I'm a compulsive liar, and something of a narcissist even while I hate my own guts. To make matters worse I'm a shut-in. I have 1 friend irl and we aren't very close. My previous few friendships have ended bitterly, and I rarely leave the house due to my fear of being perceived at all. The only friend I really have (that isn't online) is my mom. And she can never truly understand the depths of what I go through. My mental state has been declining rapidly for months, well, really it's been years, but it's really been noticeable within the last, I'd say nine months. I was in a relationship for about a year, with a girl who I'll call A, but a couple months ago we cut things short. We were fwb for about a week, but that's over now too, because I have continously let A down and shown her that I'm not a good person, unintentionally, but it still happened. She doesn't love me anymore and says she doesn't see herself ever loving me again. I know a lot of you will probably go \"just drop her, she's not that important,\" but that isn't the case for me. I really truly love her and I want to be a better person. I want to be okay again and I'm looking for advice in any form. Please. I'm desperate at this point.",

    "body": "I don't know what is wrong with me. I've been going to therapy for half year. Originally, it was to try to help me cope with my emotions and to regulate them, I'm not really able to have normal reactions to anything. It all seems to be amplified. The smallest thing can send me down a spiral to a point where I hurt myself or get me feeling euphoric, or both just within a few hours. The weird thing is, I would prefer to stay on that low, rather than to have my mind shift back and forth so quickly. It's exhausting to a point where I would rather not feel anything.\n\nAnyways, my therapy sessions quickly became about my relationships with alcohol, and I'll be the first to admit that it's problematic. I experience blackouts at least weekly and every time they cause extreme anxiety. I'm worried I might hurt someone someday. Still, I can't imagine going sober, it's the only thing that can make me feel at peace. I know my relationship with alcohol is problematic, but ever since my sessions became dominated by the topic, we've not had time to talk about anything else, hence why I'm turning to this place.\n\nA couple of months ago I started experiencing what I thought might be psychotic episodes. I told a friend about this and he told me not to jump to any conclusions and see how things developed. It's not been getting better. It's nothing extreme, but I will sometimes hear a ringing in my ear, a knock on the door or see something blocking my path when I'm out walking. The worst thing of all I experience, is that I can sometimes feel like someone is behind me. I can't relax, I feel like I am being watched, and I don't always know what is real. I just want to relax, I just want quite.\n\nIt is all to noisy, I just want it to be over",

Because the pink clouds pull you back like you were never here, the grey fox sends it's roam threw fields of memory and straight into your room and wraps it's gentle cold arms around you. The music that made your heart beat like a love interest makes it's voice again. And even if the time was bad or good or somewhere in between, you feel safe in the cradle of memory. I heard nostalgia is a lie that makes bad moments seem like they were good all a long. But maybe nostalgia is just a reminder that even when life felt disgusting, even when we felt like we were roting, there was always beauty waiting for us, to see it, to feel it, the way we do it to remember it.\n\n",

I disgust myself... my body, my face...\n\nand my personality? Well... I'm a shy introvert who doesn't know how to talk to people. I have to say that I have friends from my taekwondo classes, but I only hang out with them during class. At least they're the best friends I could wish for :,)\n\nI go to the gym 4 days a week (or sometimes 5) that's one of my pathetic attempts to raise my nonexistent self-esteem... I also go to taekwondo classes 3 times a week, I have a green belt :D and on the days when I don't have gym or taekwondo I usually go for walks on a treadmill I have at home, exercise has helped me silence my brain that screams at me that I'm fat and that... basically makes me feel less guilty...\n\nand well, apart from the gym and taekwondo I never, EVER leave my house, I stay up all day playing Fallout on my PC, I don't even have online friends, and since I don't have school yet (my parents are looking for a school for me)...\n\nin short: I hate my life, I hate my physical appearance, my body, my face, my personality, I don't know what to do to change, I've tried using acne creams, I've gone to the gym, I spend a lot of time combing my hair before going out, I watch videos on how to get a \"glow up\" But... nothing makes me feel good... and I don't know what to do to change myself... I'm a loser in every sense of the word...\n\nI see couples my age, happy, loving, and... I feel sad, because deep down I know I'll never achieve that, I know I'll never have a girl, I'm a mess, what woman would even want to look at me?\n\nI have dreams, I want to be a soldier, but seeing my current situation that's a dream very, very far from me... oh!\n\nAnd I also have an addiction to... \"self-pleasuring\" and adult videos... no one knows, until now... anyway...

Not to sound egotistical, but I’m arguably the best player on our hs team.\n\nAnyway, today we had a game just like any other. It was non conference (so it mattered less than other games) and I wasn’t doing so hot today. If you know anything about baseball, you know umpires suck. And today it seemed like they had it out for me. I kept getting horrible calls and shit just wasn’t going my way. I ended up striking out 3 time today, which I rarely strike out at all. Not trying to blame the umpires, but they screwed me out of so many pitches. In my last at bat, I had bases loaded and one out and we were down by one. I struck out on a bullshit pitch the catcher caught in the dirt and I was livid. I’ve never been good with my emotions, so that umpire heard about every swear word I knew as I walked back to the dugout fuming. I made my way down the steps to our locker room after slamming my helmet against my leg and throwing my bat (made sure no one got hit because I didn’t want to hurt someone else mid crash out) and I was so angry at myself for letting the team down, angry because my dad would be upset at me for failing in a crucial situation, and angry because it was my 3rd strikeout on the day.\n\nLong story short I ended up punching a wall as hard as i possibly could and ended up with a bad boxers fracture (yes I know fucking stupid decision. I have mental problems and I can’t control my anger sometimes.) I played the rest of the game but it was bruised and hurt like hell.\n\nSo now, I’m out for at least 6 weeks if not worse depending what the ortho specialist tells me (I can’t get in until this next Monday). Basically I fucked myself, fucked my team, and I feel like complete shit for many more reasons.\n\nI don’t know why I’m posting this, I just wanted to vent somewhere. Also, my dad is one of those dads you can’t talk to about shit so that doesn’t help any. \n\nI just feel like shit because I just ruined my senior year of high school and could’ve even fucked up my college baseball as well. \n\nI want to go die in a hole.",

    "body": "For the past 5 or so years I have been horribly depressed. I've dealt with the works. Most everything except suicidal thoughts and self harm, thankfully. I'm losing friends because I can't bring myself to talk to them. I'm not enjoying things I used to enjoy. I'm somehow more socially inept than I was before, and I am more isolated than I ever was before. I'm gaining weight. I've been fat most my life but it's worse now than it ever was. I'm falling apart physically because of it. I am so depressed that I can barely get out of my bed to go to work, let alone take care of my hygiene.\n\nIdeally, I'd talk to a therapist about this, but here's where my main problem starts. I can't do it. I don't know why I can't, I just can't. Every day I think \"today's the day I'll call and set up an appointment.\" but I never do it. Every day I plan to make various calls. Today's the day I'll call a doctor and see what I can do about my failing health. Today's the day I'll call and get the oil changed in my car. It's needed the oil changed for several months. \n\nEvery day I plan to take care of myself. Today's the day I go for a run. Today's the day I take a shower, lord knows I need one. Today's the day I talk to my friends again. Today I'm gonna go to the gym. Today I'm gonna yadda yadda yadda. I make these promises knowing I won't follow through on them.\n\nIt's like there's a wall physically preventing me from doing things that would help. Some of it's my horrible memory. Some of it's my horrible issues with procrastination, but surely that can't explain everything. Surely, after 5 months, I'd just call a place and have them change the oil in my car. Why haven't I?\n\nI haven't got a clue. My issues are entirely self inflicted and I can't do anything about it. I say I'll do something about it, but I won't. Who could live like this? I'm just sitting here in my room or at work festering. This ain't no way to live. Maybe it is self harm, just a different way? I feel like anyone else in my position would just be able to make those phone calls and follow through on their plans. What makes me so pathetic that I can't even make a phone call that would literally only make my life better?\n\n  \nTLDR: I have so many issues that could be resolved if I just helped myself, but for some unknown reason I just can't.",

    "body": "Let me go straight to the point, in particular let me explain the \"occasionally\" in the title.\n\nIn general, I(23M) feel \"good\" in my everyday life. I say \"good\" in quotation marks because it's not like I'm truly happy, but I'm okay. The problem arises when I meet a girl and start developing feelings for her. It's like I completely lose my mind.\n\nQuick side note: things have never really worked out for me with a girl. For one reason or another, I’ve never had a real relationship, even though I've met quite a few girls. Just \"situationships.\"\n\nThat being said, every time things don’t work out (which is always), the period afterward is devastating. I feel extremely lonely, behind compared to my peers, and the thought of seeing that girl with someone else kills me—even though, in reality, nothing serious ever happened between us. This feeling lasts for weeks or even months, depending on whether she disappears from my life or if she’s part of a shared friend group, meaning I have to keep seeing her now and then.\n\nAll these emotions completely vanish once I get over the \"crash.\"\n\nThe point is, I don’t want this to keep happening. I want to be okay with myself, period. I’m not saying I want to be completely indifferent in situations like this, but I just don’t want to feel this overwhelming sadness for months. Also, I can’t afford it! During these rough periods, I can’t focus, I can’t study, I lose my appetite...\n\nAnd yet, I feel like it doesn’t make sense that I’m not okay with myself. I manage to achieve almost all the goals I set for myself (university, working out, personal challenges...), and overall, I’d say my life is going pretty well. I just can’t seem to be happy—I really think I don’t know how to be okay on my own. And every time I get close to the possibility of a relationship, everything falls apart.\n\nWhat could I do?",

There have been moments where glimpses of his old self come through, but they usually don’t last long before he falls back into old patterns.\n\nHe’s been open with our family about not feeling mentally well, which I appreciate. His life now seems to revolve almost entirely around his computer — he works at the PC, then plays games for hours, and smokes weed regularly. It feels like he’s stuck in a loop. Conversations with him are hard; after just a couple of minutes, the tone usually shifts to negativity about life, work, or people in general. He often seems angry or bitter, and it’s hard to talk to him without feeling like you're walking on eggshells.\n\nWhat’s also difficult is that our conversations are completely one-sided. He rarely, if ever, asks how I’m doing or shows interest in anyone else. When I do ask him something, it can feel like a burden for him to answer. I’ve offered my support many times — whether that’s talking, helping him get into training, or improving his daily routines — but he always declines.\n\nThe hard part for me now is that I’ve started to feel incredibly frustrated.

His pessimism and self-centered outlook are really draining my energy, and sometimes I even find myself getting angry with him — even though I know he’s not well.\n\nSo my question is: how can I, as a relative, actually support him without burning myself out in the process? What can I do that could make a difference — if anything — and when is it okay to step back?\n\nWe had a family dinner today and I am so exhausted, it's like he drained all my energy.",

I’m not going to get into details, but I felt as if my emotions were either at 0 or 100, but now I feel as though they’re just at 0 constantly.

Throughout our relationship, there have been numerous occasions where I have felt uncomfortable. He was in a car with a girl all by themselves, re-added and snapped his ex, lusted over other girls. And yes I mentioned how I was uncomfortable but not much of a change at the time. To add, he complained my entire prom. Also, I cannot help but keep remembering this one instance where I didn't want to do something sexual but he kept going through with it until I said \"fine\" or something last min and then continued to cry and ask for it to stop. He is so good to me now and INCREDIBLY close with family and family friends. I feel lost and conflicted and honestly just here because i have no idea what to think or feel.",

I’ve been getting suicidal again, a feeling I haven’t felt in a really long time aside from in moments of high stress or during episodes.\n\nI’m not actively suicidal or anything, but I have just been feeling like a fraud and that I just simply don’t see a reason to live aside from for my mom. I don’t want to live. Maybe it’s out of laziness to actually try in life, maybe it’s because of the things that have happened to me or the things I’ve done. Maybe I just feel like I should have some right to not live. I mean, I didn’t ask to be here, why should I be forced to stay? I dunno.\n\nAnd then my OCD has been getting really bad again. I can barely function without randomly getting set off and my hands have started to get really dry again. Not to the point of bleeding, but still, they burn sometimes. I get caught in guilt cycles, sometimes reasonable and sometimes not. \n\nI’ve started to have episodes again or random moments where I will become overwhelmingly upset and start having a breakdown only to have it disappear as quickly as it came. I can barely look at myself in the mirror because the person there isn’t me. I can’t stand the way I look and the way I was born and nobody seems to understand what I mean. “Oh you don’t look like xyz” or something along those lines seems to be expected to fix my problem.\n\nAnd yet how am I supposed to believe that when everyone who is not close to me says the exact opposite? I dunno. I know they’re trying yo help but it just doesn’t.\n\nI’m struggling to be able to do much and I just don’t feel well. I may not be slicing my thighs or being hospitalized, but I feel horrible. I feel just as bad and I feel like that’s worse, especially since I have nothing to show.\n\nAnd how am I supposed to be believed when I’m seemingly doing so well?

I was recently diagnosed with hypersensitivity, anxiety, school phobia and depression. I'm seeing a shrink and I've already seen a psychiatrist. Despite everything, my suicidal thoughts are becoming more and more frequent. I'm starting to hear voices, whispers and fear of being alone with them (voices + whispers). I suspect more than what I've been diagnosed with but I'm not qualified on the subject. I cut myself regularly, the last time was hundreds of cuts on my thighs, I also cut myself inside my mouth, split my lips, overdosed on medication, slapped, hit on the face, stomach, chest or even legs. I'm looking for an escape from all this but the only way out would be death. I've also already drawn disturbing things, seen things like autopsies, cut bodies and all that category. These images are engraved in my memory and give me behaviors of post-traumatic stress that are always present. I have the impression of being constantly observed, followed, and judged constantly. I no longer go to school, on the verge of dropping out. Also, I have already tried to kill myself by overdosing too much, by crashing, by being run over, or by drowning in my bathtub. The shrink, for her part, often emphasizes the fact that I am obsessed with the things that happen in my head, and that I have many depressive tendencies underlining my diagnosis. So I am looking for help. I am open to any questions to move the matter forward. But I beg you if you have read my message, do not leave, do not leave me, I am terribly alone and I need help, an explanation about what is wrong with me...",

I can “power through it” around others, but the moment I’m in the car, or home it hits me all at once. And that’s when my mother wants to talk. Just normal stuff, but I am so tired I can’t even think straight, yet alone talk. She gets irritated because I don’t answer “correctly” (the tone), and when I try to again tell her I’m mentally tired, not physically, and that it takes a lot to speak or do other stuff she disagrees.

What if I kill my mother? If after the thoughts of hurting me I was already bad, imagine after that went through my head... literally that I couldn't even see my mother she was terrible, if before I was anxious because after thinking that I had twice as much... investigating through Google I found content about intrusive thoughts and such, at that moment reading about the subject I found a phrase that helped me at that moment (you are not your thoughts) to literally eliminate the physical symptoms I had even though those thoughts were still there. A few days after this I went to the psychiatrist to tell him exactly what I'm telling in this message and he told me about impulse phobias, I went home and a few days after this in the news of Antena 3 the typical ones that give at night well, they talked about a news of a boy with schizophrenia and well what happened to me is that I was literally shocked, I barely slept that night, literally hearing that it was like, I have this. I started looking for symptoms throughout the summer and a few more months, in total 4/5 followed day by day by Google, by YouTube videos of people with schizophrenia, videos about psychotic outbreaks, well from there I'm bad no, the following. I literally began to be aware of the sounds and what I saw and if I saw something out of the corner of my eye I scratched myself in case I was hallucinating or for example I was watching a video on YouTube of whatever and if I heard something that could be out of that video, I went back the video to see if I heard it again, that was an example of what I was doing, I was aware of what I saw or if I saw things out of the ordinary, I also read about delusions and paranoia and to give an example, read that these people think that They want to kill them and that from there I have thoughts of that style, although I know that they are a lie, in Spanish I've barely found information as if I've found it in English and they relate it to OCD, but literally sometimes I doubt that this can be OCD, this seems like something serious I'm afraid it's psychosis or schizophrenia I'm shit I need help, it seems that I'm delirious sometimes even though I know that certain thoughts are not logical... I think that reading symptoms has fucked my head because in my life I have had these thoughts.\n",

It feels like I’m playing pingpong with my emotions, changing my opinion on my habbits daily allmost. \nI don’t want others to worry or feel bad for me so now after being caught once already by a parent I have gone to less noticble places. \nMaybe It’s some subconscious guilt that I can’t process at the moment, or I just don’t want to get into trubble.\nIt’s not that I cut deep really or at any vital point. \nI just want to feel the sting. \nIt bothers me mentally when I’m in public atleast this time since I did it on my shoulder (nobody sees but me and my friends tend to see allot of yellow cars haha).\n\nAnyways, sometimes I hurt myseld by emotional outbursts after bottling up, but more often I don’t have emotional outbursts while doing it, so maybe its boredom?\n\nOkay so real question is, can it all just be an addiction? If this counts as an addiction that is. \nThen again, if I wanted to stop already I would. While I don’t wanna stop I’m afraid tyat I might find someone who loves me in the future who gets scared off by my scars even if they’re not too bad. Currently my shoulder looks like its been attacked by a squirel, theres no way to exuse the wounds either unless I wanna blame my “ghost cats”. \n\nAnyways this whole thing might be too confusing to even awnser too, so I’m sorry about that,,,\n\nAlso incase someone asks, yeah I have suecidal thoughts, but I’m not going anywhere, I’m too busy \n\n",

    "body": "Disclaimer: This is going to be a long post.\n\nI want to start by giving some background on my mom (72) and her relationships.\n\nMy mom has always had a strong personality—loving, generous, and always putting others before herself. But she is also extremely authoritative, likes to control every situation, and is highly sensitive. If something upsets her, no matter how small, she will cut you off for weeks or even months. Apologizing is not in her vocabulary.\n\nMy dad (80) has been the biggest victim of this dynamic. He is extremely servile, has a hearing problem, and sometimes just zones out—probably to avoid unnecessary arguments. But even in the smallest things, she asserts control. The television remote, for example, belongs solely to her. If my dad tries to raise the volume so he can hear, her mood will turn sour instantly.\n\nShe has always been strict and believes in correcting “others,” regardless of their age. She started her career as a disciplinarian at just 16 and was running a school at a very young age. People respected her—not just out of obligation, but because they truly admired her.\n\nLately, her ability to handle disagreements has become unbearable. You cannot win an argument with her. She lacks the ability to resolve conflicts through communication, and it’s exhausting.\n\nI noticed a real shift in her personality after my grandmother passed away 12 years ago. My mom stayed by her side in the hospital for four straight years. Then, seven years ago, she lost her younger sister to lung cancer—a sudden battle that lasted only two months. That loss broke her. Since then, she has never been the same. She doesn’t enjoy anything anymore. She eats just to stay alive.\n\nTwo months ago, she suffered a bad fall and bruised her face badly. Since then, her mood has been extremely low. She refuses to get a head scan because she no longer trusts doctors after everything she saw while caring for her mother.\n\nThe past two months have made me see her differently. For most of my life, I’ve seen her as this tough, unshakable force. But now, I can’t help but feel that her rigid personality is a shield—a defense mechanism to cope with deep trauma. And now, that shield is cracking.\n\nI don’t know how to help her, but I want to try. If anyone has experience with something like this, I’d appreciate your advice.",

From AI-powered therapy apps to VR-based exposure therapy, we are seeing innovations that were unimaginable a decade ago.\n\nSome emerging technologies that could revolutionize mental health in the next 5-10 years include:\n\n* **AI-driven mental health support:** AI chatbots and virtual therapists are improving, offering 24/7 support and personalized guidance. Could they complement or even replace traditional therapy in some cases?\n* **Neurotechnology & brain-computer interfaces:** With companies like Neuralink working on direct brain-computer interactions, could we see real-time mood regulation or AI-assisted cognitive therapy?\n* **VR & AR therapy:** Virtual reality is already being used to treat PTSD and anxiety through exposure therapy. How far can this go in making therapy more immersive and effective?\n* **Wearable mental health tracking:** Smartwatches and biometric sensors are evolving to track stress, mood, and even detect early signs of depression. Could this lead to proactive mental health interventions?\n* **Psychedelic-assisted therapy:** While not purely a tech innovation, AI and data-driven analysis could help optimize psychedelic treatments for mental health conditions like PTSD and depression.\n\nWhat do you think?

Basically, it feels like my therapist just listens to me psychoanalyze myself.\n\nAlso, since I mostly talk about what happened over the past week, I feel like I am ultimately responding to symptoms rather than the root causes (I.e., unhealthy attitudes, character flaws, and mental conditions driving these behaviors). But of course I'm not the mental health professional. I'm not the one who's supposed to know *why* I have these problems. I expect my therapist to tell me what's wrong with me, but he mostly just listens to me talk during our sessions. And I'm not satisfied with the results I'm getting.\n\nIs there something I'm doing wrong? Is there something he's doing wrong? What should I expect from a therapist, and how can I get more out of this?",

    "body": "I'm gonna try to word this carefully but please forgive me if my thinking is misinformed. I also want to preface this by saying I love my partner immensely and I just want her safe and healthy and able to live a somewhat normal life. \n\nMy partner of 3 years struggles with BPD and has experienced a lot of trauma in her life. Over the past several months she's attempted suicide several times and she's been self harming. Each of these attempts resulted in her voluntarily admitting herself to a mental health facility but each time after a short while (2 weeks at most) she would check herself out, be doing ok for about a month, and then another attempt and another stint in a facility. Yesterday there was another attempt and she's currently staying with her dad because she wasn't admitted this time.\n\nI want a future with her, I want to have kids and a home and a real future but with this pattern it's not possible to have that. I'm considering establishing an ultimatum that she goes through a program at a mental health facility in full or I leave. I can't keep doing this, I can't keep seeing the love of my life destroy herself, and I can't have the future I want with her if she doesn't get the help she needs. \n\nPlease, if you have a perspective on this that would be valuable or if you think I'm going about this the wrong way, voice that. This isn't something I'm accustomed to and the idea of an ultimatum seems unfair for me to impose but I don't know what else to do at this point and this is a last resort. ",

    "body": "This is my first time posting on reddit but I need help because I’m unable to reach a psychologist or any mental health professional because of financial issues and parents not believing bad mental health is an issue.\n\nI’m 16F. I’ve had issues of mood for the past two years where I’d get highs of genuine happiness I’d be unable to sit still with high energy and would become extremely extroverted as well impulsively spend all my money although these highs only last a day or two. I’d get what I’d called depressive episodes where I feel so paralysed with sadness? I become very withdrawn from others and im unable to do any of my schooling or even the basics of taking care of myself. these episodes can last weeks or even to a month which was my longest. \n\nI feel emotions very severely too whenever I’m happy or sad I can feel it extremely. I’ve always been ‘sensitive’ sometimes such minor situations can make me feel so strongly in response which I can’t help and it’s tiring to always feel things so intensively when I know it’s so minor. Ive always had a heavy distaste to schedules and planning only able to do things in the spur of the moment, as well Im heavily impulsive like I mentioned money wise and with my entire life. I’d make drastic changes to my life/myself just for the hell of it which would entail SH or life changes like changing schools just because I felt like it even though my life was perfectly balanced \n\n\nI always had issues with therapy as well every-time I get in I’d go in for a few sessions then eventually I’d think I’m magically cured and I wouldn’t need it anymore, many times I go through a phase of thinking I made it all up and I was just trying to be different. Only to crash into another depressive episode a week later and unable to function again. Hence it makes it hard to do therapy, no one is willing to stay around when I get into these switches.\n\nI’m only posting now because I’m struggling a lot with my emotions especially when I deal with love in my life it ties mostly into my strong feelings. I become very possessive and jealous it’s hard to control how I feel as well I constantly drift inbetween hating and loving the person I like?? Which is confusing I’m never able to be certain on someone I’m always drifting between strong emotions.\n\nI’ve felt normal for some time not exactly overly sad or overly happy which I feel balanced but dealing with some overthinking. I’ve found the only forced relief like medication, antidepressants helps but I find myself completely numb with no emotions which is relieving to not feel so much but I feel too empty unable to feel anything. As well smoking weed brings me a relief on my emotions and helps me relax.\n\nThe only other opinion I’ve gotten by a close friend is that they notice I had a tendency to quickly switch up quite a lot and they feel like I’m bipolar.\n\nI’m asking for an idea of what could align with this behaviour? I don’t want to self diagnose but I’m unable to get any mental health help. I’d like to be able to get some opinions. Very helpful if someone has any advice on how to handle behaviour like this? I want to improve but it feels very hard sometimes.\n(Sorry if my writing is chopped it’s late💔)",

    "body": "I honestly don't really feel like typing this cause I don't give a fuck. I'm just doing this because I feel obligated to \"try\".Well, not just, but that's the major reason.\n\nFirst question, should I change therapists? \n\nI have an art therapist, who has shown me compassion, and has tried for me, when no-one else has, or could.\n\n I'm in a dysfunctional and I guess..., neglectful household? We're all kinda fucked so no-one can give real compassion or empathy. I used to even abuse people so they would feel what I felt so they would know I was upset, but then I'd feel bad. I now realise I was trying to artificially create some kind of empathy.\n\nI'm 15 now, turning 16 soon, yaaaay... anyways, Ive bonded with my therapist, she really, truely cares for me, I guess even more than me or my mother. This has led me to has an emotional attachment, but the thing is, I don't think having someone who cares is enough. I need real extensive care, but I also can't throw her away.\n\nI can feel myself shutting down, I can feel my Brain shutting down. I've lost urgency, passion, and more. I already know that those are privileged feelings, so I shouldn't be that shocked, but the thing is, through everything, those feelings were my wavering flame of hope. \n\nMaybe this is me healing. Maybe because I'm not in survival mode and I'm healing, my main system shut down and is only allowing my other systems to come on one at a time. \n\nBut I don't have time to waste, I dont have a person to find day to day comfort in and support,  someone to hold my hand while I learn to walk like a baby again. \n\nI can't afford this. I transferred to another form of education but it's been months and I haven't touched my computer.\n\nThe government's getting pissed, and I'm being pushed by everyone and everything. I'm but a head floating above the rapidly rising water in a closed tank with a sealed on lid.\n\nI tell people I want to get better, I tell them I need a break and thier only response is \"how can we get you back on track\". \n\nBack on track?\n\nI can't feel passion or hope or urgency, but I suffer knowing it's there and unreachable. \n\nI don't want to burn myself out, to the point that when I get space to rest, my little flame hides and leaves me in the dark. It's still in me, wavering and scared and passionate, and bright and I can't find it.\n\nI've lost a part of myself, and all they want is results.\n\nWhat can I do?\n\nI couldn't even write a schedule or re-order the to do notes Ive been writing down for over a year and never completing.\n\nI have spilled my body in the form of tears with the smell of blood, in front of others for half ass responses.\n\nThey say all I need is for someone to point me in the right direction, and that could've worked, at one point.\nBut now searching stuff up is too hard, caring is too hard, being vulnerable, is too hard.\n\nI want to be happy. But the push and the shove, push and shove.\n\nI got off topic.\n\nNext question, how do I stay lazy?\n\nHow can I avoid life? Im only a teenage, if there's one point in life I should be able to rest without worrying about bills and jobs, should it not be now? \n\nDo I have to be admitted into a mental hospital? \n\nAm I going through enough to be admitted? \n\nAre they going to treat me bad?\n\nWhat do I do.\n  \n",

    "body": "This has been weighing on me, and I need some outside opinions.\n\nFor context, I'm turning 20 soon. When I was 16, 1 became best friends with a girl named Stacey. We were close up until the spring of my junior year (I was 17). Around that time, I was in a toxic situationship with an older drug dealer named jack. It wasn't even a real relationship, but I was trauma-bonded to him.\n\nDuring spring break, Stacey confessed that she had slept with jack and profusely apologized. At first, I accepted her apology, but after a week, I couldn't even bear looking at her. Eventually, I cut her off completely. My three best friends supported me through the whole thing and also stopped being friends with her out of loyalty to me.\n\nFast forward to now: Stacey reached out to me last fall with a long, heartfelt apology. After thinking about it for a while, I decided to forgive her. Since then, we've been in nonstop contact-texting, calling, and rebuilding our friendship.\n\nShe's actually moving back to Florida (where I live) this Monday, and we'll probably start hanging out again.\nThe problem? I haven't told my three best frie yet. I know they're going to have strong opinion because they cut Stacey off for me back then.\n\nOne of them knows Stacey apologized but\nassumes we only follow each other now. Another knows she reached out but bashed her immediately, so I never told him we stayed in contact. The third has no idea about any of it.\n\nI feel nervous, even though I know I'm allowed to make my own choices. I chose to forgive her because l've grown, I believe people change, and I don't want to hold onto anger over something that happened when we were teenagers. I'm also a Christian, and I believe in second chances. My parents and boyfriend support my decision, but I feel like I owe my friends an explanation because of how much they supported me in the past.\n\nI considered just posting a photo of Staceyand me without saying anything, but I worry that would blindside them. On the other hand, I don't want to send a dramatic message and make it seem like I'm asking for their approval.\n\nSo, Reddit-how do I approach this? Should I tell them individually, send a short group message or just post and let them react? Any advice isappreciated.",

    "body": "I woke up this morning full of joy, and enthousiasme, because, i was able to go to school, and see her! I had dressed myself nicely, it was a girl i always talked to, whenever, even when i was sick to the point of dropping on the ground. She was a Friend of mine, \"we\" used to talk a lot at school, but it seem like she didn't wanna talk to me that much after i confessed. She was always so happy around my friends, not even bothering to talk to me, apart for important things. I always took care of her, she was always sick, so i gived her food when i had it, when she sat alone, because she didn't pay for the cafetaria and all her friends where there, i always asked my friends if i could go join her not to let her alone. I always did my best, texting her everyday, if i did not she wouldn't even text back. At one point, i understood, that i was only clowning myself, so, i just abandonned, and she didn't even care, maybe i'm not such a great person, was i too selfish? Was not enough? Even though she knew. She seemed more interested by my friend, and he didn't even like her. But i did, and i always do. I guess i'm probably just a clown in her life, in my life aswell, i wish i just didn't fall in love, because, i'm just destroying myself. Or was i already destroyed inside? I truly hate myself, i always had this thought that maybe am not cut for this, i would have abandonned sooner, but this damn habit of mine, wanting to not abandon, i probably should not have risen up back when i was kid, i should have learned to abandon. When i texted her, today, saying that, she really didn't seem to care about our conversation online, she was dry, and didn't even seem to want to respond, i just sayed that it's okay, i don't hate her, i hate myself, because i know im probably not interesting, boring, ugly, i can't even define myself. I probably just want to die, listen to this voice in the back of my head. But what will it change, dead or alive, i'm still a clown. I had everything, a good life, parents, friends, family, i'm sprotif (volleyball), i learn piano, i write novels, i read. But it seems like it will never be enough, but i can't forget her, because she was my everything. We weren't in couple, yet i was jealous, but what could i do? Just continue hating myself for bot being enough for someone? I wish i wasn't born, if it was to never be loved, and only the person to love, what was my purpose? That's one of my stupid questions. But i must continue, because i know damn right my parents fought to give me a future, they didn't have the childhood i had, yet they gave it to me. Yet, yes, yet, i always wonder if i should be around, i always wonder if im loved, if my presence brighten someone day. I always wonder if i matter. Because i know damn right the world will continue to turn even if i'm gone right? Then maybe i'm not needed, i always wonder if i should just disappear.",

    "body": "Hi everyone,  \n  \nI'm 24 years old, living in Germany, and I’ve been struggling with severe depression and generalized anxiety  disorder (diagnosed) for a long time. I have no contact with my family and live alone. Even though I meet up with friends regularly—for example, going on nature walks—I often still feel incredibly lonely. Communication is hard for me, and my mind constantly feels foggy, making it difficult to think, speak, or even write clearly.\n\nPhysically, I experience symptoms like heart palpitations, dizziness while walking, tinnitus, muscle pain, tension, and twitching. My sleep is completely irregular, and I often feel extreme exhaustion. Some days, I don’t eat properly and just scroll on my phone for hours, like when i wake up i'm on IG and scrolling for almost 1-2 hours before i actually wake up. I struggle with keeping up with daily tasks, and appointments stress me out so much that I often avoid them.\n\nI started outpatient therapy, but I was told that it likely wouldn’t be effective for me. Since then, I’ve barely seen a doctor because I’m terrified of being diagnosed with something serious. I’ve always had a strong tendency toward hypochondria, and I constantly worry about my health. At the same time, I also experience existential fears—financial struggles, feeling stuck in life, and an overwhelming fear of the future. Some days, I think about death as a relief, even though I don’t actually want to die, i'm actually scared to die.\n\nAfter my last real relationship ended (2years ago), my mental health declined a lot. I started smoking heavily (14-15 cigarettes a day, sometimes even more) and drinking regularly on weekends with friends and going to parties. I don't do that anymore regularly, instead we meet for hiking, but I still feel like I’m just stuck in a cycle—spending five days at home doing nothing but being on the PC sometimes playing the piano and gaming with friends, feeling overwhelmed by even the smallest tasks, and being afraid to go outside alone.\n\nI know I need to change something, but I feel like my body is made of lead, and everything is just too overwhelming. I often have disturbing dreams, feel emotionally unstable, and struggle with feelings of anger, frustration, and worthlessness. I worry a lot about what others think of me and fear that people notice how bad I actually feel.\n\nI guess I just need to hear from someone who understands. Are there others here who feel the same way? Or has anyone been in a similar situation and found a way to cope? I don’t need criticism—I already know I’m struggling. I just want to feel less alone in this.\n\nThank you for reading.",

    "body": "(Using a throwaway as my friends+mom know and follow my main account.)   \nI've never had it diagnosed but I know I have *some* kind of anxiety problem. I have been absolutely TERRIFIED of losing my teeth/having them rot out for as long as I can remember. I distinctly remember losing my first baby tooth and I had what I can only describe as an anxiety attack and not telling my parents because I was so scared. I'm 16 now and I've only been to the dentist once in my life, at 7. Another problem is that, and I'm not sure why, but my parents had never really done very much to make sure me or my siblings really took care of our dental health, which I think has made it just become worse with time. So there was no 'brush your teeth before bed, brush your teeth in the morning' sort of thing, or going to the dentist, and I'm imagining most parents *make* their kids do it. And that's not really to say that this is entirely their fault because I love my parents so much and I honestly do think most of this is probably my fault. Only saying that it let me get away with never brushing my teeth as a kid, even if I knew I should have been. I didn't brush my teeth because I was too scared to do it (I started doing it every day right after I turned 13 though, so that was pretty big for me).   \n  \nSo it eventually became all I thought about every day. My parents knew about this since I was pretty young, I've told them on several occasions about just how truly bad it is, and I don't know why but it just never came up to do anything about the underlying mental issue. My teeth have never looked great. They're not rotted black or anything quite as extreme as that but they don't look nice and I keep getting afraid that they will eventually get to that point. I can't laugh or smile without thinking about how awful I must look. Last year I spent my entire summer rotting in my room from the anxiety because I *thought* I saw something black on a molar (It doesn't look like that anymore, I believe it was in my head or something to that effect). It took months of building up courage but I finally told my mom that I wanted to go to the dentist again, she said she'd look into it, and it's been 8 months, she hasn't done anything. In the last month or so the anxiety has gotten worse and I feel a little resentful that she hadn't done anything when I asked, because I keep telling her I have a problem and I keep getting anxiety attacks.   \n  \nI don't want to resent her, I love her, but sometimes I can't help feeling the urge to blame her for everything. She's a forgetful person and I know I should ask again but it took me two and a half months to even find the courage to talk about it the first time and I still get so anxious just thinking about it that I just have so much doubt that I'll even do it at this point. I don't even know how I'd get through a dentist visit, I feel like I'd actually have to be put unconscious or something. I feel like I should have done things different and then none of this would be happening. I almost feel like it's ruined my life because I don't know if there's ever been a single day that has gone by where I don't think about this and just feel hopeless. It gets hard to keep telling them I need help and they do nothing. All this to say that I'd appreciate any kind of encouragement or whatever positivity/advice anybody has to throw my way because I don't really have friends to talk to about this and I really need it right now.

And he (the baby) lives next door and is extremely close to us.

I don't like the way she holds him, because it seems like she always does everything to touch his private parts.

It's hard to believe that she, no matter how bad she is, would do something like that. \nMaybe it's without realizing it, maybe she's not being malicious, but the fact is that being so aware of this is bothering me.

When Covid hit, I gained a lot of weight and became anxious all the time. This affected my self esteem a lot. I felt embarrassed and ashamed of both my anxiety and weight gain, bc they were clear indicators I had given up. I leaned too much on my fiancé during this time, but I managed to lose the weight and start lexapro, which helped my anxiety so much. However, a month into starting lexapro I lost my mother to cancer. Her death was traumatic and awful. Seeing her that sick for 8 months changed me, and watching her die changed me even more. I always pretended i was fine, but the truth is I never found the old me. I gained the weight back, I stopped caring about myself. I started finding anyway possible to distract myself, but what I didn’t realize at the time is that it pushed me further away from my fiancé. I stopped trying and the relationship grew boring. She was by my side the whole time through everything, and that’s how I thanked her. By becoming distant and losing my spark and what made me, me. Losing the love of my life really opened my eyes. I’ve barely eaten in a week, and I don’t ever want to get out of bed. My whole world is shattered. This time, I can’t let it permanently break me even more. I have to get up and fight. I have to love myself again. I have to heal. I’ve beeen through a lot, but I will pick myself back up, and this time, I have to do it alone. I need to rediscover the old me, the me before the trauma of the last few years. I’m going to start with exercise, eating healthy, and making new friends. I have to put myself out there and be happy again. Before the last few years, I was always social and loved life. I turned into someone who is just surviving. I know I’m just venting, but if anyone here has any recommendations for me on where to start, or even any books I can read to help change my thought process and get in touch with my happiness again, please share them. I am finally ready to heal. ",

    "body": "I live with two roommates and it's nearly impossible to speak to them in any way when I'm depressed. It makes me feel so guilty. I can barely prepare myself food. I shower once a week because that's all I can do. Pretending to want to be alive in any way and pretending like I enjoy one second of my life is extremely exhausting ...it's downright embarassing. Like I do not want to be here. And I am sure my roommates can see it. I am not actively suicidal or anything. Even though my mom died by suicide when I was 18. (I am 34 now.) I just don't want to exist and pretending like I want to exist is torture. Faking a smile or pretending to laugh for my roommates is so hard. I am sick of hearing them laugh all day. What is so funny? Nothing is that funny. This life is so stupid and pointless. I am 34 years old, I'm poor, I have failed miserably in life, I am so sick of being forced to exist, I'm so profoundly unhappy and I am just done trying and I have to go back to work in April after having the winter off and I just can't do life anymore...it's getting worse as I get older. I just lay in bed all day watching TV and the only thing that gives me hope is that someday I won't exist anymore. There is less and less of me everyday. I have no personality anymore. I don't find anything interesting or funny or stimulating. I have nothing to say to my roommates. I don't feel human anymore. ",

    "body": "These conditions are always framed as disorders, but what if they’re actually superpowers?\n\nBipolar Disorder gives you intensity, vision, and bursts of creativity that can be absolutely genius. The highs feel like unlocking a level of thinking most people never reach. Yeah, the lows are brutal, but that kind of depth lets you see and feel things in ways others can’t. A lot of revolutionary thinkers, artists, and leaders had bipolar traits—because they saw things differently.\n\nAnxiety is basically a real-life spidey sense. Hyper-awareness, predicting every possible outcome, picking up on social cues before people even realize what they’re saying—society calls it overthinking, but in reality, it’s an evolved survival mechanism. Anxious people would thrive in high-stakes planning and strategy roles if the world actually valued that skill instead of dismissing it as “just relax.”\n\nADHD is like raw, untamed creative energy. It’s the ability to make connections others don’t see, jump between ideas, and innovate in ways neurotypicals would never think of. Impulsivity? More like taking the risks that lead to breakthroughs. Struggling with focus? Only when something isn’t interesting—when it is, good luck pulling an ADHD brain away from it.\n\nObviously, these things can be a struggle, but the real problem isn’t the traits themselves—it’s that society isn’t designed to work with them. Schools, jobs, social structures… all built for linear, structured thinking. But if these “disorders” were nurtured instead of suppressed, imagine what kind of innovation, art, and progress could come from it.\n\nSo yeah, maybe we’re not broken. Maybe we’re just superheroes trying to operate in a world that doesn’t understand our powers.\n\n",

    "body": "I’ve been reading a lot about “functional depression” and about how depressed people are not necessarily sad and I’m questioning if I might be depressed myself. I have a job that I enjoy in my family’s company, I have a boyfriend who lives in a different country and we see each other often and I really enjoy spending time with him. I love literature and I read a lot, staying informed, watching films and travelling. I have 5/6 friends that I see frequently.\n\nHowever I’m generally a “lazy” person. I love staying at home a lot, by myself. I see my friends at least once or twice a week but I prefer an early drink or a dinner, I absolutely refuse to go out late and party (I’m 27) even though I am and always been a night person. I never go to bed before 2am and when I can I wake up late. I feel like I stay in bed way more than the average person. When I work from home I sometimes stay in my bed. And my favourite part of the day is taking my make up off, showering, putting my pyjamas and just saying in bed reading, watching YouTube etc. I sometimes struggle to get out of the bed in the morning, when I don’t have a reason to leave the bed, like going to the office or some other engagement, my instinct is to just stay in bed and have a lazy morning scrolling on tik tok, watching a film or reading. Then around 11:30 I usually work out, shower and become more active, but I kinda always have to fight a little with my lazyness. In general if it’s not something that I really have to do like work or health stuff I often (not always) have to push myself a little to go out. Once I’m out having a drink with a friend or going to an exhibition I’m at ease and I like it, but I do also feel a sense of relief when I’m going back home, I’m hardly ever the one who pushes people to stay more or do something else. The only mental issue that I consciously have is anxiety. When I have something big coming at work I want to get it done and over it because I feel the pressure and the responsibility a lot, but it’s not overwhelming, I usually manage it and it pushes me to get the stuff done.\n\nI’m not the most energetic and smiley person in the world. I definitely have a negative outlook sometimes and I can get sad from time to time. But most of the time I like my life, I feel lucky.\n\nWhat do you think?",

Over the years, under my Drs supervision, I've played around with the times I take them - AM/PM - obviously, I am not talking about medications with time related specifications.\n\nI take Lithium, Lamictal, and Seroquel XR to address Bipolar and Vyvanse for ADHD. The dosage has been tweaked over the years as needed. Initially, I took the Lithium and Lamictal in the AM and the Seroquel XR in the PM which, for me, was obvious since its sedating effects were the only thing allowing me to sleep. Along with the obvious Vyvanse in the AM.\n\nIn the past few years I've made some adjustments: I started taking the Lithium in the PM with my Seroquel XR and keeping the Lamictal in the AM. My reasoning was two-fold: 1) the Lithium - while extremely effective - seemed to cause mild 'brain fog' and lethargy. 2) Due to the fact that Lithium is hard on the kidneys my Dr suggested taking it in the PM to lesson the strain put on them by also having to work through the digestion of the other stuff your consuming during the day. Which would also potentially address issue #1 - and it seemed to do so.\n\nIn the last year I also switched to taking the Lamictal in the PM - which, from what I've read and have heard from other people on it, is common and the 'typical' suggested time anyhow. For me, I think the main reason for transitioning to PM was pure practicality - take them all at one time.\n\nI have been EXTREMELY fortuante and, even though I've been on these meds for years, have experienced little to no negative side effects.\n\nWhat times do you take your meds? If you feel comfortable: what were some of the main reasons. Everyone is different and should do what works best for them so there is no room for judgement!",

It all just feels pointless.\n\nI take medication for my depression, but let’s be honest—no pills can fix a toxic environment. I want to move out so badly, but I have no money, no job, no plan. My mom constantly stresses me out, and my brother doesn’t really care—he’s the “golden child” who can do no wrong. I think I’m my dad’s favorite, but that just means he uses me as his emotional dumping ground, and I can’t handle that either.\n\nI’ve considered hospitalization, but what would that even change? My mom doesn’t believe in mental health issues, and my dad would just make it weird. My brother is younger than me, and I don’t want to burden him with this.\n\nI just don’t see a way out. I believe in God and try to remind myself that there’s a plan for me, but I don’t know what it is. I just want to be happy like everyone else. I don’t know why I have to suffer like this when I’ve done nothing to deserve it.\n\nI’ve been in therapy for two years, and my therapist is kind and understanding, but at the end of the day, she can’t change my home life. I don’t know what to do anymore.\n\nIf anyone has any advice or has been through something similar, please, I’d really appreciate hearing from you.",

She once got aggressive towards me when I was taking my laundry up because last time I forgot to take the hamper down. She doesn’t allow me to have any sense of individuality. She will get annoyed at me because I’m not wearing the right underwear or socks. She is also very overprotective, To the point where I am not allowed to go into our backyard when she is not her, I am not allowed to be out of sight when we’re outside, and I’m not allowed to leave the street without her watching. I rarely went outside for the first 12 yesrs of my life because she made it such a hassle. She also talks about how good of a parent she is extremely often. Once, I jokingly rooted against her football team and she made a comment about how she feeds me. When she apologizes, which is very rare, it is immediately followed by her talking about how stressed she is because of me. She is very smarmy and will act like I’m doing something wrong but refuse to say what I am doing wrong",

    "body": "I’m a 22 yr old female, This is my fourth semester handling 2 jobs and school as I support myself(College Junior). My past semesters were beyond hard but I had a partner who would help until we broke up at the end of last year. Diagnosed with persistent depressive disorder (I think I may be borderline) and anxiety. I’ve had very significant suicidal ideations for weeks but am too afraid. Last month i would constantly day dream about ending things. I was getting through my depression with music until I experienced hearing loss and tinnitus from noise overexposure and its made my life completely unbearable. I normally cope with my issues via music and smoking but neither is possible with my extreme tinnitus. It’s become nearly impossible to do my school work with my head noise. I’m beyond behind in school and have never cared less. \n\nI used pride myself on my hard work and intelligence but I can’t help but sob every morning I wake up. Trash and clothing from over a month has piled up to the point where I’m stepping over it and tripping in my bedroom and bathroom. I’m estranged from most of my family, already being extremely lonely and having the only two people in my life leave me on read when expressing my distress has made everything more severe. I feel terrible about myself now and feel like I want to rip out of my skin. I would do anything to have someone to call to help me eat or clean. The only strength I can muster is to show up my classes (FAFSA is the only reason I can afford school) and work as I’ve stopped working at my part time for near a month and have called out too many times at my full time that I risk getting in trouble. I already had to beg one teacher to extend a deadline that is worth 20% of my grade til Monday and I cannot get myself to do any of it. I haven’t genuinely laughed in weeks and have been constantly playing a character to not throw everybody off. I’ve been experiencing extreme agitation and mood swings for weeks now. Going days between showers and meals has become my norm. When I look in the mirror I cry from shame or don’t feel real at all. People around me think of me highly because of my hard work so now I feel like a complete failure. \n \nI’m hesitating to go to a hospital as I’m not sure what will happen to my schooling and the last thing I can do in this economy is owe FAFSA money. I feel like I might benefit psych ward as I am unable to care for myself. I am highly worried about being turned away for not being suicidal enough/ not being considered in crisis. A lot of people on here speak about how awful wards can be but I’m not sure I can take another day of living in so much emotional pain that my chest and muscles ache. I am concerned with my ear issues that being at the ward will destroy my ears. I spent every break at work crying today. I’m so burnt out but I have to pay my bills and it feels like the only purpose or goal I have in life is to receive an education. The ringing in my head everyday is painful. Any advice is deeply appreciated. ",

I know there can be many symptoms for it but I feel like I don't fall into any of them and I would tell people whether it's my doctor or my grandmother (she has had terrible anxiety for her whole life and she is an amazing person to talk to) and they would just say well it probably is anxiety. Because of this, I never know how to help myself when I go into bad episodes. Funf act actually, I don't even have an offical anxiety diagnosis. Anyway, I have just found out that my mother's insurance that she gets from her job will cover about 80% of the cost for a psychology diagnostic exam and we can finally pay for it!!! Sadly I have to wait until the fall because since I am graduating high-school next year, the universites where I live require like a note of a diagnosis within 12 months of graduating but it's better than nothing!

I somehow don’t feel like this is depression because I’m not really sad and I don’t feel like dying either, I just want peace and I don’t know how to achieve that. \n\nI put suicide thoughts as a trigger for others in case but it’s not something that I experience ",

I have a lot of different interests and want to pursue them all. The problem is, is that I have so many that I get overwhelmed/paralyzed and shut down completely… And then I either don’t do any of them. Or I will start many many things and will not fully follow through with any of them. In the process of starting those many many things I will sometimes spend a LOT of money on them bc I’m feeling so inspired…And then I get distracted by another interest and don’t actually use what I bought for the previous interest etc. And then I feel really badly about myself and ashamed.\n\nI don’t really know how to manage this behavior. I really do want to pursue all of my interests and I know that it is not possible… but how do I keep my focus and actually finish what I start? Like really commit even though my brain is in a million other places, wanting to do a million things simultaneously sometimes? And control the impulse to spend hundreds of dollars I don’t have on things I don’t follow through with? \n\nLots of negative self-talk at the moment. Does anyone have any thoughts about this’ll?",

    "body": "Hello, I (34M) recently decided that I needed to start working on being healthier and lose some weight. Based on professional Medical assessments I need to lose almost 200 pounds. \n\nI also have been diagnosed with ADHD, Depression, and Anxiety. \n\nPersonally I love to cook and try new recipes I love to make and eat super delicious food. I love cooking so much that I make 90% of the meals for my household.\n\nNow I may be totally off base here, but I think a big part of my overeating problem stems from the dopamine I get from eating tasty food. Once I really started tracking what I've been eating I noticed I used to eat/snack almost constantly. Now I am trying really hard to reduce my calorie intake because I have almost no time for exercise so the entire calorie deficit has to be diet based. So that means I eat less tasty food, less frequently, and in lower amounts. Which so far does seem to be helping me shed some weight. (13 pounds in 3 weeks) \n\nBut my side affect is that I feel like I'm spiraling. Even on great days I feel so down. I have seen/heard that ADHD can cause problems with our dopamine reception. Maybe that's totally wrong and if so please correct me. But it seems like I just can't seem to stop spiraling ever since I started eating less. I feel like I have to lose the weight because it's dangerous to my health to be so heavy, but I also feel like if I can't stop this spiral it will also be dangerous. So friends what do I do now? Any tips or tricks that you may have found to help?\n\n\nTLDR: I'm afraid that I was getting all my dopamine from overeating. Now that I'm not overeating I feel like mentally I'm spiraling.",

I'm 24 and I might not be too old but now I can't even read a page most of the times. My mind goes blank, i can't fully understand the sentences, no pictures forming in my mind, no excitement, nothing. I could read 10 pages and then realize I didn't absorb a single thing. Then read it again, get exhausted and leave it to never touch it again. \nIt's similar with movies and tv shows, although I can be idealizing the past with my nostalgia and forgetting about those recent times I was fully present. I feel like nothing excites me anymore. When I watch stuff with other people I can't recall the storyline, it's not fun to discuss a movie with me, it's awful and painful. I miss so many details that it's like I wasn't there, and in these occasions I can asure you my eyes are only on the screen. It feels so awful that I don't even want to get invited , I hate getting recommendations, to feel that pressure of having to watch something that yes, I could like, but no, I won't finish, won't make me feel that excitement I used to get (or i think i used to get, I'm not sure, maybe it wasn't never there). And by the way, there's nothing wrong with the people who recommends me stuff, I understand why they do it and that this is a me problem. \nWhy does this happens? Does anybody get this?

He love bombs me, but not in an unhealthy manner (he just is very positive all the time...almost toxically positive at times)....and that makes me uncomfortable, but not for the reason you think. \n\nIt makes me uncomfy bc my husband had been so so abusive and has told me over and over that I am worthless and a piece of garbage ... And his actions had said the same. He didn't physically abuse me past the time I had hauled off and hit him back, but he had still abandoned me and the kids, even tho he was still there. I hate him so fucking much...but I love him so fucking much more...even tho he's gone. I will never get to tell him how much I fucking hate him. How much he fucked my life up forever by being such a piece of SHIT GARBAGE human to me and his own fucking KIDS...they didn't do ANYTHING to you, and they didn't deserve your fucking disinterest and hate. \n\nAnyway, this guy is the exact opposite of that. No matter how much I push him away, he is still there supporting me and never EVER judging me. \n\nBut ... Here is the problem ... I can't love him like that. I can't...after what I've gone thru for the last half of my marriage and then all this bullshit going on in our country AND having fucking CANCER...I can't open my heart.

My physical health has plummeted and my mental health is almost at crisis levels bc of the stress of possibly LOSING MY ONLY INCOME. We will be homeless and we will starve if that happens...I won't be able to treat my cancer...\n\nI need some young people on here to give me guidance. I don't know how to let him in with how I'm struggling right now. He is so accepting of all my kids (not that it really was a factor in becoming involved with him, but it IS a nice perk!) and of all my bullshit. My mood swings ... All of it.😓 Even when I'm so mean to him ... He stays. (I apologize no worries, and I try to hold my tongue when I know I can't be an adult about something. Sigh...\n\nSorry to vent to y'all. I just am stuck and I can't break this shell I've built around me and I don't want to...not even with this guy who is nothing but good and loving to me. Help? I don't really want any kind of binding relationship ...but ... I'm also longing for connection...but what kind of connection...? How much? How to go about this? What if I say something or do something that scares him away? He has given NO indication of ever leaving me alone and lonely again...but I can't trust myself. I trust him to a point, but I don't trust MYSELF. \n\nOOOF. Help?🤣🤣🤣 I am 54 and I just lost my 29 years of marriage...I haven't dated since the early to mid 1990s...(Married 1994)...🤣🤣\n\nYes, younger generations...you can laugh st me. It's ok lol!

I can't get a diagnose or a therapist cause my parents are really unsupportive and if it came out to be anything more than like depression they'd probably call me crazy and disown me the moment I turn 18. I really have no other options nor anyone to help.\n\nBefore ppl start answering that it's just hormones; I WISH. I've been self-harming for 3 years now, stuck in an eating disorder for 2+ years, tried to commit suicide 2 times now, don't think hormones could cause all that 100%.\n\nI have no idea what could've caused any of these, it's like they just appeared there at some point, the only BAD thing that's ever happened to me is getting SA'd by a mentally disabled classmate like a year ago but my problems started WAYYY before that so it could've only made it a little worse. Despite what I said about my parents at the beginning they're not THAT bad. My mom was rather present during my childhood, my father wasn't completely absent either, I'd call it an average trad family. I don't have any childhood trauma that I can remember, yeah I got spanked occasionally but so have most of my peers so I don't think it caused any long-term issues. \n\nI already wrote most of the things I struggle with but the biggest problem (I think) are my intrusive thoughts (or at least I think that's what they are). I have thoughts of unspeakable things multiple times on a daily basis. Including stuff I shouldn't name here. And the worst thing is that they aren't just there, I'm ashamed to admit but more than often I find myself drilling into them. I know it's disgusting but I just can't stop. \n\nI'm even more scared considering the fact that I have VERY little self-control and literally anything triggers me. I go from 0-100 in seconds and there's nothing I can do about it. Someone annoys me a tiny little bit? I'm gonna hate their guts till I forget why I even hate them and bang my head against a wall out of frustration that I can't hurt them in any way because I'm literally a bag of bones. Sometimes I think that this and consequences are the only things holding me back from acting out on others instead of myself.\n\nAnother thing is that I noticed is that I don't feel empathy the same way others do and no I'm not trying to be edgy here. I know what's wrong and I know why but it's like I just KNOW it and don't FEEL it.\n\nIf that can be any relevant, no I don't have any friends, no I don't have anyone I can talk to. I've been isolating myself for 2+ years and I'm unable to talk to people causally, usually I end up blocking them after 2 days just because.\n\nBefore mods delete, I'm NOT asking for a diagnosis nor nothing of that sort, I'm looking for ways of help other than therapy that offer help for more than being shy or feeling down.

    "body": "As the title says, I am so slow. I am in university and have been working on an essay for my philosophy class which was due almost a month ago. I am very ashamed of this. This is no excuse, but I have been very depressed ever since the beginning of this semester (my second semester) and have not wanted to do anything besides go on TikTok (I have tried to discipline myself by setting a screen time limit to TikTok which fails as I always end up adding time to the limit) or sleep. This is odd because I actually did very well my first semester; I suspect this change is either due to the weather changing or because I went off of a medication (clomipramine) that I had been taking for a couple months as I started to think it was ineffective. Despite feeling like this I have aimed to work on the essay a couple hours each day, though sometimes I procrastinate and do not work on it. To be completely honest I do not want to work on it because I am so slow compared to others, and I feel like I have to waste so much more time working on it, just for it to be so bad compared to others. Today I timed how long it would take for me to rephrase a quote from the text I was discussing in the essay, it took me about 48 minutes, though I did get distracted at some points. For reference here is the quote and how I rephrased it:\n\nQuote: “…we make an agent the more responsible the more motives we can find for his conduct.”\n\nHow I rephrased it: The amount of motives that are found to contribute to someone’s decisions/actions justifies how responsible we find them for such decisions/actions. For example, when more motives are found behind someone's actions, we find that person more responsible for those actions.\n\nI am still in the process of getting my points together and rephrasing quotes, then I will need to create an outline, rough draft, and a final draft. It is so exhausting taking almost an hour to rephrase a quote and still be left unsatisfied by it. I hate to say it but I am so jealous of how others are able to make such amazing essays in such short amounts of time or how they can complete any schoolwork in such short amounts of time. It is so demotivating, saddening, and angering to take so long on this essay, and any schoolwork in general. I have decided to drop out of university but I am going to try my best to finish this semester passing all my classes. I am still unsure of what I want to do anyways - I do not really have anything I am interested in, or any career that I feel I would be able to succeed in. All this to say, I feel very hopeless about my future and I feel very ashamed of myself. This was just a vent really, I needed to get this out somewhere. Thanks if you stayed to read the whole thing, sorry if I blabbered too much.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "So I (22f) may be burnt out. I have been home for 2 years and trying to appear for certain things that have unfortunately not worked out for me. I thought they would and they didn't. The reason for me to suspect that I am burnt out is because I am perpetually tired and I tried all supplements B-complex, Vit-D, calcium, iron, etc and I am still where I am. I have difficulty coming up with words and I am an avid reader and I good speaker despite that I have difficulty coming up with basic words. Then there's the retention problem and a lack of empathy towards myself and others. I sometimes catch myself thinking really insensitive thoughts and very often I have to correct my response but I don't correct that response when it comes to myself. The most contributing factor has to be a lack of curiosity, I was a cinephile, liked to read and learn about things and people and now I can't physically get myself to do any of that at all. I just want yes or no answers idc whether there are nuances to the thing and I have no interest in learning anything new. \n\nI am also aware that MBTI may not be the best, but it gives me a background. I am an INTJ, which eventually leads me to have very high expectations of myself. However, these two years have been filled with failure, which has created a sense of cynicism, which I can push away at times. I am at the stage where I have been tirelessly studying up to no yield and still nowhere and I am unhappy with the stage I am at. If any other situation, I would've taken a good break but I stopped right now I may be stuck here. I also can't get myself to do the things anymore. Also, I am very prone to psychosomatic diseases and they have been flaring up way too much and headaches even, it could be because of my Instagram too but I don't know. I am sleeping more than usual so I don't see why I should have headaches or feel tired.\n\nadditionally, there was a sense of loneliness. I have been off Instagram when failure hit, initially, I thought ohhh I need to lock-in so gotta stay away but I think it maybe be because I am ashamed and last month I joined back and the feeling has intensified because people have moved forward. \n\nmy question is really what do I do? how do I get out of this burnout? do I take a few days off? what do I do in those free days? should I keep going?",

    "body": "Everything in my life has been negative lately. Everyday I wake up with impending anxiety, stress, depression, and doom. But I wake up each day with the intention of being a good human, of being better than I was yesterday. But I’m getting the point to where I can’t keep going on. Nothing inside of me has strength anymore. I’m typically the happy, go bubbly, optimistic type of person, but lately no part of me has been that way. \n\nI’ve never felt this unhappy and confused in my life. I can’t remember the last time I’ve laughed or smiled. Before anyone says anything- Yes I’ve been through a lot of crap- growing up with parents and a sibling with addiction problems, seeing multiple people die right in front of me, seeing my brother collapse and almost die infront of me from addiction while being told I was the reason why he’s alive and that I saved him, being cheated on, being bullied, having rumors made up about me, and so much more. But I’ve never felt the emptiness I do now. I go back and fourth between being so depressed that I dissociate to the point to where I’m completely numb or to where my depression consumes me. Yes before anyone asks, I’ve prayed, and I’ve tried to help myself but I don’t have the energy to try anymore. I have a family that treats me like shit. And a partner who turns on me and causes issues when I allow myself to feel emotions. The sad thing is, is that although they occasionally turn on me, it’s the most support I’ve ever received. I grew up in a family where mental health was stigmatized and I wasn’t allowed to talk about my feelings. I was also always both the punching bag growing up since I was the child who never got in trouble and the counselor of the family that was expected to resolve all of my family problems while also being there for adults while they were never there for me and would belittle me for having emotions or mental health issues.\n\nStill to this day, I feel like I can’t even have a panic attack around anyone else based on the horrible ways I’ve been treated from having them infront of other people. I’ve had people who are supposed to love me- mock my panic attacks, belittle & shame me, and yell at me for having them while simultaneously never comforting me. Anytime I’ve ever needed someone they leave when I need them the most, no matter who it is. Even when I was the sickest I’ve ever been in my life, my entire family abandoned me, and criticized me for being sick, just to get diagnosed with a lifelong disease that will impact me forever. I feel completely invisible.\n\nIn the short 9 months I’ve been engaged, I’ve had one of my brothers try to cancel/ruin my wedding, threaten not to come, name call me over & over again, my dad has fallen back into addiction, my parents have tried to force me to invite my brother who has made my entire engagement hell, and my dad has threatened not to come to my wedding as well since I don’t want to invite my brother who has done everything possible & imaginable to try to cancel and ruin our wedding. \n\nHow do I move forward? There’s so much more I want to say but it feels impossible to open up about it all. I’m so tired of being alone. ",

    "title": "Should We Bring Mental Health Institutions Back?/ Can Mental Health Institutions Solve the Crisis on Our Streets?",
    "body": "I've been thinking a lot about the state of mental health care in Canada. When you walk through any downtown area (in Toronto in my case), you can’t help but notice the growing number of people on the streets, many struggling with homelessness, addiction, and severe mental health issues.\n\nRight now, the mental health system isn’t enough to handle these cases. Community mental health services, while well-intended, aren’t equipped to deal with people in crisis. These individuals often need immediate detoxification, stabilization, and psychiatric intervention before they can begin therapy or cognitive restructuring. Instead, people are left without proper care, creating a flood of individuals on the streets who are severely neglected.\n\nI recently watched a video about an individual named Rabbit, a man with so much potential who tragically passed away a few years after documenting his journey through addiction and mental health struggles in Toronto. He faced homelessness, drugs, lack of support, and connection. His story is heartbreaking because it shows how easily someone can slip through the cracks in our system. Rabbit’s death isn’t just a tragedy - it's an example of how our current mental health care systems fail people in crisis.\n\nI also recently wrote a paper on the Belleville crisis, and it’s clear to me that we're in the midst of a serious mental health and addiction emergency in Canada\n\nThis is why I believe we need to bring back mental health institutions, but with a focus on recovery and rehabilitation. These institutions should be the first layer of care - providing stabilization and psychiatric support for people in acute crisis before transitioning them to community-based therapy. The goal should be recovery, not just managing symptoms or keeping people in institutions for extended periods.\n\n# How Could We Fund It Without Burdening Taxpayers?\n\nI get it - funding is the biggest issue. But I think we can find a way where taxpayers don’t bear the burden. Here’s how:\n\n* **Sin taxes** on substances like alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, and pharmaceutical companies. These industries make profits from addictions, so they should help fund the institutions that treat them.\n* **Gambling taxes** could also be a source of funding.\n* **Corporate responsibility programs** where large corporations contribute to mental health initiatives would help as well.\n\nThis way, we can recycle money from industries that contribute to mental health crises, rather than relying on taxpayers to foot the bill.\n\n# Why This Matters\n\n* We need better care for people with severe mental health and addiction issues. A layered approach - starting with stabilization in a mental health institution and moving to community-based therapy—could lead to better long-term outcomes.\n* Mental health institutions wouldn’t just help the individuals in crisis; they would also create more jobs in the mental health field. There’s a huge gap in the workforce, and many people with degrees in psychology are struggling to find work. This could help bridge that gap.\n* By reintegrating mental health care into institutional settings, we can give people a chance at recovery, rather than leaving them in a constant cycle of crisis.\n\nSo, what do you think? Is this idea too idealistic, or could it actually work?  ",

    "body": "I went to target and picked out birthday cards for my parents, siblings, and all my nieces and nephews for everyone’s birthdays next year. I was planning on killing myself after I filled them out. They lady at target who rang me out asked why I was buying so many (I have a big family) I told her I was dying and they’re for my family when I’m gone. I’m sure she thought I had cancer or something. But still. She started to get emotional and started crying then she made me cry. Telling me all kinds of nice things and that my family loves me very much 😭😭 we ended up hugging each other sobbing. After I collected myself in my car I decided to give it another shot just for her. She was so sweet. She indeed saved my life. So thank you to the target employee you have no idea how far your kind words reached ❤️ I am so grateful 🥲",

You’d think getting out would bring relief, a sense of safety—but all it brought me was emptiness. I thought once I escaped, I’d be able to feel again, to grieve for the lives lost, for the people I knew. But I feel nothing.\n\nI’m in a place far from the violence now, surrounded by people who are living normal lives. They go about their day, complaining about trivial things—traffic, their jobs, relationship problems. And I just stare at them. How do they not realize how absurd it all is? I survived hell, saw children torn apart in the streets, watched families disappear overnight, and now I’m expected to care about small talk? I don’t.\n\nEven after I got out, people wanted me to share my story, to talk about the horrors I escaped. But every time I do, I feel detached, like I’m telling someone else’s story. I describe the destruction, the bodies, the screams, but it feels like I’m reading from a script. I can’tonnect to it anymore. It’s like I left my emotions back there, buried under the rubble.\n\nI’ve lost all sense of empathy. When I hear about someone dying, even someone close, it doesn’t register. I didn’t cry when I found out a friend of mine didn’t make it out. I didn’t care when I heard about others losing everything. I go through the motions, pretending to sympathize, but inside, it’s just blank.\n\nPeople think escaping the genocide means survival, but it’s not true. Part of me died there, and the part that made me human never made it out. Now, when I see images of what’s still happening, or hear about others’ struggles, I can’t bring myself to feel anything. I walk past people begging for help, and I feel no urge to stop.\n\nI’m broken in ways no one can see. On the outside, I’m functioning. I smile, I work, I talk to people. But inside, I’m just as destroyed as the streets I left behind.\n\nIt’s been 5 months ",

They were fighting on the front porch while I was in the kitchen making a bottle for my 8 mo son who was sleeping in his crib on the other side of the house. After they were arguing, my dad walked in to the house, shut his bedroom door and shot himself in the head. I was right outside the door when it happened and I can’t get the sound out of my head. Luckily, my son slept through the whole thing and was quickly taken out of the house by his father while I called 911. My eyes hurt but I can’t sleep or close them with out everything replaying through my head. I feel like my life is in pieces and I don’t know what to do. That’s all I can really say...\n\nIf you need help, please get it.

Lived in some slummy apartments with no AC and barely had any grocery money. I usually bummed pizza from local Pizza shops at the end of the night when someone hadn’t picked up a carry out order. Sometimes I’d get something, sometimes I’d get told to fuck off. Got on average 3 hours of sleep aside from Saturday nights. Mental health was at an all time low.\n\nI made some changes that started with therapy. After that, I got a lucrative new sales job, love the people I work with, practice Muay Thai weekly, work out every day, and am in a much better place mentally. \n\nIf you think this post is about me rooting my own horn...

    "body": "As the title suggests, I think that 13RW is a very bad portrayal of mental health, suicide, depression etc. and it shouldn’t be promoted as a show that “raises awareness”, when it’s just harmful. It portrays suicide as something “beautiful” and “meaningful” and not what it really is. And the whole “blame it on other people even though they tried to help me” thing? Nope nope nope, that’s so toxic. Idk if I just feel that way because of my PTSD (an older guy blamed me for his suicide attempt because I didn’t “help him enough” even though I did everything I could and was only 13), but it’s just not really how suicide should be portrayed, in my opinion. Also, the way they show flashbacks of Hannah Baker from when she was alive makes it seem like she’s still alive in some way. They reeeeally push this harmful “suicide is something you choose as a weapon to hurt other people” agenda, when in reality, suicide is often the exact opposite. \nIdk, personally I really don’t like that show, and i think it’s harmful. I once opened up about my suicidal thoughts and depression to a friend, and she was all like “who made you feel that way?” like it was other people’s fault. Like sure, trauma and toxic relationships with people can worsen suicidal thoughts and depression but I just don’t feel like the show portrayed it in a helpful way.",

    "body": "I am usually the most positive, motivated, & outgoing person ever, but with COVID-19 affecting every aspect of my life, it wasn’t a surprise I became deeply depressed. I had been trapped in my apartment for months with no job, money, or motivation. My mentality started shifting to something more cynical as well. One night in particular though, my boyfriend helped catalyze me getting better. It was insanely difficult to get out of bed. Sure I’d get up maybe for an occasional snack or a quick bathroom break but I was just stuck mentally and physically, and in this case I hadn’t left my mattress for days. I wasn’t okay at all. Then one day out of the blue, my boyfriend went into my closet and grabbed me one of his t- shirts, (my) underwear, and (my) shorts. He propped me up and undressed, then dressed me while my eyes swelled up. He didn’t even ask. He just did it. Every time I think about that moment I tear up because it was the most intimate and sweetest thing anyone has ever done for me. I really am so lucky to have such a caring man in my life. I can’t wait to marry him some day. Our relationship is him doing the most selfless acts of love for me, and even though he might not think much of his actions, they mean the world to me. And for an update on my mental, I am doing incredibly better. Don’t want to go too in depth because he deserves all the love on this post. Thank you for reading. ♥️",

    "body": "My cousin recently killed herself. We were close when we were growing up. Her parents were extremely strict and had very high expectations of her, expectations she obviously felt she couldn't meet. \n\nI'm pissed off because in her memorial, not once did they mention it was a suicide. The closest thing I could find to an acknowledgement of that fact was in an obituary posted elsewhere online, where they said she \"succumbed to the pressures of COVID-19\" which is the most bullshit way to sugar-coat a suicide they could've come up with. As someone who has been very very close to taking my own life, having been hospitalized for that very reason just last year, it bothered me to my core that they pretended like it didn't happen. Just sang songs about god, beating around the bush and making it clear that she would be going to \"heaven\" and not \"hell\" even though everyone knows she did the big bad and committed \"sin\". No recognition at all for the pain she had obviously been dealing with silently for her entire life.\n\nI posted on her memorial site, just a quick blurb of some memories I had with her, a nice photo of us when we were young,  and I quick sentence at the end basically saying \"Some of us face our struggles silently, and you never know who could be fighting an invisible battle, so always be there to lend a shoulder to someone, whether they ask for it or not.\" And I linked NAMI and the suicide hotline. \n\nThey fucking deleted my post and asked me to take all references to suicide or struggles out. They reached out to my parents too to try and reign me in. \n\nI'm honestly appalled. They seem embarrassed and ashamed of her, and they want to hide what she did because it makes them look bad in the \"eyes of God\". Fuck man. Wouldn't even let a supportive message and a link to NAMI slip in there. Had to be clean and without any reference to mental health whatsoever.\n\nI feel so bad for her. If her parents made \\*me\\* feel this invalidated in one fell swoop, I can't imagine what her life was like with them.\n\nJust needed to vent, thanks for reading.",

You may think i’m making this up but i’m not i swear.\nTonight I held a knife to myself, and my cat ran to my side. At first I thought he was just trying to cuddle or get me to pet him, but I then noticed instead of rubbing into my hand, he was pushing the knife away. I broke down into tears and he immediately climbed into my lap. I moved and he laid beside me, and now refuses to let me out of his sight. His little paw is sitting on my arm, and when i move he moves. This is insane, but he stopped it, if it wasn’t for my cat i’d be dead. I can’t thank him enough, he’s my angel baby. I love him so much.\n\nUpdate: I’m better, I decided to stay for him. Mentally I’m not okay, but I’m working on myself and I will get better soon. Thank you all for the love and support! Ive been getting more love from strangers than I get from friends and family. It means the world to me.❤️\n\nEdit: I will not be showing pictures of my cat. Not in a mean way, but in a way for my privacy. I came on here to be “anonymous” in ways, just so if someone i personally know comes across this they can’t tell it’s me.

    "body": "I woke up exhausted, feeling like sand was holding me down. \n\nBut I knew the sand wasn’t real. I was capable of being a function human, so I decided to be one. I got out of bed, showered and brushed my teeth, I put on clothes and left the house briefly to shop. And then I binge ate crap food, drank vodka, watched 10 hours of tv whilst taking lots of pain meds for back trouble. \n\nI’m not really sure what I’m trying to say. I guess I want people to know that I tried. I fought back at my body and forced myself up, forced myself to do the bare minimum of existing and damnit - I was so proud. I want the satisfaction of ‘doing the healthy thing’ even though it was hard, and then I want the reward to be a sudden ability to live easily. \n\nBut it didn’t come. I gave in to the dull ache of sadness and consumed sugar, salt and digital crap until I felt sick. I’m back in bed now thinking about every mistake I made today and how I wish I was stronger. \n\nI know that a path back to a healthy mental space/ lifestyle is going to be a long, hard road after neglecting it for so long. And I know I have to do it, and do it now before it deteriorates further. I just wish it wasn’t so intensely challenging. I wish that I didn’t have to eat healthily, exercise, keep a tidy house, be social JUST TO STAY AFLOAT.\n\nMissing a run means missing on the happy endorphins I rely on to keep me going through the day. Having an unhealthy meal makes me sluggish, that in turn makes me feel that tiny bit worse which is enough to make me not do chores. I hate being in such a fragile state where i’m not quite mega-depressed, just always on the verge of not leaving my bed for 48 hours. \n\n\nTL:DR Life is hard, I like easy things. Nothing worthwhile comes easily.",

It was just me and my roommate going about our usual routine, and life just seemed so... bleak. Then my friend asked if I could babysit his kitten and it was a game changer. I found out cuddling, nuzzling, feeding and caring for a cat was so rewarding and realized how special the bond between cats and humans are. So I adopted my own kitten a few weeks later, and we fell instantly in love with each other. I have so much time to appreciate the little moments between us, to watch him grow, and to witness our bond grow stronger everyday because we spend so much time together. Not only that, but I feel more confident in reaching out to my friends and family on social media/phone again because I don’t feel alone anymore. I would say if you are feeling alone or you are looking for a sense of purpose during this time, I highly recommend getting a pet, because this is a rare occasion where your bond with your pet will be stronger than ever. If you want to follow my cat on IG, I post almost every day and you can watch him grow too. @finn_the_feline_._._\n\nTLDR; Adopted a cat during quarantine, and our bond continues to grow rapidly day by day.

There is a light. \n\n3 years ago, my family home was foreclosed on. 2 years ago my mom had a stroke and was paralyzed and left unable to speak. 3 months ago she passed away after a long battle. I haven’t been able to speak to my best friend for 2 years and now I’ll never be able to. \n\nWithin that time, I had two suicide attempts. I was on pills. I was drinking alone everyday. I was hospitalized. I was uninsured. I was homeless. I thought I was beyond repair. \n\nFor two years now since then, I’ve been in therapy. Every week for two years. \n\nNow, I’m engaged. An awesome step son. I have a good job. A nice place to live. I’m excited for the future. \n\nTherapy saved me. But not my therapist. \n\nMy therapist is amazing. He’s smart. Insightful. Knows when to listen. But when I started therapy, I thought my therapist would just tell me what to do. I’d do it. And I’d be fixed. \n\nThat’s not how it worked for me. \n\nA lot of my friends who aren’t in therapy have been afraid to, or too stubborn to go seek help. \n\nThey think they know better than a professional. BUT HERES THE RUB: My therapist didn’t know how to fix me. \n\nI did. \n\n(For me personally) therapy has been about bringing out repressed thoughts and feelings. Things I couldn’t talk to my friends about. Couldn’t talk about with my family.\n\nTherapy also made me take accountability. For all my mistakes, the people I’ve wronged.\n\nI can now accept my past and look to the future. A future I wanted to take away from myself. \n\nI hope if even one person reads this and feels inclined to help themselves. Because you can. \n\nP.S. I’m new to Reddit. And I like it a lot.

Despite sending me a pic that is at least 20 years old I do recognise him. He denies being a therapist and said he was using somebody else’s face pic blah blah blah. He then blocks me!

It's literally the same phrases every time. It's like they are a bunch of robots. So goddamn repetitive and predictable.

I would like to say that I am not from the USA I’m from Belgium still thanks for your advice because a lot of it still applies here and they might have helped someone from the USA.

    "body": "Although I myself still struggle after being raped nearly 2 and a half years ago (and the rape will impact me my whole life) I want to let you know that time really heals wounds.\n\nAfter, I got raped it was the worst time in my life. There are no words to describe how horrible it was. From a person who was very confident, lived in multiple countries, travelled the world I was afraid to go to my local grocery shop. I nearly had a panic attack when I was alone with a man in a shopping aisle. I had to postpone all my exams, my academic and social life suffered immensely. I had PTSD, anxiety, depression etc. I had very dark thoughts. I considered taking a year out of university because just getting out of bed was a struggle for me. I could write a book about all the negative effects of rape.\n\nBut now I honestly feel so much better. Of course, I still suffer the effects. But compared to the past I have made great progress. I am planning to continue my therapy though as I feel like my healing process is not over.\n\nBut I want to let you know that things will get better. I have graduated from top 30 university in the world with a prestigious degree, last year I was a committee member of multiple societies at my university. I am looking forward to life.\n\nOne thing I would tell you is that don’t put a timeline or deadline for your recovery. And don't compare yourself to others. I used to wonder will I ever get better. Why I am not getting better already? Why is it taking so long? Don’t compare your recovery to someone else. Although I will recover the whole of my life, what I mean is that If you are not getting better/progressing in a certain period of time is okay.\n\nEveryone is different and take as much time you need to heal.\n\nFor me, it was also hard to see all my friends enjoying life and this tragedy happening to me. But now I am slowly accepting that life didn’t turn out exactly the way I wanted. And bad things happened to good people.\n\nI am posting this because I felt much better myself reading stories of rape victims that persevered and ‘overcame’ their trauma.\n\nI am wishing you nothing but the best. And please don’t give up. Life is beautiful, even if it does not see this way now.",

    "body": "I absolutely hate the so-called \"psychologists\" on tik tok and instagram. They often take general things that could apply to almost anyone and try to claim they're a result of mental illness. They'll title a video something like \"10 signs you might have bipolar\" and then list things like \"You like to hang out with friends sometimes, but others you prefer to spend time to yourself\", or \"Its hard for you to stay focused on just one hobby\". Plus, they have a bad habit of labelling EVERYTHING as a \"trauma response\". You're a picky eater? Trauma. You get nervous around crowds? Trauma. Theyll even say that PRETENDING to have trauma is a sign of trauma. It seriously pisses me off, because what they're doing is causing great harm to those who actually struggle with mental health. It delegitimizes the experiences of those with mental illness, and it makes a lot of people assume that mental illness' aren't actually too big a struggle to have.",

    "body": "13 Reasons Why has always been controversial from the start. I understand where people come from when they say the first season glorified suicide. Personally, I believe the first season had good intentions, and truly was trying to raise awareness for suicide.\n\nOf course, they completely sabotaged Hannah Baker’s character in S2, which had a detrimental effect on the message.\n\nBut Season 4 - oh, it makes my blood boil. Clay’s undiagnosed, undefined “mental illness” - at best described by the show as “trauma” - is used as an excuse for outrageously bad behavior. By bad behavior, I mean locking his friends in a cabin in the woods and clanging an axe against the door. I mean vandalizing his school and burning his principal’s car. I mean waving a gun around in front of the entire student body.\n\nAnd worst of all, when he finds out his adoptive brother is dying, his immediate response is to run to the police station and yell, “I’ve got a gun!” Why? Because he needed people “to see how broken he was.”\n\nThis one really hit me close to home. When I was 6, my infant sister had to spend all 4.5 months of her life on a ventilator in the hospital. When she died - near Christmas time - I did not go terrorize people so that they could see “how broken I was.”\n\nYet [few people](https://youtu.be/ynewf90xWZc) see it that way. When I say this, 13 RW fans tell me “Well, you were 6. Your emotions were not as deep as our beloved FICTIONAL character Clay.”\n\nI hate what that show became, and the perverse effect it has.\n\nEDIT\n\nThank you for all of the heartfelt responses and experiences you have shared. I truly had started to believe I was in the minority with my critique of 13 Reasons Why. I’m glad to know there are others who share the same concerns.",

Ever since I could remember I would hear them having sex at night while they thought I was sleeping. We went through a lot of houses in the time this happened. I'm currently 17 and the first time I recall hearing her doing this was when we lived with my aunt shortly after my parents broke up and I shared a room with my mom. She would almost every night have sex and I would have to sit there for what felt like hours covering my ears. Then we eventually started living in a camper and it would happen so much the whole camper would shake and all I would hear was the noises. Now we live in a house, and at least we have our own rooms but I still hear them because the walls are so thin and they leave the door open. I bring this up because I cannot and never have been able to have a healthy sexual relationship with myself without thinking of them having sex. The noises and the shaking. I just wanted to tell this on here because this is the only way I feel like I can anonymously say it and I just want some help because it still happens to this day and I just wonder if it's trauma or if I'm just being overly dramatic.\n\nEDIT: I would also like to add I know it is my mom's right to have sex.

    "body": "When I had a predictable schedule, my cat would make sure I followed it to the letter every morning.\n\nHe woke me up right before my alarm so there was time for me to pet him. Then would hop off and meow until I got out of bed. Then led me to the bathroom, and would wait on top of the toilet until I was done showering. If I took longer than ten minutes he’d start meowing. Then he’d sit on top of my counter and watch me brush my teeth, and try to grab the floss as I was using it. Then he would hop down and strut in front of me, looking behind to make sure I was following, and lead me to my bag. Once I picked up my bag, he’d lead me downstairs to the kitchen. He would then sit on one of the chairs and watch me cook and eat breakfast, and when I was getting all ready to leave, he would wait for me to walk over and pet him goodbye for the day.\n\nWhen I got home, he’d be waiting for me. He’d lead me back upstairs and stand in the spot my bag’s supposed to go. Then we’d play fetch with toy balls and I’d give him lots of pets until we tired out. Then I would get on the computer for work and games, and he’d hop into his cat bed nearby and fall asleep. When it was time for bed, he sometimes even got up to lead me to the bathroom and make sure I was brushing my teeth, then go back to bed.\n\nSince the pandemic started, I’ve had nowhere to go. Nothing to do. And even several months later, I can tell he misses the routine. He still tries to wake me up on time. He’s been trying different tactics. The most effective one so far seems to be bringing a toy and doing cuddle rolls just out of reach of the bed so I have to get up to pet him. He still meows if I’m in the shower for more than ten minutes. When I do finally go downstairs, he rushes ahead of me halfway down and leads me the rest of the way. He frequently makes circles around my feet as I’m on the computer, asking for pets and playtime. It breaks me heart when he does these things. I know he’s trying so hard.\n\nLiterally the most caring individual when it comes to me taking care of myself is my cat. But lot of his effort goes in vain, and it wracks me with guilt and appreciation every morning to watch him try.",

    "body": "So I hit rock bottom months ago, but I brought a shovel with me and I’ve been getting worse and worse. I wrote my suicide note this morning and my plan was to take my pistol and end it all tonight when I got home from work. I had everything planned and I was set. Then this evening I was at work delivering pizzas. I went to this one house and I wasn’t sure if I was at the right address or not but there was a man in the driveway and I asked him if I was at the right address. He said he wasn’t sure because it was his bosses house, not his, and he was only there to pick up his car. Then we started talking and he mentioned how I was smiling. He spoke about how he was 63 years old, he was a military veteran, and how with people my age he doesn’t see people smile like I did. It was a fake smile I put on so when I greet customers it’s a good experience. But he picked up on my smile, we chatted and he was making me laugh, he ended up giving me a big hug and was telling me how I should appreciate my friends, my family, and life. This guy had no clue I was depressed and suicidal and was planning on taking my life 3 hours later, yet he still told me all of this. He ended up giving me some cheese he had (I didn’t eat it) but the reason why he gave it to me is because  the packaging had a huge smile on it and he told me to have it and to keep on smiling and spreading positivity. \n\nThis guy was only at the house to pick up his car, he was only there for 5 minutes, yet in that 5 minutes is when I showed up. If that delivery was 5 minutes earlier or 5 minutes later I would have already taken my life, but the timing was perfect, and I’m still here. I’m not a super religious person, but I truly believe this man was my saving grace, he was sent by god to let me know it’s not my time to go. I gotta keep fighting. \n\nI got his bosses phone number from the side of the work truck that was sitting in the driveway and I plan on calling him tomorrow and letting him know this story and asking him to thank his employee for me. \n\nGod is real and he sent this man to save my life",

If people are so worried over others faking this stuff for pity, then maybe don't give them pity and that's the problem solved then? Instead of giving them the things you think they're faking problems to get, try to push them to see professional help and leave it at that instead of going out of your way to make it worse for them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNobody should be allowed to do terrible things and get away with it by blaming their disorder, I get that. If someone you know is doing that, treat it like the law does: don't punish or hate them, but maybe send them to a psych ward to get help if they truthfully are harming others because they can't control themselves.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf anyone out there is afraid to come out about a struggle of theirs because they're afraid of being called an attention seeker, don't hold back because of people like this. Know that bottling it up will make it worse over time. Tell someone that will understand (maybe a school psychologist or a doctor) before it becomes too severe to fix easily.

Is it due to my mental issues that existed before cancer? Is it because I’ve changed so much? I feel the most broken I’ve ever felt in my entire life. I don’t even feel like the same person I was before, I’ve been so broken and damaged. I do a lot of “distracting,” keeping myself occupied watching YouTube and playing video games so I’m not sad all the time but when I’m left alone with my thoughts I just get sad. I’m trying to find a therapist right now so hopefully some of this will be improved. I just don’t really understand why I’m still sad when things are turning around and getting better!",

    "body": "Of course the main problem with Instagram and mental health is the fake lifestyles which people see everyday, but I find I also hate most of the things I see on Instagram about mental health. Every day I see posts making anxiety seem like a trendy thing to have, and making it seem like overcoming depression is a necessary factor of a success story. \n\nAnd the amount of times I’ve seen people sharing posts about mental health on their stories or pages, things like “make sure you check up on your friends”, now I don’t know about you but practically none of the people who post things like that I have had check on me, whether in person or over message, and nor have I seen them check on others. Makes me think that all these kind of posts are a way of creating an even more ideal image of ones self purely for social acceptance.",

    "body": "I have had an insane life full of dark trauma, abuse, alcoholism, suicide, despair, extreme loss, stalking, harassment, and destitution. For years I wanted to die and I begged my mother for permission to die to end my suffering. I literally got my brain zapped 14 times to fight it (ECT is actually very safe and effective for severe treatment resistant depression). But all those labels don't matter.\n\nSo let me tell you a few things: \n\n1. Your suffering is as equally valid as mine. \n2. Everything is relative. You can have an amazing life and still be suffering.\n3. Your suffering does not need justification. You feel what you feel. Screw invalidating statements like \"It's just hormones\".\n4. We all have our own journey don't compare your life/struggles to those of others.\n5. You deserve growth as a human being even if you don't feel like you do. Our illnesses cloud our perspective of the past, present, and future.\n6. Don't believe everything you think.\n7. There is no \"cure\". Suffering is part of human existence and by learning to accept it and sit with it we can overcome it.\n\n\np.s Now I have more happy days than depressed days. It took awhile and I never thought I would get here but I am so thankful. I am much better person for it.",

    "title": "Would someone take the time to wish me a happy birthday? I don't have anyone and don't want to feel so alone today.",
    "body": "Today is my birthday and this sounds pretty sad, but I just want someone to wish me a happy birthday and maybe say something nice. I no longer have any friends or family left and just want some sort of human connection, even if it is just over Reddit, to make me feel just a bit less isolated and forgotten.\n\nI have just endured so much lately and I don't have anyone to talk to or confide in, but I thought I could make it through today just fine. I was wrong. I feel stupid and pitiful while I'm typing this, but I just want to know someone is out there and understands.Getting to this point happened without me even realizing how solitary I had become until I was completely alone. I might as well lay it out, as just the act of typing it might be some sort of catharsis.\n\nSo how did I end up here? I started typing out damn near my whole life story, but that made this post so long that if I left it included there was an even smaller chance someone would read this. So highlights then? Abandoned by parents, raised by grandparents, abused by neighbor from ages 5 to 8, horrible abandonment issues, started getting into drugs, dropped out of high school, got a GED, some life happened, was totally Goth, some more life happened, made some music and art, now only Goth on the inside, started college, got married, wife left and grandparents arrested/institutionalized due to Alzheimer's/dementia in the same weekend, abruptly left college to move home to sort everything out, oh hey drugs, slowly watched my only family deteriorate before my eyes until they didn't even recognize me any longer, raging heroin addiction to try not to feel any of this, grandfather died, got in trouble with the law, lost everything I owned, homeless junkie interlude, lost almost 3 years of my life in jail/prison over less than $4,000 worth of bad checks, oops can't get a decent job due to criminal record, congestive heart failure, almost die, start getting my life back together, meet a nice girl, marry nice girl, grandmother dies, oh hey again drugs, finally got off the drugs, surprise wife departure, heart failure keeps getting worse, can barely walk, can't work anymore, no job, no insurance, no access to healthcare.\n\nThat about sums it up the backstory. I finally have gotten some healthcare and counseling. Sadly, I can no longer work. I'm trying to go through the disability process, but that takes a great deal of time. It is difficult without proper access to the doctors I need, but I'm getting there. I've also been clean for 4 years and I'm never going back to that dependence. Never before in my life did I ever feel like I was completely done with drugs, but this time it has really stuck. Haven't even had any cravings and now it never even crosses my mind. I'm finally in a good and stable place in my recovery.\n\nNow I have other issues though. Poverty is very real. The threat of eviction looms nearly every month. Being able to afford the 12 different prescriptions I take is really hard and I find myself cutting pills in half because even $70 a month for medicine is a real challenge. I was able to get enrolled back in college and that is the plan of how to survive until I graduate and find work I'm physically able to handle. I'm working towards a career in counseling because I want to be able to use all of these nightmare experiences to help other people. I want to use what time I have left on this planet to help others and hopefully leave it better than I found it.\n\nThat is how you end up alone on your 40th birthday, typing on an ancient laptop that you pray survives a couple more months until you transfer schools and can get a replacement with financial aid funds. My family died. Drugs pushed everyone away for years except other drug addicts and an addict isn't anyone's friend. I am no longer able to work, so I don't have those human connections anymore. My wife had been my best friend, so when she surprised me by suddenly leaving the last person I had a connection with went with her. Now that my congestive heart failure has progressed just walking enough to shop for groceries, take out the trash, or getting the mail is a huge challenge, so just going out to walk around and meet people is near impossible. Having zero available disposable income also doesn't help. If I can hold on a couple more months and everything works out I'll be able to switch schools and have more aid options that will take care of my financial and healthcare needs. I'm just trying to hold on and it is so hard.\n\nThere is the abbreviated story if you somehow stopped on this post and actually read through everything. If you made it this far, thank you for listening. If you have the time to say happy birthday or say something nice I would really appreciate it. You really don't know how much it would mean to me. No one else is going to tell me today, so you might get to be the only person that wishes me a happy birthday. I don't get any presents or any cake. I don't get a birthday meal or get to do anything cool. I don't get to go anywhere or see anyone. There won't be any birthday cards in the mail or celebratory emails. That's okay though. If one person manages to take the time to read this and let me know there is someone, anyone out there then it'll be alright.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Update - Thanks so much to everyone. I barely have any words. Just thank you all so very much. You did bring a grown man to tears, but the best kind. I haven't had anyone say anything this nice to me in years and just reading through these comments is the single best thing I've experienced in a long time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate 2. I am speechless. I've read every comment. Tried to respond to every chat, but I have to get back to bed for now. I just wanted to thank everyone again. All of you helped turn my birthday into an amazing and memorable experience. From the very bottom of my humbled heart, thank you.",

I hate to imagine the pain he was in. Everyone around me keeps mentioning him and I can’t handle it. We grew up together and now he’s gone. I went to a pawnshop nearby my school while i was waiting for my brother and i met the dad of one of my friends who was also really close to my friend who died.

Feeling like I have some form of control on my life again is something I never saw myself being able to achieve.. To anyone else with this feeling, you can get there. It's hard and relapses happen and sometimes all you wanna do is turn back but once it's gone, you'll never feel better.",

I've become an EMT, I'm finishing up my dual degree in computer science and mathematics, my relationships with the people who matter most to me are at an all time high. I have self-worth, confidence, I'm making healthier physical health and mental health choices, I'm achieving all of my dreams and aspirations...and I'm happy. I'm genuinely happy. I compared how I am doing this summer to last summer, and the improvement is MAGNIFICENT. I now enjoy life and see that there is SO much to live for.\n\nIt's tough at times. Sometimes it gets really lonely, dark, empty....lifeless...but that's not true. Your life is full of life because YOU'RE alive. You have so much potential. You just need to tap into it. I did it... and I'm finally in a better place after 5 years of a shit storm - you can, too! I promise! (: Hang in there friend. No matter how long the fight takes - stay in that ring.

    "body": "When I was around 10 years old, I watched my teenage brother nurse a wound. He was crying as he soaked his scraped knee with water in the bathtub.\n\nI looked at him with disdain. \"Why are you crying?\" I asked in annoyance. I didn't realize it then, but my visceral reaction to his emotional vulnerability reflected something that I had been taught earlier in my childhood: boys aren't supposed to cry. \n\nWhen I became a young adult, I had a lot of trouble expressing my emotions. I put on a smile for everyone I saw, and avoided talking about anything that would trigger an emotional reaction. When my emotions built up to the point where I couldn’t control them, I would explode. It took a long time to learn how to share my feelings - something that people still consider to be a sign of weakness in men.\n\nI think I’m one of the millions of men out there who’ve been told, at some point in their lives, to repress their emotions. I now understand how emotional repression can lead to a variety of complications in mental health. I wrote a song to challenge the idea that men shouldn’t show their feelings simply because they are men. Listen link below.\n\nFor all the guys out there listening to this song - be vulnerable. Feel your emotions. Share with others how you feel. I think that’s even more manly than being a tough guy.\n\nThank you guys so much for reading this. Please be safe, everyone. xoxo\n\nListen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VzIeM6u2Zc",

Shared with the staff my story and how I was going to be homeless that same day, but since it is a small city, the social worker contacted a friend of hers that owned a place that was looking for a woman to cook, clean and receive guests at a private tourist attraction.  \n\nAlthough I'm male, she decided to give me a chance, and so it has been two weeks of hard work but everything is working out so far. I actually like the job a lot, and my employer seems to be quite happy with my performance and already increased my salary from past week. \n\nMy anxiety and depression are way under control now. It seems that since my work requires more doing and less thinking it just keeps my mind better focused in the job and been glad for this opportunity that while I still get some intrusive thoughts once in a while, they are way less aggressive than they were in the past few months/years.\n\nSo that is it. Just sharing a story with a better ending than I expected so that, maybe, it give those of you guys who are still facing harder times, a glimmer of hope that things may get better for you too.

After a split second of worrying I may be stepping into a domestic violence and, thus, dangerous situation, I knew I needed to help either way. So I ran up and said I could help. That's when I realized she was holding a non-responsive, not breathing baby. Time slowed down. I stashed my dog inside her front door, took the baby, and narrated each step of heimlich, sweeping the mouth, etc. I was eerily calm. And the baby started crying! I had to do it a second time when she stopped breathing again. Meanwhile, the woman who was her grandmother was on the phone with 911 and, understandably, in such a panic. The police came first, because neighbors called about the screaming. Then the ambulance a bit after that and a good 5-10 minutes after I got there. I feel so so lucky I happened to be there and somehow remembered lifeguard training from 15 years ago. And I feel humbled in like a pre-social media definition of it. And I feel weird that all the other neighbors were watching but no one came to help. And most of all, I just feel raw. Like I feel really weird about it all and like I'm exposed.

Also invested in a skipping rope to get the blood pumping. I've been watching a lot of Jordan Peterson lectures lately. In the past I used to waste my time aimlessly but now I can learn to manage my time and also increased the productivity. Hardly use any sort of social media other than YouTube. I can see that implementing these habits in my lifestyle , my mental health is improving as I'm keeing myself engaged and investing my time into things that are benefical and will pay off in the long run. I encourage you to do the same. You are loved and you matter 💕. Stay safe & stay strong 💪 😊\n\nI have a YouTube channel about Mental Health and self care 📍My video is called \"𝘼𝙉𝙓𝙄𝙀𝙏𝙔 𝙍𝙀𝙇𝙄𝙀𝙁 : 𝙬𝙝𝙮 𝙬𝙚 𝙘𝙧𝙖𝙘𝙠 𝙪𝙣𝙙𝙚𝙧 𝙥𝙧𝙚𝙨𝙨𝙪𝙧𝙚\" 📍Do check it out as it can be of some help to you 😊❤\nhttps://youtu.be/VBJLOVFcdxU",

I feel like an absolute idiot. \n\nI had this grand plan when I left highschool. I wanted to study outside of the US. It was really difficult to find a way to do it, but I had a dream and I was so determined to accomplish it. But depression hit me bad and I almost didn't graduate highschool, my parents didn't support me and I wasn't able to go to college because of it so I was forced to take a gap year. I broke my foot and was bed ridden for 6 months and became very depressed. Finally got to uni and failed the first year. Just failed my 2nd. I'm basically at 0 credits and 3 years behind where I'm supposed to be. My twin brother is almost graduating and I'm basically exactly where I was when I left highschool. I feel like I'm losing years off my life and for some reason I can't just live it.\n\nNot to mention there's a lot of shitty things going on on top of all this and I just feel so fucking alone.

    "body": "I saw someone on my friends list post about someone they knew who committed suicide being selfish and I am not in the mood to play around about this. Let me fucking tell you something. I am so sick and tired of hearing people say that suicide is selfish. You want to know what's fucking selfish? Expecting someone else to live for you. Expecting someone to put their own personal pain to the side for your fucking happiness. Expecting your relationship or companionship to be that saving grace to pull anyone through a deep depression. THAT is the epitomy of selfish. It is no one's responsibility to do anything that makes other people happy or comfortable. You are not owed any of that. You don't get to tell someone who's suicidal that they're selfish for considering it and that they should think about others egos before their suffering. You don't get to call someone selfish after they commit suicide because they didn't think about everyone else's feelings when they obviously couldn't even handle their own. On top of the fact that it's disrespectful to speak ill of the dead. How selfish do you have to be to have the audacity to call someone selfish when you are the one who wants a dangerously depressed person to continue suffering just so you can continue to ignore all the symptoms but hand them a god damn gold start sticker for being alive like it fucking helps anything? And before you even bring religion into the conversation, news flash, Not everyone believes in your God so telling someone \"God doesn't make mistakes\", \"Suicide is a sin\", \"God only gives us what we can handle\", or some other idiotic bullshit, doesn't bring everyone comfort and sometimes it makes things worse. And that's not your opportunity to tell them all the ways they need to find God. Because again: Not. Everyone. Believes. In. Your. Fucking. God. End of. Telling a suicidal person that wanting to end their pain is selfish will only tell them that they cannot confide in you and it marks you as an unreliable support system. It will more than likely make them pull away from you and make them feel even more isolated. YOU'RE NOT HELPING! And don't use the excuses \"I've been through worse and I don't want to kill myself\" or \"Other people have it worse\" because you obviously don't understand what mental illness is. Being depressed about a situation is so much different than being clinically depressed. Situational depression lasts through a particular struggle. Clinical depression is being sad for almost no god damn reason. Don't compare the two because you're only making yourself look like more of an asshole. It is selfish of you to want someone to continue suffering just to make you happy. Get off your fucking high horse.",

    "body": "Can the media stop glamorizing this notion that battling mental illness is beautiful or trendy?\n\nI’m all for expressing emotions in a healthy manner and using music as an emotional outlet, and certainly want to hear music that is honest... but not at the cost of minimizing the pain and struggles that people all over the world face on a daily basis. \n\nBeing broken is not beautiful, being broken is sobbing uncontrollably when you have a delay getting your meds refilled while your boyfriend strokes your hair trying to convince you that things will get better. \n\nAddiction is not the modern day version of Romeo and Juliet, addiction is an stable & irreversible at best or a death sentence at worst. \n\nStaying in an abusive relationship is not “being loyal to your man/woman” and you’re not better than anyone else for “fighting through the bullshit” - you’re suffering from Stockholm Syndrome and I hope to God you get out soon. \n\nBeing sad is not cute and I don’t want to wear it on a hat.\n\nEDIT: If you’re in a position of influence, big or small, use that influence to encourage others to seek help and get better, not falsely celebrate being somewhere no wants to be.",

    "body": "Somehow I missed my 10 year anniversary of the worst day of my life. I suppose that’s a good thing that I’m so involved with the good bits of life now that I almost forgot that this wasn’t always the case. \n\nTen years ago I threw my legs out a 6th floor window at college, intending to hit the earth below me. I was in the thick of some really terrible times then. I was 19, heartbroken, homesick, lost, and very confused. I remember the sharp air that rushed in the room when I opened the window that very cold and snowy February night. It felt like little needles on my skin; a stark contrast to the hot, salty tears streaming down my face. I was in trouble for drinking on campus...again.  However, the drinking wasn’t just purely fun and games. I was using it to cope with a lot of uncertainty and hopelessness. My on again off again boyfriend told me he was dating someone else. He lived with my best guy friend at the time so a lot of “sides” were taken in the whole mess. And somewhere along the way my roommate moved out. I was alone. \n\nI spent the remainder of the week at the hospital under psychiatric care. The days I spent there blur together now. I was in such a haze of numbness. \nMy entire life was uprooted. I got kicked out of college and I had to start over somewhere new. The next several years were spent kicking my ass into gear to show myself and the friends who abandoned me that they didn’t get the best of me. I pushed and pushed myself. I started looking forward and not backward. I learned to love myself again. Slowly. Very slowly. \n\nI graduated from a new (and better) college with honors two years later. I took a chance and bought a one way ticket to NYC and began living the life I used to only be able to dream about.\n\n10 years later, I am living proof that things get better. Depression and anxiety are challenges I still deal with occasionally, but now I know how to handle it. \n\nRight now I’m sitting in the house I just bought all by myself. I’m reminiscing about the years I spent living and working in Manhattan, where I had an incredible job and amazing friends. Most days, my life felt like a happy movie. I recently decided to re-locate, slow things down and enjoy the present. Now I’m in the process of renovating my house from the inside out. I volunteer with an organization that raises funds for underprivileged women and children. I carve out time for my hobbies, friends, and loved ones. I’ve truly become a better person. I can now enjoy a glass or two of wine without overdoing it just to cope. I can take a deep breath, a small sip, and appreciate how far I’ve come.\n\nI still have a long way to go. I’m still a work in progress. I haven’t found love yet but I look forward to the day I do. In the meantime, you can catch me cultivating my new herb garden and reading a good book or two. \n\nIf you’re going through what I went through 10 years ago, my best advice is to hang on, know it does get better (and no this isn’t something that people just say. It’s true). You’re not alone. You’re loved. And you’re stronger than you think.\nTake a deep breath, be thankful that you are able to do so, and repeat until you truly believe better days are around the corner.\n\nTLDR - I’m 10 years post-suicide attempt and better than ever. I wanted to share my accomplishment with you all and hope this story might help someone.",

I enjoy eating in my bed. I feel safe in my bed.\n\nWhen I was younger I didn't spend all my time in bed because I had friends and activities to do. I could sit upright in chairs without being in pain. I don't know how to live like that anymore. It's been almost a decade since, I'm not familiar with it.\n\nFor fun I crochet in bed. I draw in bed. I watch videos in bed. I get a dopamine rush when I think about all the fun things I could do with my life. I fantasize about how good I would have it if I had friends and didn't rot away in bed everyday.\n\nI don't know if this is hope or delusion. I make an effort not to lay in bed all day sometimes. But usually it's just so comforting to lay in bed because every other alternative is so strange and unfamiliar.\n\nPeople tell me to just get out of bed, but I'm split between wanting to and not wanting to. I don't know what I'm supposed to do when not in bed. I could do what I do in bed while sitting in a chair instead. But then my neck and back hurts.\n\nI could go for walks but I'm so tired, and nobody wants to walk with me. I could go alone but then I might as well just be in bed. I don't feel like I exist when no one sees me. My life is on standby. I can just rot because no one will judge me.\n\nDon't get me wrong though. I don't want to have it like this. I want to be normal and be able to make friends and enjoy life outside of bed. I just don't understand how I'm supposed to. And everytime I try I end up feeling worse. I want to turn back and out of this lifestyle but I don't know how to.\n\nNo one helped me in the start. Now it's so much harder. But I don't feel like I can reach out for help. Everyone has it so much worse than me. I have it easy compared to most. I have reached out for some help, but I don't think they understand.\n\nWhen I have to get out of bed I get ready in the bathroom. I look very presentable. I don't look like someone who can't get out of bed for mundane tasks. Because I show up to my appointments on time, clean and groomed.\n\nI can get out of bed for the tasks I understand. I understand taking a shower and going to the bathroom. I understand \"hanging out\" the few times it happens. I understand having to be somewhere at a certain time. I understand eating when I feel hungry.\n\nBut I don't understand preparing a meal for mealtime or brushing my teeth in the morning and evening. Most of the time I forget, and other times I tell myself I'll do it the next time I get out of bed, only to forget. I don't understand self respect and getting out of bed for my own good. I only get out of bed for others. Now when I don't have others I don't know what to do\n\nMaybe I just stay in bed because I really really hate myself.\n\nI claim not to but actions speak louder than words.",

I know that it doesn’t get better. I know that it wont pass. The damage has been done. I know everyone struggles. I know everyone has felt pain. But has anyone else felt like they have wanted to die everyday for 41 years? I can’t think of a single reason why Im still here. Other than this primal instinct to keep going. Even without purpose. It’s a program written in the DNA that won’t let me die. But I will. Eventually. And all of this was for nothing. I suppose maybe I’m too stubborn to die before I do something worth living for. But I’m not programmed for that. Im not programmed for happiness. For love. For family. For friends. My internal chemical environment is just pain and heart break and loneliness and suffering. If there was something external that would fix it, Or provide relief, I would have found it. I came broken from the factory. Then had a life of hell. Now im here asking strangers if they too feel this broken. I just don’t understand why so many people get to experience love and family and a life full of complaints I would kill to have while I’m just over here by myself suffering with no one to give a shit.

I feel so so lazy. I used to be someone with ambition and drive. Now I just sit in my bed after school and on my weekends. Some days I can't even get out of bed for school.\n\nI don't want to self diagnose or anything but I think I've gone a long time with undiagnosed ADD which has caused me to spiral this past year or two because of the increased intensity and pressure in school work and struggling to get normal things done. Being in class or watching a video and barely picking up any information whilst I'm distracted and my classmates retaining that informational immediately is tiring. Knowing I want to do good and struggling to get started on small tasks because of how much energy it takes now is exhausting. And now? I'm just lazy. I wanted to get into med school and maybe if I had tried harder, it would've worked. I just received my rejection letters after interviews. I broke up with my boyfriend of a year around a month ago. To top it off, I have abusive immigrant parents. My grades aren't going to improve because I know what I'm like. It also seems as though whenever things start to improve, I always get dragged back down. I'm tired. There's no point. I'm not good enough for ANYONE.\n\nIt's even more confusing when over a year ago, I was doing okay before I started the last two years of school. I was going to the gym, in good shape, eating super good, funny and charismatic around my friends and had a great boyfriend. Then I started to get involved in arguments with my parents, getting verbally abused and screamed at in front of my face, having to run away from home. Then everything started to go downhill. Now I feel like my life is over. Although in 2021 I had gone through a similar type of episode and I think it's worse this time round.\n\nI wish there was an easy fix. I might go see my doctor finally because I just don't believe I'm depressed, my whole life I've been told others have it worse. My inability to do things makes me feel awful and is causing me to give up on everything and fantasise about suicide if only I didn't feel so bad leaving everyone behind with guilt or hatred towards me. However, I've started to feel more selfish about it. I might go through with it in April. My whole existence has been a mistake and all I do is ruminate on everything. My venting doesn't get me anywhere and I can't pull myself up and out of this horrible pit of sadness that I've gotten myself into.\n\nI just need help or an escape. I don't want to be this way, I hate it this way. ",

My parents made me do things way beyond my age like washing other's underwear at 8 or cooking when i was barely in middle school. If i refused or didn't do it well enough i got severely punished. I think these experiences traumatized me because my memories are foggy but i know lots of things like that happened. \n\nNow that my mom has a small shop, she expects me to take care of everything at home whenever i don't have classes. I have to wake up early, stay at the shop, clean and cook sometimes. Our house isnt really small so i feel like i do endless physical labor, yet it's never enough for them. Meanwhile, my siblings make a mess and throw things everywhere and i have to clean up after them constantly. They're 18 and 14. \n\nWhen i try to talk to my mom about how exhausting it is, she just dismisses me saying things like \"you think you're just going to live here for free ?\" or \"you should do that because you're always asking for money anyway \". As if i owe them something just for existing. I get that parents provide for their kids but isn't that what they chose to do by having children ? Why does she expect me to handle her responsibilities ? I already help way more than i should i think. And yet, i feel like im losing my time and my youth for nothing because i can't do anything else (they don't really let me, mostly if it requires money) and i don't even earn anything from all this. I mean we''re not even poor i can tell that we're kind of stable. \n\nThat's why im always frustrated and irritated. And when i express it suddenly im the villain because they don't understand why i feel this way. But im not just physically tired im also mentally exhausted. I can't do anything for myself. I can't even read a book without being interrupted because people come to shop at the grocery. I feel like i have no space, no freedom, nothing of my own. \n\nI’m exhausted i can't take it anymore and i feel like no one in my family even sees how much this is draining me because we kids OWE OUR LIVES TO OUR PARENTS WTF ",

If you have financial comfort, If you had a loving spouse, friends, good grades, hobbies, favourite games, a loving family — then surely you're supposed to be happy? \n\nI still feel nothing. Not quite sad but just nothing. I thought striving for a better version of myself and my life would extinguish this feeling of emptiness. I could have never imagined this life for myself years ago, you know? especially since abuse has shaped my mind at that point. \n\nI thought it was life that's the sole problem. It's me too. ",

So I’ve been taking the antidepressant Effexor for the past 6 months, a fast acting SNRI, and have noticed sustainable improvement to my overall clarity and mood. However, I did notice that there was a certain aspect of life that I was missing out on, the beauty I once saw, the light that used to shimmer. So after some independent research I decided to try the drug DXM along with my SNRI. I’ve been taking 100mg of DXM daily for the past 2 weeks, and have noticed nothing except for positive changes. I’m making this post not to promote the use of DXM for depression, but to simply give my experience in hope that it may help somebody else along the way. Love.",

    "body": "I’m 16F, and I’ve been trying to figure myself out for a while now. The more I think about it, the more I realize I don’t really care about anyone. Like, at all. I don’t even think I want to care, but I know it’s expected, so I’m trying to act the part. Not because I actually want to be more empathetic, but because I was raised by loving parents, and I want them to see me as “normal.” It just makes things easier.\n\nI’m a perfectionist, which makes everything feel like a cycle of frustration. I lose interest in things and get bored so easily. Nothing holds my attention for long unless it constantly keeps me on edge. That, combined with how I see people, makes me feel kind of disconnected from everything. I have no emotional attachment to anyone, and I’ve lost any sympathy or empathy I used to have for real people. But weirdly enough, I can still cry over fictional characters. That’s what made me start testing myself—watching disturbing things just to see if I’d feel anything. I haven’t actually done it yet, but the thought is there.\n\nI’ve self-diagnosed with dysesthesia and symptoms of BPD, which might explain a lot of the emotional numbness I feel. But I don’t talk about it with anyone. I avoid bringing up my problems because I don’t want to worry anyone—especially my family. At the same time, I feel lonely and isolated. It’s a weird contradiction—giving up on people but still wanting emotional connections.\n\nI used to skip college a lot, not because of academics (studies are ridiculously easy for me), but because I didn’t want people pitying me for being alone, lonely, and smart. My father’s reputation plays a huge role in how I conduct myself in school—he’s a well-respected person in a high position, so I’m always expected to be at the top. That part never bothered me because I actually like proving I’m smarter than most people my age. Maybe that’s narcissism, but I enjoy meeting high expectations.\n\nI’ve been sick and depressed since high school, and my parents worried about me a lot. Sometimes, I used that to my advantage—playing the sick victim card to get what I wanted. Not that I was always faking, but I knew how to use their concern. I guess I’m manipulative in that sense. But at the same time, people close to me never really care about my preferences. Conversations are always about them, never about me. My older sibling, who’s extroverted and great at connecting with people, is basically everyone’s favorite, which makes me feel inferior in comparison. I tried communicating with them, but they just aren’t the type to handle serious conversations.\n\nWhenever I talk to my parents (my dad is logical, my mom is emotional), they either over-worry or just try to rationalize everything instead of actually listening to me. Now they expect me to study non-stop for my career, even telling me to cut my sleep because they don’t think I’m serious enough. I am serious, but my mental health makes it hard to focus.\n\nAt this point, I’ve just decided to make pretending my first nature. If I can act the way people expect me to, I won’t have to deal with questions or concerns. I don’t think it’s a bad thing—it’s just a skill I need to function in society.\n\nBut sometimes, I do wonder… what’s actually wrong with me?",

I got into a beautiful and healthy relationship and we’ve been together for over a year. I recently moved out of my parent’s house (I’m 20 now btw). I also have an amazing job in a hospital doing ect (no I don’t shock people’s fucking brains). \n\nFor the past ~few~ months it’s been getting bad again, I didn’t think I’d start sh again but I failed that a couple weeks ago. I kept everything functional, I reached out when I needed it. I still go to work, take care of my cat and other household chores, as well as my relationships.\n\nI still however feel an overwhelming sense of emptiness, I don’t feel like I’m meant to be alive and I’ve had this recurring thought since I was a kid. I never understood what being a human was like, I’ve always felt misunderstood and like an alien just wasting a spot on this earth. My birth wasn’t planned, nobody knew about me for two months, kind of ironic since I also grew up as a “glass child” with copious amounts of suicidal tendencies. \n\nI don’t belong, I can’t really connect with people as I want to. I’m drowning my days off work with smoking weed, nic, drinking shit vodka while popping a few kpins. On top of all this I’ve completely lost my appetite so I always just feel ghostly. I wouldn’t say I’m actively suicidal but god I hope someday I just won’t wake up.\nThanks for listening",

I wanna bury myself in the dirt, I want to forget about everything and what I even lived for. I know it's just a girl but it hurts and I don't know where it hurts or which way it's hurting from. I guess this is just dopamine for us human beings, just so we can feel motivated and survive.\n\nI sometime put the music loud af and stared into deep sorrow night, to see if I can have some peace and quiet from my pain, as time goes by I'll probably forget about her but I wish I was the one.

I wish I was something special so I can grab her attention and feel happy. \n\nWhy do I have deep desire for someone who don't even know I exist? \n\nWhy do I feel so much sorrow and pain for someone who won't even look my way?\n\nShould I be a fool, so she'll look my way for a split sec? Will I be happy?\n\nDeep sorrows cut like sharp knives. \n\nI rather be heart broken knowing I was with her and it did not work out rather then to be delusional and make up fantasy about being with her.\n\nI tried to keep my composure whenever I see her talk to men. I gotta be strong.\n\nWell, I guess it was a privilege to be born in the same era as her. \n\nSorry about the vent, I'll try to go sleep now, I don't want to look like a pop-eyed goldfish.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I was living with my mother for a while but my stepfather was abusing me so I started living with my grandparents instead. My father is still supporting me financially and I feel really bad about it. I was depressed and I feel like I'm getting better that's why I'm feeling bad for not working. I'm currently going to a technical school and I'm studying because I want to go to university instead. I need therapy but I can't afford it (I was waiting for about six months for free one and I'm still waiting.) My parents know about my problems but they are telling me that I should just get over everything because it was in the past which I understand because I'm an adult and I'm responsible for myself right now. I'm giving most of the money that my father is giving me to my grandparents because I'm living with them and it's a resasenoble thing to do. I'm just really scared of working and I'm overwhelmed by everything. I'm trying to pretend that I'm fine because no one cares and I know that I should get my shit together but all of it is too much for me. A year ago I was laying on my bed unable to move and now I'm leaving the house everyday, cooking, cleaning, studying, going to the dentist, exercising and just doing the basic stuff but I feel like it's killing me. After the whole day I'm extremely tired and unable to move. I feel like crying myself to sleep but I'm smoking instead because I don't want to fall apart. I just feel like a terrible person who is just extremely lazy. I feel privileged because I'm still getting money from my father and I feel like a parasite.

I wish I didn’t care at all, but I do to an unhealthy extent. The fact that ugliness is still socially acceptable to mock just makes this nightmare feeling even more real. It’s crazy how, even in my own friend group, the tallest guy is the most respected and happiest, while the shortest has the most problems in his life. I mean, I can’t count how many times the jokes write themselves.\n\nI know I'm overly sensitive, and posting about my problems online probably isn’t the best idea, but what other options do I have? Mindfulness, SSRIs, and CBT didn't help at all. How happy can you really be when you know you're not separate from nature and your chances of experiencing 'love' are determined by things entirely outside of your control?\n\nThe only thing that actually makes a difference is socializing with people I feel close to. But no matter how hard I try, I can't seem to move past the acquaintance phase now. All my old friends moved on to different colleges, and now I spend my time online and alone, struggling to care about my future, knowing it's just going to get worse with age.\n\nWhat can I do to not feel 'bad'?

There’s barely enough food in the house to last a week at all times. I love animals and wanted to be a vet but whats the point I’ll just be in more debt then I already am an be depressed about how poorly people treat there animals. I’m dating someone but it’s not going anywhere because again I can’t feel loved.

I was recently hospitalized with 7 stomach ulcers and I am through intense mental and physical health struggles. I’m in therapy twice a week and on medication, but things keep getting worse.\n\nMy single mom had to take on over $100k of debt to keep me in school, and she doesn’t have a job. I’m terrified for us financially. We’ve always struggled, but it feels like everything is collapsing this year.\n\nI’ve also been involved in a traumatic family lawsuit since I was 8 years old, and over the past year I’ve had to take an active role in it. I’m still waiting on a judgment related to finances that we were depending on, and I’ve heard nothing. Because of the case, my grandfather suddenly stopped talking to me and cut me off emotionally and financially.\n\nThe stress has caused my mom and I to fight so much she’s lovely but so stressed herself. To make things worse, my younger brother hasn’t spoken to me in over a year since I came out to him as gay. He was the one person I thought understood me — now I feel like I’ve lost him too. I feel like I can’t go home to take time off of school because it will lead to so much fighting with how my mental health is. I’m not rlly able to do anything at all.\n\nI quit my dance team, distanced from friends, and feel like I’ve withdrawn from everything. Even my previously happy and healthy relationship is struggling now due to all this stress.\n\nMy dad left when I was 8 and has never spoken to me since. My family feels broken, and I feel completely alone in the world.\n\nI know I’m doing what I can — therapy, medication — but nothing seems to touch the pain of losing family, financial safety, or the legal stress.

We tried out many things together & lives have been better because we are meeting more meaningful people. However, we never truly make any more friends whom we could hang out with, it’s always just a ‘waving & hi’ with them.

I want to go to a party at 12a & have fun but she wants to go to bed. I know why she don't want to go. Because every time she went out in a frat, we just like, just two of us dancing together. And it's so hard to talk to people in a frat, especially when you don't know them beforehand. They're sticking to their own friend groups. It's not like you can make friends with strangers. We've been to many frat parties, but it's not working out. That's why we stepped back a little and she lost hope with it.

I have no one else I could go with, so I have to stay at home, I am so upset because everyone else was screaming & happy & enjoying the party outside I could hear the noise, and Im in my bed miserable wanting to go but I cant because my only friend doesnt want to.

    "body": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m a 20-year-old guy, still living with my parents and my little sister.\n\nMy mom doesn’t work anymore; she’s always at home. She has mental health issues, like thinking everyone is out to get her.\n\nTo explain what kind of relationship I have with her: in the past, I fell into depression. We went to a psychiatrist, who prescribed me antidepressants. But she wasn’t satisfied with my diagnosis. She desperately wanted me to have bipolar disorder, even though I clearly didn’t. She took me to several other psychiatrists, lying about me so they would prescribe neuroleptics. She even tried to convince me that I was bipolar.\n\nThen, she tried to convince everyone else that I was crazy and had anger issues, even though I obviously didn’t. She told people that if she was sick, it was only because of me. She even told them she was scared I was going to kill her in her sleep. My sisters took her side, and my dad didn’t care. When I talked to him, he just said, “But your mom is sick, you’re always messing with her, it’s your fault.” Even though I was just minding my own business in my room.\n\nWhen she got tired of me, she would send me to the psychiatric hospital. We kept going until we ended up back at the first psychiatrist, who told her that being “sick of me” wasn’t a good enough reason to admit me to a hospital.\n\nShe was also an alcoholic when I was a kid.\n\nNow you see what kind of mother she is. (My dad is no better.)\n\nThey always hated me. When I say that to my close friends, they always tell me, “Nooo, they don’t really hate you, they’re your parents.” But please believe me when I say they really do hate me for NO reason.\n\nI’ve always been calm, introverted, and tried my best to please people.\n\nNow, here’s what just happened, and it scares me.\n\nFirst, you should know that I’m in student debt because they paid for my sister’s school but refused to pay for mine.\n\nI stopped talking to my mom for a week because she wanted me to organize her medication. I said okay. It took two hours. And at the end, instead of thanking me, she looked at me with disgust and said, “Pff, I’m sure you hid Xanax in your pockets,” as if I were a drug addict. So I told her to apologize, or I would stop talking to her. She still didn’t.\n\nThis afternoon, I was just making an apple pie in the kitchen. I thought people would be happy about it, lol.\n\nWhile I was doing it, she said stuff like, “Pff, I’m sure he’s doing it just to piss me off,” because usually, I’m not allowed to stay in the same room as her for too long, or she sees it as provocation.\n\nThen, she suddenly stormed into the kitchen, crying and yelling because I added more dishes to the sink (even though I was going to wash them). She completely lost it, screaming that I was “doing everything I could to ruin their lives,” that “they couldn’t stand me anymore,” etc.\n\nMy apple pie needed ten more minutes in the oven, but she started shouting, “NO, I CAN’T WAIT TEN MORE MINUTES WITH YOU HERE! LEAVE THE ROOM!!!” I wasn’t even talking, just washing the dishes.\n\nThen my dad told me I was making them crazy. I told him I was just minding my own business, and he said, “Maybe that’s the problem.” And he said to back up my bags and that by tomorrow I should not be in the house anymore \n\nGuys, whatever I do, they always have something to say. They just want me gone. He said they were going to kick me out. It reminded me of when my mom tried everything to send me to a hospital when I was too young to be kicked out.\n\n⸻\n\nNow, I know they really will kick me out.\n\nI don’t know what to do. I have 6€ in my bank account. I’m in debt, and my studies take a lot of time. I tried to find a weekend job because I knew my situation at home was unstable, but I couldn’t find one. I’m so scared.\n\nI also don’t have any friends that could help me. And I don’t have family because my mom fought with her entire family, so we haven’t spoken to them in years and years.\n\nWhat do you recommend I do?\n\nYou might say I should work, and yes, I should probably keep looking for a job. But if I only work weekends, will I make enough to afford rent, food, and my 300€/month debt payments I'll have to start paying very soon?\n\nThe big problem is that I’m in med school, and my studies will last for a long time. I think I’ll get a (low) salary in my 6th year, but right now, I’m only in my 2nd year.\n\n(Side note: I haven’t had a proper meal in more than a week because they don’t make food for me and won’t let me cook. I’ve just been eating garbage—cookies, snacks, whatever I can find. At school, I can’t eat lunch because I don’t have enough money in my bank account.)\n\nI’m lost and scared.",

People being such unkind, uncaring, self-centered beings they've always been.\n\nI'm tired of not even being able to get out of bed most days. Of course I always end up getting out of bed, but not without a massive struggle to do so.\n\nI'm tired of being in constant mental distress. I've had anxiety my whole life, pretty much ruining most of my childhood and teen years. It got so bad at one point, I was basically in a perpetual, never ending anxiety attack for about two years straight. The anxiety improved, but depression got worse. And now I'm facing bad depression.\n\nI'm tired of everything being such a struggle. Just one thing right after the other. And it never stops. It's always *something.*\n\nI'm tired of feeling like I'm just dragging my rotting corpse wherever my brain thinks it needs to be. I'm tired of not feeling truly alive, but just merely existing.\n\nI'm tired of not really finding joy in most things. Of course, I enjoy my hobbies, but when I do I feel it's mostly half-hearted enjoyment at best.\n\nI hope you see why I'm tired.",

I’m also not sure if what I’m facing is depression. \n\n\n\nI don’t know what I feel but my life is not the same barely any excitement but IK I’m not going to kill myself but I can’t explain it.\n\nMy Weekdays are usually like:\n\nMy mom waking me up but me just refusing till the last minute.\n\nGetting dressed quick not caring much about how I look and just sighing while looking at myself in the mirror.\n\nQuickly eating breakfast but I have many anger outburst in the morning uncontrolled I shout over small stuff.\n\nIn the car it’s usually me not speaking because my parents and sister are angry I am almost making them late again and I shout sometimes again.\n\nSchool just drags on I barely have anyone to talk to or any time to do so as we have assigned seats and strict teachers but I do talk some classes but I feel like crying sometimes from loneliness.\n\nOn my A day I usually have to eat lunch with my friend which is a whole another building so I have to walk all the way there but then I also have to see her say bye to my ex friend there who hurt me by leaving me with no explanation and it hurts seeing her with her but I just shrug it off.\n\nBut for the past month or two I have been staying in my building to eat lunch alone away from her because I want to be alone idk why.\n\nThen on my B days I eat lunch alone and I find it peaceful but it hurts seeing other ppl eat lunch with friends I could sit with other people and talk to them but I don’t know I just can’t bring myself to do it because I feel like I can finally rest.\n\nI sometimes think back to last year when everything was good when I felt better but I did stupid stuff I regret back then to but I didn’t have this feeling and actually put in an effort for appearance and interactions with my friends didn’t feel so forced. \n\nI still think back cry and regret what I did I went on omgel slowly got groomed slowly finally gave in sent nudes which I still regret I feel disgusted with myself. I still remember a sleepover and me and my friends uploading a snap story and my friend getting a text and him just compliment me and that I’m pretty IDK all of this felt good as I was getting validation that I felt better about myself because my mom body shamed me IG.\n\nI also remember texting a guy at night he was my age and online I met him on my alt account and IG we texted every night for a few days before my mom caught me I got grounded and they took my phone away for a few days but I was ok I had my iPad.\n\nThat guy was sweet but I stopped texting him and then my friends added me to this gc a bunch of bullying ig but not directed to me but I still defended stuff my dad saw it again and Ig that’s when I ended my stupid online stuff and actually for the first time cleared my phone and didn’t do stuff that needed to be secretive on it.\n\nI did more stuff online that might have hurt me but that was vague details ig but not to much I never showed my face and took measures but IG it somehow affected me.\n\nThen summer started I just stayed home and watched something all day on my screen and went out with my parents I was still ok but I did gain weight. I also lost the spark with my friends ig.\n\nThen the school year started though it would be the best but I was wrong and then on A days I used to sit with new people but had to leave to discuss with my friend because this friend left me and I lost those other people.\n\nAnd then everything just happened if felt like it repeated every day.\n\nI still wanted to look good tho and I went to school and procrastinated at home and did my work late slept late and then my health obviously isn’t going to be great and my mom would be worried and I know she cares for me but she has been diagnosed with depression so IG that makes it worse for her and me and everyone in the house.\n\nIt’s just a lot of shouts and screams some days or should I say recently most of the days they are directed towards me and she swears calls me names and I try not to shout back cause if I do at that time it only ends with something idk what it is but she falls down screams cries and say I’m going to kill my self I don’t know but I barely cry infront of them and just look ig.\n\nThis hurts I wish I can improve myself make my mom happy then none of this would happen my mom and my family would be much happier but my mom is suicidal and she asks me if she should leave if she should kill her self because I seemingly shout at her which I’m not proud of.\n\nWhat makes me feel guilt just a tiny but is when I go to my friends house and they open and omgele alt and somehow I end up being praised IK those me are sick but it gives me validation however I don’t do it on my own at home I know infront of my friends I wouldn’t be able to do something stupid.\n\nI constantly compare myself to friends and other I have so much in my life I should be happy I really should but I don’t which hurts I feel lower then everyone I just want to cry the whole day but I don’t.\n\nI even stay in the room during weekend pretending I’m doing work while I’m on my phone as I don’t know why but I just don’t want to spend time with anyone while the whole week I have done nothing but that. This also causes conflict my mom shouts at me which I just hate again. I feel like dying at that movement just for me to end up in hell from all the pain I caused others around me. \n\nNot even all of this matters my grandma she came here to see me but I could get myself to be of my phone as it’s my escape it drowns my memories away all the pain but why do I have it don’t I have a better life then the homeless. I didn’t talk much to her but she deserves my words but I didn’t I feel guilt cause she came here on a plane to see us but she left now.\n \nMy other grandma however doesn’t care much about me Ik she somehow hurt my mom a lot cause my moms depression is caused by her and still fights between my parents would be caused by her or me but what hurts is she tell us to make a pancake for ourselves with the batter she left and she pretends she can’t operate to stove and called me every single time but for her daughters children she does a lot it evident she doesn’t like us much but still.\n\nHell me even being born I made a mistake I was the last grandchild for her and I was to born girl rather then a boy like everyone wished for.\n\nLastly I don’t know what made my life like this but today also makes me question things I used to love going out and going to restaurants but now today while my mom was waking me up I didn’t want to go it may not sound large but this has been happening for a few weeks it’s not normal for me all I wanted was to stay at home a read a story of another person a fictional character with a better life.\n\nI wonder what would have happened if we stayed back in that country 2 years ago instead of moving to USA where in that place I could have grown and also done better in basket ball and actually play it more but I know that if I were to stay there I would have made a mistake.\n\nI would have gotten myself a bf I would have been reckless because of the people around me I would have hid it from my parents but I can’t help but think that would have been better my parents would have been happier and I would have been popular still and I would have still been happy and all this is because we had to move because my sister wanted to study here.\n\nI actually was in the USA since I was born just moved there for a bit.\n\nI can’t talk to my sis she tell everything to my mom and I don’t want to ask anyone for academic help cause she makes me feel dumb. I know she is also just trying to help me but it hurts the way she talks. She makes me mad from just existing probably because I’m jealous? She is older than me to.\n\nWhat worries me is will I ever make an attempt to change my life what would motivate me to make a change when I feel it not so worth it.\n\n\nIf you can answer these question I would feel happy:\n\nI’m just confused why do I want to not talk?Why do I not want to spend time with my friends why do I feel fake around them?\nWhy do I have to have everyone hate me?\nWhy am I letting my grades drop?\nWhy am I letting life be bad when I can get it in control and make it better?\nWhy do I feel it would be easier to end my life?\nBut what is stopping me why am I not ending it?\n\n\nIf anyone is reading this and read such a big rant thank you so much please leave a comment it may help and if you want to talk you could just DM me it’s better to struggle together then alone ig make motivate each other.",

They took my life, and it hurt me more than anything in my life, I try no to think of it, when I do it’s too much, the pain, they made me feel like theirs something wrong with me, I still do, it’ll never go away, they said im dangerous, that I’m a bad person, that I would come to their house and hurt them, that’ll never go away, to be labeled that way, when I think about it, it hurts so much it overwhelms me, I don’t want to feel that anymore, I’m scared to kill myself and haven’t been able to but I want to so badly it’s all I think about I want to leave and not be here anymore where people hurt me and are mean to me, I try to be kind towards others, I don’t understand why this happened to me, I want my life back but i can’t ever go back, I want to kill myself, I want to try, I want to drink enough alcohol thay I can’t feel anything and I can go all the way I’ve thought about it all month I’ve lost everything I had I was so happy I can’t do this anymore it’s too much now, I don’t know what to do, I can’t do this anymore, I feel so alone",

But ever since finding out that my younger brother (21 M) struggles as well and wants to kill himself (and apparently attempted to last year), I feel like I'm drawing a blank about how to actually help him. \n\nI know the fact that he's seeking help is good. He's seeing a therapist weekly and started Prozac about a month ago. I go to the gym with him about 3 times a week and he seems happy then. But he still seems so bad overall. He barely showers and his moods fluctuate quite a bit. He feels like his friends don't actually like him. And there's a ton he doesn't tell me and I don't want to be an annoying, prying older sister. I've tried so many times to tell him I don't judge, I know what it's like to want to die, and I love him and just want him to be happy, but I know he's still embarrassed to open up. My mom really tries her best to talk to him, too. Every once in a while he'll open up but mostly he just gets annoyed. \n\nHe's been sleeping most of the past 24 hours and I'm freaking out. I don't know what else to do, but there's no way I'm giving up. The thought of him killing himself makes me sick.\n\nAm I justified in feeling so scared? Is there more I could be doing? Or things I should be doing differently?",

I don't want to view another philosophical view or some bs about nihilism.\n\nI have been dealing with a sudden Existential Crisis since last Thursday 3/13/25. This is honestly ironic as it was the day after my 15th birthday. I didn't have anything major life-changing like a breakup or whatever, but I was just suddenly questioning reality. I've had these questions like 'what is the point of life', or 'who is real', since I was very young, but I was always able to shake them off. But this time I got very invested and researched, and eventually it was to the point I was having a panic attack. I slept and the day after felt horrible. I had 0 interest in the present and just kept thinking about existence and meaning. However, over the week, I talked with GPT like a therapist (I can't afford one) and it has gotten better. I learned that what I was mostly feeling was derealization. I do feel better a week later, I don't question the abstract part as much but I'm feeling something else. This is what I wanted to ask:\n\nAlthough I wasn't as stressed as before about existence, I just feel empty- especially when I'm alone. I don't feel much motivation, and it feels like I'm looking out a glass window as life goes on. I hate this. I don't want to spend the rest of my life dealing with this. I wished I had never had that one thought. I normally had very strong emotions. I just almost feel depressed. I often get scared for it to turn dark because that is when I start getting anxious or depressed. \n\nIf you guys had something similar, please share how you overcame it. Does it just come and go? And please, if you have something negative to say, I really don't want to think about it.",

    "body": "I went to therapy for a little more than a year. It did help me get perspective on the things I was struggling with, and I grew more and more confident and stable with how I handle myself during my depressive episodes. I saw how I could convince myself that setbacks happen but it doesn't mean you're not progressing, it doesn't mean you'll forever be depressed. I used to say this as a temporary spell to break me out of an episode, but after a while I really believed in it. I did things that I would have never done and it actually brought me joy. So I decided to stop and \"graduate\" from therapy 2 months ago (as my therapist said lol). \n\nI've had 2 meltdowns that lasted for 3-4 days since I stopped. The bigger one was the recent one where I got so anxious about deciding on my future career path that I got a panic attack and got stuck in an episode for 3 days. I know this is related to anxiety, but everytime this happens I revert back to how I lived when I was abroad and depressed alone. I cant eat much, cant bring myself to shower, I have to fake being able to talk to people and space out the whole day. I feel useless and unworthy, I wasted every day feeling guilty of being useless, and then I feel guilty for wasting time. I have zero confidence in myself, I've been living my life based on other people's opinions and advices and I've been through a lot of bad times when I made the decision.\n\nI dont have my own space to fully process all the emotions and thoughts, and I dont like asking/talking to my friends and family because i feel like they dont really understand what I'm going through (only one friend had depression but she was also the cause of mine so sometimes I don't feel comfortable talking about it with her) so the feelings got worse and made me think of su**ide.\n\nI'm feeling a little better now but I know that when I have an episode again, the same dread will arise and I just really hate how much it affects me. I'm not sure if it's necessary to continue seeing a therapist or do I just need to develop healthy coping mechanisms?\n",

I just spiraled, I think it was a mix of coming from a funeral yesterday, the pain, and being stressed from the rushing and an exam I have later that I just started self harming. When they caught me it only just made it worse, my mother was screaming what was wrong with me and asking why, \"how do you think you doing this makes me feel\" I just felt even more miserable and awful.

    "body": "\nBeen dealing with depression for like 8 yrs now and funny enough I started smoking around the same time I got diagnosed. For me, smoking’s always been an escape, just something to fill the void. At least it gives me that temporary chill, even if it’s all in my head. Can’t say the same for antidepressants tho. Those just slowed me down, made me gain weight, and honestly made shit worse.\n\nSince this depressive episode been dragging on for years, feels like my brain’s fried. My mind’s always foggy, memory’s trash, and sometimes even forming a sentence feels like a damn struggle. I know depression itself can do that, but could smoking be making it worse? I read somewhere that it messes with o2 flow to the brain, weakens neurons, and slows down thinking, but no clue if that’s real or just more bs theories.\n\nTbh when it comes to mental health, I lost faith in docs and all that traditional treatment shit. My experience with antidepressants was a disaster, and at this point, I trust real ppl’s experiences way more than whatever new study they push every few months.\n\nSo how true is it that smoking actually makes depression symptoms worse, like brain fog and focus issues? Cuz if that’s legit, I might need to rethink some things. My life’s already a mess thanks to this busted brain, and I just wanna fix whatever I still can. Maybe someone else can get something outta this too.\n\n",

I know you also want to tell me that I should seek professional help and get back to taking medication. But keeping up with appointments started to get really daunting for me and I don't see myself going back into it anytime soon. As for medication there are numerous reasons why i stopped taking it. 1. I cannot afford it. It gave me relief but then my parents stopped offering to pay for it for me, im only 19 so please dont give me a hard time on this. 2. i dont think medication will ever change my interpretation of others and it makes me irritated if it does change my views on other people. This is because I have grown this hatred over time for those who think i should be a certain way and took my true happiness. This applies to my friends, family and strangers who cant frind the most basic fucking human decency to give a little respect. But growing up in a selfish world isnt going to end well for me and I'll tell you that I don't see myself enduring through it. I'm NOT WEAK MINDED people get this upfront view of me that im overreactive. I'm also autistic so if you have it yourself or you've done research on it you'd realise this makes your emotions 100000000x fucking worse to put up with. ON TOP of society standards where I can't be seen any other way or i'll be miserably lonely forever. Never have I ever complained about solitude but it only started to bother me because others couldn't grasp the fact I LIKED BEING ALONE. But yeah I just have to keep taking it up the ass just like everybody else because thats the type of world we live in. We can't help eachother or ourselves, we put ourselves first and thats good but people cant seem to understand that they cant take this to extremes or everyone else suffers around them. But yeah, I'm just done with putting in any effort or being any use to anyone, so I guess people can just walk over me, i think i give up. ",

    "body": "this is my first post so sorry if it's all over the place!\n\ni'm 15 years old and have been struggling mentally for about a year and a half. it started freshman year when i started to skip school a lot, and i been a lot like at least once a week. i would skip school for many reasons like because i had sleeping problems. i'd had sleeping problems since 7th grade and could sleep without some kind of sleeping medicine. another reason i would skip is because i just simply didn't have the engergy. i didn't have the energy to get up in the morning then i didn't have enough to get up at all and i would bed rot for days. another reason is because i have a lot going on in my head i often think back into my childhood which wasn't good with my parents being split up and being abused in almost every way. i ended up failing algebra and had to take it again this year. which makes me feel stupid because i didn't fail because i'm dumb i failed because i never went to school and did my work. i'm also extremely shy and anxious so when i would go back to school and class that i missed a bunch of i would get worked up and have panic attacks. On top of that i only have like 3 friends maybe. i've never been social or good at making friends (i've been friends with all of them since i was a kid). at the beginning of second semester of freshman year i had to talk to a probation officer about my absences and was almost put on probation, but i kept missing school. even after being threatened with probation, cps, and juvie i continued to skip. I HATE SCHOOL AND ANYTHING ABOUT IT. when sophomore year started last fall it started good. i was somewhat happy with my classes and wasn't skipping a lot. my school has a rule that if you miss 4 or less days you don't have to take finals and every semester i strived to miss less the 4 days but of school that never happened until last fall i had miss 4 days so i could miss anymore and one day in november i skipped again. then it all started again i started skipping a lot again and my grades slipped and when school ended my mom signed me up for online school. i started doing online school in january but never really did it (idk why i just couldn't). and eventually i was kicked out of online and for the past month i haven't gone to school at all and i've just been laying in my room feeling depressed. i've fucked myself for life with what i've done to myself. i'll probably never be able to come back from this academically or mentally and honestly feel like there no reason for me to go on. if i can't even go to school or do my work then i'll never be able to have a job or work. my whole life i've felt like somethings wrong with me. when i was little my dad loved my stepmom or than me i felt unlovable and developed self esteem issues at a very young age. i've always felt ugly and boys never have really showed interest in me, rather people around me. i also feel dumb from failing classes but because all my friends are very smart (my best friend is top of the class) so i have always felt pressured. also i have 2 cousin that are in my grade who do really well academically and athletically so my grandma i live with is always comparing me to them. i used to be so happy and do well in school and i even played sports. i played softball for 8 years but eventually my mental health got in the way of that as well. mental illnesses run in my family and so does addiction so i've been doomed since before i was born. i've suspected that  im mentally ill for a while (since i've always felt like something's wrong with me) and i think i might have depression. i sit in my room all day by myself, because that's the only way i'm happy. i'm only happy when i'm alone or so that's what i thought but i'm starting to think that's just what i'm used to and i've just adapted to that feeling and think its happiness. (i hope that makes sense). But truly the only way i'm happy is when i'm high and i'm not trying to sound like a pothead, but i've been smoking since i was 13 so it's became a coping mechanism i guess. also weed is the only thing that helps me sleep so when i did go to school i would have to get violently hugh ever night just to be able to sleep. i tried to start self harming when i was 12 but could never bring myself to cut myself, making me feel like a pussy. when i was 14 is when i actually started self harming. i would burn myself with cigarettes and still do it to this day. almost 2 years later and nobody has ever noticed. NOT A SINGLE SOUL HAS NOTICED SCARS OF MY ARMS AND LEGS. i'm starting to think i should burn myself in more noticeable places so people will notice and actually believe that i'm struggling and not a lazy failure. a call of help i guess but i don't want to seem like an attention seeker. and i think i might be starting to get addicted to it because i like the way it feels and the scars. since i've been out of school in december i've started eating less because i don't eat lunch at school anymore. i don't eat breakfast or lunch and hardly ever eat dinner. i usually just eat a snack once or twice a day or sometimes nothing at all. i've actually lost over 10 pounds because of this and i weight about 80 something pounds now and the bmi says i'm underweight. like i said earlier i struggle with self esteem issues so i don't like that way i look. i've been extremely skinny my whole life and was often praised for it as a kid, so now it's nailed in my head i have to been skinny and petite. when i was a little kid i was short, skinny, blonde, blue eyed, and had a perfect smile thanks to my fake teeth. i'm starting to think i might be anorexic or am developing it because on top of loosing that weight i have also lost my appetite and often have to force myself to eat. my period have became irregular and almost didn't have one last month, which i know happens when someone is anorexic. i spend a lot of time in the mirror looking at myself, and i hate how i look. thin lips, dead dyed hair, dark circles, bad skin, crooked teeth, everything. i also spend alot of time looking at my body. i hate how flat i am but also love being skinny. i know this isn't nice but i'm scared to become fat and often see myself bigger then i am. i only feel skinny when i can see my ribs poking through my skin, but i hate how skinny my legs and arms are. i find myself caking on tons of makeup just to feel a bit pretty. i hate my smile because my teeth are crooked. as i little kid i had to get caps on my real teeth because they were rotting or something. my teeth were perfectly straight and SO WHITE, but now are just crooked and yellowish. i haven't been to the dentist in 8 or 9 years and i have cavities i think. when i was a kid my dad enjoyed pulling my teeth out for some weird reason so as i got older i stopped talking about my teeth period with anyone and i didn't even touch my loose teeth. i would let them fall out on their of or wait for the new tooth the grow above it, creating crowding with my teeth. now i'm almost 16 and haven't even lost all my teeth yet. \n\ni've tried talking to people but nobody understands me. i've never met anyone who's gone through the same things as me. none of friends growing up and now didn't have split parents, none of them were abused, or lived in a dysfunctional household. not even my parents or siblings understand cause they didn't go through it. anytime i try and talk about how i'm feeling to my mom or grandma they just bring up school and remind me that i'm a failure. i've been asking to go to the doctor for over a year and they say they'll take me but they never do, no matter how much i've cried,begged, and pleaded...literally. i have broke down in tear multiple times just begging for help and nobody does anything. Nobody has really ever asked me what's wrong or something like that. not friends. not teachers. not even my family. i feel so lost and different from everyone else and i just want help. im actually starting to blame my mom for that way i am. because if she just took me to the doctors like she promised i probably wouldn't be writing this right now. i don't know what to do anymore help or a doctor is not and option anymore and i can't talk to anyone. i tried to kill myself last year but absolutely it didn't work and i've been contemplating suicide again for a while now. i'm never gonna be anything or do anything in life so i feel like there's no point. everyday i live just feels like a chore at this point and i'm tired of vacuuming the same spot everyday if you know what i mean.\n\nso i guess i'm coming to reddit or help or answers. if you have questions i'd be happy to answer them. i honestly have no idea what to do with myself.

    "body": "That's all. I just want to be nice to people and cause a good impression, but my anxiety gets in the way. I know what I have to do, but I'm simply unable to be myself. My brain just can't be normal around others and it saddens me. There are days where I can connect freely with others, but most of the time I just act zombie-like and come off as uninterested. I currently work a very boring, bureaucratic government job but I'm studying for what is equivalent to the SATs in my country to try to get into medicine. If I am unable to make any significant impact on the life of others through my personality, then maybe I can get into a field where I can do that through other means. This, in my eyes, would be a way to save myself from a miserable, unimpactful middle age...\n\nI like people. I like living. And I try my best every day. But I just wish it was easier for me. I go to therapy and it makes me feel better, but it can't fundamentally change who I've always been. I'm lost.",

    "body": "The poor guy has been having trouble keeping up with me because my original therapist, who was great with me, passed away suddenly and I walked in with a lot. I was in the middle of going through a lot of psychological changes with the first therapist and all of a sudden this guy had to be thrust into it. To his credit, he has kept his cool so far even though I didn't trust him at first. My psychiatrist says I'm improving but the only role a psychiatrist really plays is medicine management so it's all a matter of are the meds working or not. Thankfully they are which is why I'm only posting and talking about it and often instead of acting out impulsively and destroying things like I used to in high school. I think one of my main problems right now is that I'm readjusting to being completely sober instead of just California sober. The pain I've been going through is just searing hot, unlike My peers who can go out and have a drink or smoke a joint and turn those feelings off, I don't get that luxury. Whatever I feel stays there until it's over and I don't see an end in sight. Sometimes it feels like I want to die. I don't want to die but I have grown tired of this weight on my heart. The constant worrying if someone is okay. I've been met with a lot of criticism for speaking out and being honest and I'm honestly to the point where I don't care and I get combative because this is what I was trying to do. I was trained to talk It out. There's just one big problem though. I don't trust the immediate people around me because of all the criticism I've gotten so I've been posting on Reddit about it. I know it's sad but in between therapy, this is the only place I feel safe. If somebody says something I don't like I can just block them and I never have to hear it again. I don't mean to be an inconvenience to anybody but at some point I had to put at least a little bit of my training from therapy into action or else what was the point? I don't know. Sometimes I feel like I'm just a burden on everybody and maybe I would be better off dead but I can't do that to my family so I suffer. I don't feel like anybody understands me. My therapist barely understands me as hard as he tries. I'm not a very religious guy but I've even taken to praying at the cemetery and it's one of the few times I actually do get a little bit of peace in my troubled mind. Something about the quiet air and being able to look up at the stars next to my dad's grave is somehow soothing. I guess the best way I can put this is that I am okay but I'm not okay. I don't know if I'm spiraling or falling with style. The only thing I do know is that I didn't slip, I jumped.",

I have been feeling very lonely and super depressed and just need a place to vent. \n\nI came to the US for my master's with a goal to study and finally get a job while also experiencing a new life. It's been 3.5 years since I have been here and I haven't been able to do any of that. I completed my master's but couldn't land an internship or a job. I was basically alone during my master's, couldn't make any friends. All I could do is see people around me enjoying their lives, finding jobs, travelling, falling in love and overall having a good time, and I ended up short of all those things after trying so hard. I genuinely did. Now all the people that I knew around me have moved away from me and I don't really have anyone to talk to and I still stuck here trying to find a job, no money, make friends and get better. I had a couple of \"friends\" from my home country but no one really messages me or talks to me unless I reach out and that feels really shitty. I see everyone moving ahead in life and making something for themselves and then see myself still stuck where I was before it all began and I feel like I am reaching my breaking point now. I have been constantly contemplating about ending things and I can't just get that out of my head..

    "body": "because of online friends, my life almost got ruined.\n\nduring my elementary and middle school life, i got bullied. I’ve always had online friends during this time but it wasn’t that bad (until 2020 but some of the parts in here are relevant to this story) so it was maybe December 2023 and I lost my last friends in my school(I went to a small school so the only ones left were the popular kids who bullied me) I was 13 during this time and I made some close online girl friends and one guy friend. \n\nthen during February 2024, those friends didn’t really contact me as much and I was getting bored since a new girl came to my class during January but then suddenly stopped being my friend. so anyways, I use to play Fortnite but i didn’t really like the game but heard you can find friends there so I decided to do that. I made a new account(forever thankful for) and started asking people in comment sections to add. since I was obviously a girl I thought only girls would wanna play with me but nope..\n\nso anyways, some guys dmed me and I was a little skeptical. the first guy I’ll call him mark. \nmark was kinda weird, like I tried to get to know him better as a friend but he was kinda dismissive and was..strange. \n\nbasically, while we played I chatted to him and asked questions like, “what’s ur favourite animal?” he said dog and I said cat. but then I asked him “do you wanna ask me a question” and he was like “idk” (his favourite word) so then his friend came to play with us. after that game he told me that his friend said me and mark were good together(only knew the guy for like 2 days)\n\nlater on, the guy kept ignoring me and I was getting confused. I didn’t wanna be friends with someone who wasted my time. I decided to confront him with the help of another guy(James who is the chillest guy) and to wonder why he kept ignoring me. Now btw James wasn’t that into the convo and I was talking to him in another chat but later he left since it was to much for him. al of a sudden mark just said he wants to be with me and I was so scared of saying no since he was low-key guilt tripping me. \n\nI decided to say yes even tho I had no feelings and didn’t even know who the guy was. the relationship was weird as he seemed he just wanted to ruin my life? anyways during this time I went back to my old friend group from December(Kay, Mia, nana and Joan) and they were really invested in this. they kept telling me to act up more around mark since they thought he was funny. I faked saying I was depressed and stuff to make mark break up with me since I told my December friend group I hated mark. \n\n\nlater on, another guy dmed me and asked to play. we did and eventually that was it. I’m gonna call him Donald as this guy was so weird. so after we played we stopped talking until basically, Kay told me to find another guy to “date” but I didn’t tell them I wasn’t into online dating. she said give it a try because she already had an online boyfriend. \n\nanyways, i decided to share videos to guys in my dms to try and “talk” to them but I just sent them weird videos which that part I didn’t tell Kay. anyways later on me and Donald started talking again and I thought he was actually cool and hoped I could befriend him. but nope he had a crush on me and it was obvious.\n\nso basically while I talked to him, I was bored and decided to vc him. he seemed he didn’t care and sounded like a child lmao. anyways my December friend group was listening into the call with another device as everything was good. \n\nI also made friends with another guy called Dj who I didn’t care about but accidentally treated him like a therapist(this part is importent) because I was going insane. boys were liking me and mark btw kept asking me to show my face and it was so annoying. I felt disgusted but my friends in December just thought it was funny to trick 12-14 year old boys. (they were like 15/16-18)\n\nanyways, a weird conversation with Donald made me hate him and basically. So this part made me think like “oh he’s a nice guy” because he told me his sister got her period recently and he felt scared and bad because she was in a lot of pain. I decided to be nice and say some stuff and he accepted it. it was until this part which I made sure to fake argue with guy friends to let them know I see them as a brother.\n\nso basically, he randomly called me “flat” and I was so confused so I said like “oh how do you know” no idea why I said that but then he said this “because my sister has bigger ones then you” I was shocked and disgusted and I asked him like “wdym” he then said like his sister was like c cup(she’s 11) and I was like “oh” and he said that his sister will have a Z cup when shes 18. that made me hate him because why would you say that about your sister? \n\ndays went on and suddenly Mark was being a a hole to me. he kept being bipolar or something by saying stuff like “oh I hate you” and kept ignoring me. then suddenly when we were arguing, he sent a pic of a random girl. I was shocked and I found out he could be cheating(even tho I won’t call that as a relationship) so anyways I told Donald about this as he said like “oh don’t worry I’ll roast him” and I was like um ok. \n\nhe went into my following as followed mark. they talked and stuff and I told the December friend group about this. they said Donald was being annoying(since I also told them about the sister thing) and that I shouldn’t have told him that stuff. \n\nanyway. me and mark broke up(I’ll like to mention me and mark fought every two days and broke up then went back together 12 times) so I was relieved I was finally “single” and no other boys will annoy me…\n\nso it was my 14th birthday and I was having an actual good day being offline and not always talking to them. I started thinking that I should just lose my online friends and actually talk to people so I decided to tell all my friends that but decided to do that on Donald since I didn’t care about him. so suddenly I was suspicious a lot because days before my birthday, my December friend group was debating if Donald liked me or not and Joan told me to say this to me if I get a chance. “I’ll hop on that instead” I didn’t want to and I thought it was gross but he insisted.\n\nanyways I said that and it started becoming sexual as my December friend group was having such a fun time making fun of him and giving me cringey lines to use. I was laughing honestly because I thought it was so gross.\n\nnow cut to my birthday and nana said to confront Donald since she was the one I trusted out of the December friend group and seemed more.. mature? anyways I told her I didn’t want online friends anymore and wanted to talk to my ex friends again as she told me just to ask Donald like “what are we?” and if he says friends that I should just tell him to leave and if he said dating that I should say I didn’t want that and I’m leaving anyway. \n\nso that was the plan, I asked him and he was lik “what do you wanna be” I told nana in a call privately but Joan came in randomly and dared me to say “dating” I didn’t want to and nana said to just leave it but I said it anyway.\n\nsuddenly now I’m dating a boy I didn’t even like. few days go by and my December friends didn’t really like Donald as he was so cringe. which was true. so we started scouting for new boys for me but I didn’t want any. during this Donald asked me weird question overtime and kept making weird jokes which I hated but played along. I didn’t wanna make this kid sad tbh. anyway first Donald told me a weird dare that I should put my elbows together on my chest in front of everyone to prove I’m not “flat”(he loved calling me that). I was weirded out.\n\n\nanyways we met another kid who is the one in most scared of called Jacob. so I started talking to him and I wish I never did because he became sexual to me right away and kept saying stuff about myself. I was so weirded out and wanted to die. I couldn’t take this anymore as i remember that Donald use to send voice recordings to me and I use to record them with another app and sent them to my December friends to make fun of him.\n\nof course Donald was so weird and I hated him but he didn’t deserve to be made fun of. I decided how could I make everyone leave me alone for once? I remembered in 2020 where I did something extreme and “faked my death” and becoming sucidal. I couldn’t take these online friends anymore as they were making me feel so negative. so I decided to send a “suicide” note to everyone saying I was gonna kill myself.\n\n\nthat was terrible and back fired as Donald suddenly texted all my mutuals that I didn’t talk to that I “killed” myself. I was so mad because then Donald and Jacob met(worst thing ever) as they also knew where I live and Donald knew my city. I was so done and it was so annoying getting spammed that I shouldn’t die. \n\nI didn’t actually want to die but I wanted to get away from everyone. so then I came back and they were relieved. well only Donald and Jacob and Dj since everyone else didn’t rlly care and was like “oh damn” \n\nso as I came back I had a new mission. make everyone hate me. my December friends group for some reason I wanted to keep at that time and decided to tell them what happened as they laughed at me for being dramatic and told me if I want them to hate me then I have to act like an incel. I already acted like that before but I felt it was too much. \n\n\nanyways during this time Donald made more weird jokes about his sister. basically we were talking about how me and Jacob don’t gain weight and Donald said he did. anyways he then said he wished he was his sister because she gained weight “in the right places” me and Jacob, it felt like we actually looked at eachother and at him as Donald kept saying she had a nice butt and boobs. it was so weird and I recorded it all and showed it to the December friend group as they had a blast. so anyways, during this\n\nI’ll like to say Jacob had a crush on me and I didn’t tell Donald. I thought that maybe this could make me untrustworthy and Donald would leave me alone. so nothing happened sadly\n\nanyways Jacob and Donald fought a lot and I just wanted to leave. I’m gonna say that I missed actually talking to my real classmates and during this time I just ignored them and acts mean and emo to them. we had alot of beef between as and this was my last school year with them and I wished we could’ve all sorted this out. \n\nthen there was a time where Kay dared me to send “noods” to Donald. I didn’t want to and she said that she will edit it and to make sure it won’t actually show anything and they wont find me. honestly I was actually flat so I actually sent Kay a real photo of my chest with a bra and she edited it and told me to send it to Donald. I was scared and regretted this immediately. I sent it and now, Donald had a photo of my chest. Since Jacob liked me I sent a photo to which I didn’t even think about. \n\n\nanyways then I met a new guy named Connor and I decided that I can finally leave Donald and Jacob because Connor liked me and even tho I didn’t, maybe I could…cheat? the thing is my online group from 2020 hated me because I was a cheater and never talked to me again. not sure if they are still friends or smth but I did tried talking to them again under a fake name but obviously I just thought “maybe it’s for the better” and left. I decided maybe I can make them hate me and they would leave me like how everyone else does.\n\n\n\nI decided to have some thing with Connor as a side relationship and I saw from Mia’s relationship which she showed us that once her boyfriend found a new guy, he immediately ghosted her, ignored her and was being dismissive towards her: I tried that and it was working until they confront me.\n\nfor some reason I mention I was talking to Connor and then Donald went ahead and dmed him. they started talking and out of nowhere and Jacob kept saying stuff racist stuff.\n\nduring this time irl, I caught feelings again for my classmate who I really liked for a while and since this day everyone was busy. I realized how much fun I was having without online friends and how being outside was actually fun.. \n\nso I decided to have some time for myself and make one of my friends pretend to be me. for me being dismissive and rude I was really bad at it so I gave Joan all my socials account passwords. if it was messages I just copy pasted what he sent me to say to them. \n\nduring this time, I met a girl and she was pretty cool. she was new to this school and when I talked to her we liked the same stuff like Taylor swift, Roblox and kdramas. I liked talking to her and it was so fun taking troll pictures of our classmate who she had a crush on for sure. \n\nstuff was going great until Joan had to leave and I had to talk. a small recap was givin to me as I decided to talk to those guys again. I was honestly done with this cycle and just wanted to talk to my real friends.\n\nas we were talking, I also gave Donald a few days back my social account passwords and since he noticed I was being more meaner, he looked though my messages(fyi, this entire time I had a burner account to talk to Donald,Jacob,Connor etc so nobody knows about the December friend group) \n\nanyways Donald saw my messages and I only had nana and Mia with me. I was a little scared but nana said this could be my time to leave those guys.\n\nbasically I told them I didn’t want anything to do with them and I’m breaking up and I never wanna talk to them again. I decided to block them and it was fine until.\n\novertime Jacob kept making alt accounts to text me aswell as Dj (as I stopped being friends with him too) and Donald. \n\nthen Connor was scared and found out that Donald knew it this was just so messy. \n\nI’m a little thankful for nana and Mia for helping me deescalate this situation. anyways it was the last days of school and I started ignoring everyone even Connor who also kept begging me for a face reveal. it was a week before grad and I had a fun time with my class and I decided to block everyone and I mean everyone and start new. but Jacob found me again and this is what was making me scared this whole time\n\nhe told me that he was gonna expose me and leak my “noods” even tho they were fake, I was so scared and I didn’t want anybody finding out as btw, since they have my phone number, my class tiktok account leaked and Jacob messaged my classmates.\n\nI’m just so scared my classmates might find out about this and I hope they haven’t.Anyways I had the last day with my class and everyday I wish I can go back and actually make an apology to my classmates because we were all in the wrong but nope. my entire time was taken up by online friends.\n\nduring these few months, Mia,Joan,nana and Kay were a little mad and Kay kinda threaten my with the chest pic but she didn’t know about my classmates and when I told them all I was done. they were mad and said they didn’t care. but nana messaged me privately and told me good luck and not to worry because it’s not like Jacob will fly out to my country and do stuff. I just hope they would leave me alone.even tho they did threaten me and also Jacob did see my face by mistake on call since he always wanted to call me. I was just scared but then I got over it.\n\nuntil now when someone messaged me and I got ptsd and flashbacks. I also had a dream that Jacob leaked everything and I was the laughingstock of tiktok. It was just weird because I thought I forgot about them. anyways I’m so glad I let this out and to anybody reading this, please reassure me or tell me something and what you thought. it’s so long but I hope you guys can help me. (I’ll like to mention Jacob and Donald and Connor were racist aswell as Kay and mark, they are homophobic, transphobic etc and always said every slur in the book, I also only talked to them becaue I was bored and I thought(okay it shouldn’t be that bad they would leave me right? like how everyone else does and it’s just until the summer break. it was only because nobody talked to me during school and I was bored so I needed a friend.) thank you for listening and lmk if I was in the wrong or if this is just something for me to laugh at years later. \n",

I was diagnosed with autism at the age of three and I feel like that put a toll on my parents mental health trying to find ways to help me as a kid but they are all good now. All my life I’ve been bullied. Not because of the autism but because I’m an easy target. I made lots of mistakes in my grade 7-9 years. I became a gang kid in hopes of becoming a popular kid. I smoked weed, got in trouble and just acted like a dick head. I dated the school wh0re, got raped, stripped of my virginity, and got bullied because of it. Broke up with her and fell into a deep depression. Abused my meds, smoked weed constantly and got drunk on top of it. One night a girl on snap constantly asked me for a pic while I was drunk and high… I did it… then it was sent all around the school. All of that would f#ck up my whole social life. Now im a metal head. Nothing like what I was before. I’m a loser. Barely any friends. Alone. My parents always asks me “have any plans tonight?”… I say the same thing I have said for over five years. “Not a damn thing.” I have put myself out there but I give up. Each time I do I let people take advantage of me and mess me up more. My depression is out of control but not as bad as a few months ago. I started talking to a girl I like but now she’s being very very dry and it’s messing with my overthinking. I hate everything… but I hate myself the most. ",

I won’t go into the specifics, but from being constantly criticized growing up, to losing my dad in my life, and two of my sisters due to reasons I had no control over, I’ve developed one hell of an abandonment wound.\n\nIt’s crazy. Two years ago I was homeschooled and had no friends and felt so hopeless. Now I’m at college, with an amazing girlfriend and friends who I all life very much, and that feeling of hopelessness hasn’t completely gone away. I’m home for spring break right now, and I notice that’s when most of my negative emotions come up.\n\nI love my family so much. We’ve all been through so much together but I just feel like they sometimes don’t understand me, or really appreciate who I am as a person. I know they care about me a lot, but I feel like my friends value my presence a lot more.\n\nIdk I just feel a lot of bad emotions. Low self esteem, so exhausted, a little angry and I don’t know why. I just wish I was secure in myself. I’m so not. I overthink everything with relationships, especially with my girlfriend. I choose not to let my past trauma define me or give me excuses to be a dipshit brother, boyfriend, etc. That’s what my twin sister chose to do. Even tho she’s kind of a terrible person I really miss her.\n\nI just feel like I’m trying so hard everyday to conquer my negative self, and I just wish I heard someone tell me how strong I was. Even tho I really don’t feel like I am.\n\nI just don’t know what’s wrong with me. Life is really good right now. School is stressful, but I just can’t handle life’s overwhelm as well as everyone else it seems.\n\nIt’s like there’s this logical part of me that knows who I want to be— confident, assertive but kind, just a good person. And then there’s this instinctual part that’s trying to take the wheel— angry, hurt, sensitive, and that’s my first reaction in most situations.",

I travel, pass most of college classes, hang out with friends, and currently have good relationships with my family. But I’m tired, and not a burnt-out tired. It’s an indescribable type of exhaustion. I think of suicide everyday, even when my day is going fine. One of my biggest fears is being seen as attention seeking, and I know my friends and family don’t understand because of comments they have made in the past.

Somehow, I’ve managed to hold it together—pushed through, masked it well enough to build what looks like a “perfect” life. Got the wife, the nice house, the cars, multiple trips a year all over the world. Money’s not a problem. On paper, I’ve got it made. But inside, I’m just… fucking empty. The last few years have shredded whatever grip I had on keeping up the act, and I feel like I’m hitting my breaking point.\n\nTwo years ago, my dad—the only parent I’ve had since I was 14—died out of nowhere. It blindsided me. Prior to that, less than a year of my dad dying both my grandparents (his parents) passed too. All three family members I had left gone in a year. It’s like my whole foundation got ripped out from under me. On top of that, my wife and I have been battling infertility for 3 years—countless treatments, hundreds of thousands of dollars, mostly covered by my job’s insurance. Speaking of work, it’s a soul-crushing mundane existence. I hate it. It’s unfulfilling, my coworkers and I don’t mesh. But I can’t leave—the insurance is why we can even keep fighting the infertility battle. So I’m trapped.\n\nLately, my wife and I are barely on the same page. We’re fighting constantly, disconnected as hell, and I feel like she’s more of a roommate—or worse, a parent—than a partner. I’m so alone in all this. The sadness and numbness are swallowing everything. Normally, I can mask it—smile, crack a joke, keep it moving. But I’m slipping. I’m getting sloppy, dropping balls I’d usually juggle without blinking. I don’t care about shit I used to—like the house, the trips, the image. It’s all hollow.\n\nI don’t know how to keep pretending. I’ve got everything I’m “supposed” to want, but I’m drowning. Normally I can recognize it and tidy it up enough to hide it. \n\nBut this time?

Most of the Times, I leave her be for a Bit, in hope for things to settle down and then approach her by asking things like \"How are you feeling?\" \"Do you wanna talk?\" or \"I don't know\n what is going on but I would like to change things, since I care about you.\".\nSometimes she does respond to these rather good and we're able to sort things out, but most of the time, she says things like \" I think I should leave\", \"I am always hurting you\" or \"Just leave me alone, don't you see how Bad you feel because of me?\" \n\nIn the early stages of our relationship I always tried to show her that things aren't as Bad, I'm fine and such things, but by now, I for one don't want to lie so much anymore and second, can't do so mentally either, because I can really feel the impact that has on me too. So then we go into a sort of stalemate in which nobody says anything for atleast 15-30min, often longer. I really can't stand this, it makes me feel horrible because I feel  like I am failing as a boyfriend but at the same time, I sort of feel unable to move or say anything, because of her harsh acting, I don't feel loved or anything. It is really hard to describe really. \n\nAfter this feelingly endless time period of just sitting there quietly, she usually approaches me by cuddling or anything similar and she Starts talking to me a Bit. That's usually the point where the ice breaks and things settle down, but even here I need to be extremely careful, because as soon as I say anything that she could interpret as critizing her, she feels horrible because she thinks that she is consistently making my life worse and such things and the cycle Starts all over again.\n\nThat also makes it seemingly Impossible for me to approach her in a critizing manner, or even just trying to tell her how I feel in such Situations, or any Situation where I don't feel great, because she immediately feels extremely guilty and goes into this state where a constructive conversation is impossible.\n\nI'd really like some Feedback on what I can do to improve the situation, as I myself notice how much this is impacting me mentally aswell.",

I’ve gone through the dating apps , friends of friends, everything, but I just can’t seem to click with anyone. \n\nOver the last 2 years, I have made some serious changes to my health. There is a post on my profile about it, but basically I went from drinking 40ish beers a week to occasionally 2 a week, if that. I have lost 60 lbs, I go to the gym to keep myself in the best shape I’ve ever been in, and I work construction. \n\nI did all of these changes for me, for my health, but I’d be lying if I said I didn’t want a relationship out of it. I constantly seem to end up in the friend zone. I’m not particularly good at talking to girls, though I think I’m better now than I used to be. \n\nThis all came to a head over the last couple weeks. I met a girl at my climbing gym and hit it off with her. We started climbing together a bunch, hung out for a bite to eat a few times, and I thought the vibes were great. She even told me that she was really looking forward to spending time with me. \n\nLast weekend, we went out for a chill night out together and again I thought we were hitting things off really well. I dropped her off at her place, said goodnight and made tentative plans to hang out during this past week. When I got home though, I got that dreaded text that I’ve gotten 1000 times before: “I just got out of a really toxic relationship, and as much as I like spending time with you, I’m not ready for that again yet”. \n\nI immediately felt all of that old self doubt slamming into me like a ton of bricks. I sent her a message saying I understood, and I hoped we could still spend time together as friends, seeing if maybe this could turn into something. She heart reacted that, and responded absolutely. I figured at least that’s a start. However, she has not responded to hardly any messages this week. The plan had been for me to help her move some furniture and other things this week, but each time I asked for a time to help her out, she came up with some reason why she couldn’t(they could be true, probably are, just feels like she’s avoiding me). \n\nAll of this is just sparking all of my old self-doubt and depression.

    "body": "So, a little backstory.\nI have a band with two other people, we're like partners. It's a side hustle, if you will. We do hang out regularly, but music is mostly what unites us. \nOne of the two stopped responding to calls about a month ago.\nWe had a project he should be producing and we already moved the deadline three times due to him not being able to finish it. When he missed the third deadline, we tried to call him to tell him that we're moving on to some other projects, that we assume he has too much going on and that we understand, but he stopped responding. After trying to reach him for three days, I wrote him a (somewhat) angry text that this is becoming tiresome and that we're moving on to another album. \nNo response. We figured something was up that he doesn't respond for that long. We then messaged him several times if he's okay to no avail. \nWe are now in a sort of limbo, since he is a vital part of our operation here and we just... don't know what's going on. It's been like this for three weeks now. Doesn't answer calls, no posts online (he used to post regularly). When we called him several times last weekend, he hung up and texted \"can't talk, not home\". We incidentally drove by his house the same day and his car was home, but we didn't want to push it. A week has passed, we called again. He wrote the same thing. We decided to drive to his house. Turns out he was home. His dad greeted us outside and went to get him, then came back to tell us he's cooking a family lunch and can't talk right now, but that he promised he'd stop by our house in the afternoon. He never came.\nWe called him twice later in the day, he hung up every time. \nNow, this isn't the first time it happened, but it was never as bad. Usually it was just a week of silence, then an apology text about how he had too much work and was tired, and we always understood. He was never a good communicator. \nBut it's been getting worse and worse, even before he comepletely cut contact, he would be less and less responsive. Right before this episode, he would do the absolute bare minimum of work we had to do, nothing more. And we'd be feeling more and more like we're a burden and that he doesn't actually want to work with us. He would take less time fkr meetings and rehearsals and would always argue that he doesn't have the time.\nSo we're really lost here. I don't know if he's burnt out, or depressed, or just doesn't want to work with us anymore and is too afraid to tell us. I feel like we would at least deserve an answer, out of respect, and I think it's childish to avoid someone you're basically working with. If we were just friends, I would patiently wait for him to come back when he feels like it, but we had some agreements, made some deals involving money etc etc and it's becoming more and more difficult to manage it all.\n\nA part of me wants to just kick him out, while a part of me wants to sit it out and wait, like a friend would. But it has started to really affect me emotionally.\nSorry for the long post. I need some advice.",

There have been moments where glimpses of his old self come through, but they usually don’t last long before he falls back into old patterns.\n\nHe’s been open with our family about not feeling mentally well, which I appreciate. His life now seems to revolve almost entirely around his computer — he works at the PC, then plays games for hours, and smokes weed regularly. It feels like he’s stuck in a loop. Conversations with him are hard; after just a couple of minutes, the tone usually shifts to negativity about life, work, or people in general. He often seems angry or bitter, and it’s hard to talk to him without feeling like you're walking on eggshells.\n\nWhat’s also difficult is that our conversations are completely one-sided. He rarely, if ever, asks how I’m doing or shows interest in anyone else. When I do ask him something, it can feel like a burden for him to answer. I’ve offered my support many times — whether that’s talking, helping him get into training, or improving his daily routines — but he always declines.\n\nThe hard part for me now is that I’ve started to feel incredibly frustrated. I’m finding it more and more exhausting to be around him. His pessimism and self-centered outlook are really draining my energy, and sometimes I even find myself getting angry with him — even though I know he’s not well.\n\nSo my question is: how can I, as a relative, actually support him without burning myself out in the process? What can I do that could make a difference — if anything — and when is it okay to step back?\n\nWe had a family dinner today and I am so exhausted, it's like he drained all my energy.",

I am told to get help but it feels like I'm being punished for reaching out for it. The harder I try, The more that gets taken away. I'm sitting and watching things that are absolutely devastating to me and I'm expected to just sit there and not even cry. I gave up. I don't do this very often but I gave up.

I've been to multiple therapists I can afford. I'm a therapist myself. I have a lot of responsibilities and I'm just tired of them. What's worse is the idea of just letting myself go is scarier that going on the brink of burnout. My depression makes it hard to keep going, but I still have to. \n\nBeing a therapist brought me a lot of shame. As a therapist, my whole job hinges on being able to help so the prospect of compassion fatigue or emotional burnout scares me. I know I will be well and beyond spent before I just finally rest. I guess I wish I had more juice to keep going and not be so nerfed all the time. I am embarassed of being human.

I have no connections to anyone. I am in a town where I was not treated kindly and I don't have connections here other than going to the grocery store for food, going to the liquor store and buying some alcohol when I am paid so I can drink a bit on the weekends, and other restaurants because I find myself unmotivated and frankly feeling depressed with my existence unless I am working.\n\nI hate that I feel this way, and the simple truth of the matter is I know once my apartment is cleaner or clean I will feel better, but how do you give yourself the kick in the pants to do it?",

Hope your all having a good day/ evening, wherever you are inside this big blue bubble. \n\nI have a question for some people on here, where ever in the world they are. As someone without a disability, why do people judge me as someone that would be stupid just for having a disability? How can I truly feel happy after I’ve been alone for so long? \n\nI have barely 1st stage autism, it has gone away drastically since I was little, but ever since I was little, I always had no idea how to talk to people. I drive, read, and I’m trying to become a computer engineer, but i also tried to be a game designer and developer, my childhood dream. I found out programming for me in game design would not be nice for me. Broke my heart, had to switch to something else completely, I was shy, quiet and wasn’t for a long time, but once again i am, due to some extremely poor friend suggestions and behavior completely on their part, which I feel have ruined my happiness completely out of my life.\nI was blackmailed by my friend group I met with my buddy from elementary. They accused my account with an easy to guess password, and exposed me and my girlfriend’s private chats all for everyone to see. With the whole kit and kabob if you know what I mean in those types of things in a relationship via messages when two people love each other. \nWas bullied so badly in school I literally felt like I had to act stupid all the time, just to make friends. I hate I did this, if I just kept being myself and I had more strength and courage, I could’ve been done with it all. But I didn’t. \nNow, have a large former group of Friends now making fun of my body, my decisions and my poor choice actions, get told to end my life, we aren’t your friends, get the fuck away from me, or fuck off. Try to always act like it’s not a big deal shit they say, I don’t care, it’s all online shit on game chat it doesn’t matter bro, your a pussy. Makes my teeth begin to get locked jawed from anger. Even meet with these people in person to become friends, only for them to still make fun of me in person with one single friend who introduced me, and another friend who left me being a friend as a kid because I showed them five nights at Freddy’s in fucking grade 11, runs to his mom, she says I’m a bad influence and we shouldn’t hang anymore. Older brother also likes to beat me up or make fun of me, especially as children. Now he’s just a fat dummy with a big mouth, and no future. And even though I may have one, I really, really feel like hatred goes through my body when thinking of anybody inside of that type of space all jumping together on someone who didn’t do anything wrong. Nobody helps anymore, they just attack. And it’s making me lethally Angered. \nI’ve always been also that kind of extremely over nice person, always giving people my lunch good in elementary and in high school just a class clown making people laugh, but while being fat. and now, my whole life, i feel now autism, which people have said is a superpower, which I used to believe, I feel it’s a curse. I lost my girlfriend after she found out my forms friends had shared photos of us online and made me so upset she stopped messaging me, I have no more friends and I just stare at my tv after slaving away at school, and end the day. Parents have been my only support my entire life along with my brother. Everyone on my life even from early age has passed and I miss them and it haunts me and I have nightmares about the earth ending, me having no future, etc. \nMy best friend, my entire life ive ever met who even remotely was with me everywhere, spending time with me 247 everyday all day, obviously is my parents and family / friends, but my dog. \n\nThese so called friends also go on to make fun of my dying grandfather in bed and insult him dying on his death bed. Then when my dog dies last may last year after I told them a few months before I never wanted to see them again, explode and cause a massive scene at my house because of my explosive episodes when I’m angry. Week later, my best friends body was shutting down. In less than 48 hours after this. My best friend was now dead. And it felt as if it was partially been my own actions to cause it. Always have explosive episodes where I used to threaten myself or others who hurt me, only ever got bad to the point in class, one of these kids from this group, but years before, made me so angry with suicidal thoughts, I stood up \n\nAnd began to try to cute my throat with a pair of cutting scissors, I wanted to be happy, leave me alone. 10 years later these demons are still with me inside my mind, I can’t stop these thoughts, and I just want to be, even though I could or should be happy, I really. \n\nI think I just want someone genuinely who hasn’t met me, to just love who I am. Why is this so hard to find now today? And why do those people who look get punished often for doing so? \n\nI’ve been to therapy, I’ve been working out, I have been making myself better. But truthfully, I think it’s felt hurt wise even more impactful now, with all this built up stress. \n\nI’m almost done college, I want to pass this because I want to tell everyone who ever thought I would fail, I can do anything, and anyone can to if they put their mind to it. \n\nI don’t know anymore. I just feel off, I’m alone, and I wish honestly truthfully, more women out there were nicer to men especially when that person might be experiencing PTSD, MPD, Bipolarism or even extreme hormonal rampages by feeling angry. All this has built up in me since I’ve been in grade 8, probably around 12 years old? 13? \n\nAlso my teacher before high school was a drill Sargent jackass type teacher, who terrified me to my core. He didn’t help students. He scared them. Also he was going to be a police officer but failed do to him not being able to do efficient takedowns with standard policing equipment. \n\nBuilding rage inside me, fires burning inside my sky’s, the room stays dry. Shit never changes. When will someone please kindle my fire? I don’t know anymore.\n\n\nWill these kids ever apologize to me? If even one childhood bully talked to me again, and apologized i would feel, somewhat, “happy”. I have a hard time smiling even now, i feel that miserable with my current life. And i even just got a new dog only a couple months ago. What the fuck is wrong with me? \n\nMy teeth bite my nails down to the nail line. The pain never goes away, but it doesn’t feel any different to the shit and pain I’ve already been through. That’s what sucks the most. And I know I can achieve great things. I believe I can. But it feels hard these days in my shoes. Personally. And I wish I could use honestly or see a bit more stuff in this planet that could firstly, come meet me, and not me, having to practically beg and walk over to them. I’m sick of doing that shit my whole life. \n\n\nSomeone, please. Help me. \n\nFlynn \n- Niagara Falls, Ont, Canada",

    "body": "For some reason, I find it really difficult to initiate conversations or send replies to someone through texts or e-mails. There are a few people who I have been able to get to know face-to-face, but for some reason I can't bring myself to talk to them through the internet. I keep on second-guessing myself, my mind coming up with the worst-case scenario. There's this constant assumption that the other person doesn't want to talk to me and get to know each other better.\n\nThis becomes worse in situations I get left on read - even if it's someone who I enjoy talking to, it's really hard to start another conversation because I fear that I'm being left on read because the other person has no interest in interacting with me.\n\nI also put off replying to texts all the time. It's like I have to forcefully muster up courage for me to give a reply. Even when the other person's reply is quick, it takes hours or even days for me to give a response. It's to the degree where people are telling me to reply faster.\n\nIt's not something that should be hard to do, and I know in the back of my head that it's a factor in my inability to socialize with others. Even so, I just can't seem to maintain conversations. And what's even more frustrating is I can't grasp why I'm like this. I thought I was just procrastinating, but the thing is, I want to converse, I want to talk more with others, but I can't. Can I label it procrastination if it's a task you want to do?\n\nSo I've been wondering if this problem is related to my depression, or some other another mental disorder.\n\nHas anyone experienced this?",

I’ve gone to my doctors, my family knows how I feel and are as supportive as they can be, but nothing is helping it’s just getting worse. I don’t want to stress my family out too much but I don’t know how much more of this feeling I can cope with. Anyone have any advice on how to try deal with these feelings?

Figured this is a subreddit that won’t judge since a lot of us are in the same boat. \n\nI’m a dog walker, but that doesn’t mean I always get a ton of exercise (I’m 24, 5’6 f weighing 170 lbs) I eat only processed foods and frozen foods and have a bad sugar addiction. I’ve struggled with severe depression and anxiety since middle school and it’s only gotten worse as an adult (going days without showering, changing my clothes, no hope or plans for the future, etc.) I have a terrible spending problem, and even though I work a ton and work really hard I blow through my paychecks on anime merch and food (I can’t continue school because I owe too much in tuition and it’s been sent to collections) and payment plans to pay for these things which siphon all of my money as a result. I feel little motivation to do things I like doing, and don’t feel pleasure from doing those things. I live with my mom, she pays rent and all bills. I hate myself and feel extreme guilt for being alive. \n\nI have friends but struggle maintaining relationships due to my mental health. I have no desire for a romantic relationship, instead I invest my time and money into collecting merch of an male anime character I’m in love with and through this ficto relationship don’t feel the need to seek irl companionship.\n\nI want to be a good person. I want to feel like a good person. But I have no more energy. No energy to even muster up the empathy and compassion I’ve always felt for others. I stopped volunteering at a wildlife center because I couldn’t get myself out of bed. I only move to go to work or to get something to eat. It’s like you’re trapped in a cell underwater looking up at yourself above the surface. Trapped you is screaming and surface you can see but you can’t merge, you can’t change. \n\nI was hospitalized thrice in high school and have been on many different meds, but don’t feel anything. I think when you’re young like me depression doesn’t seem like the end all be all. Because you’re young people still see hope and potential and beauty in your youth. But once I get past 25 and age starts creeping in suddenly there’s no beauty or potential in my life. I’m old and ugly inside and out and no pity is given to the decrepit members of society. ",

Even back in 6th grade, I had the same overwhelming feelings. I come from a toxic family—my mom has narcissistic tendencies, and my dad constantly plays the victim while badmouthing everyone around him. They manipulate in their own ways. They’ve been separated for almost five years now, and even though things got better at first, it’s getting worse again. They absolutely hate each other.\n\nOn top of that, we have financial problems, and my mom keeps pushing me to get a job. But I feel like I just can’t. I have no motivation, no energy—I feel like I’m stuck in a hole I can’t climb out of. I’m 18 now, and I always thought I wouldn’t make it past 18. I never planned for anything beyond this point. Now I’m here, and everything just feels empty.\n\nI failed my exams, so I have to decide whether to retake school or do something else, but I don’t even know what I’m capable of anymore. I’m currently doing an internship, but after that, I have no idea what comes next. It all just feels pointless.\n\nI take medication for my depression, but let’s be honest—no pills can fix a toxic environment. I want to move out so badly, but I have no money, no job, no plan. My mom constantly stresses me out, and my brother doesn’t really care—he’s the “golden child” who can do no wrong. I think I’m my dad’s favorite, but that just means he uses me as his emotional dumping ground, and I can’t handle that either.\n\nI’ve considered hospitalization, but what would that even change? My mom doesn’t believe in mental health issues, and my dad would just make it weird. My brother is younger than me, and I don’t want to burden him with this.\n\nI just don’t see a way out. I believe in God and try to remind myself that there’s a plan for me, but I don’t know what it is. I just want to be happy like everyone else. I don’t know why I have to suffer like this when I’ve done nothing to deserve it.\n\nI’ve been in therapy for two years, and my therapist is kind and understanding, but at the end of the day, she can’t change my home life. I don’t know what to do anymore.\n\nIf anyone has any advice or has been through something similar, please, I’d really appreciate hearing from you.",

I'm so lonely that it's all i can feel these days. i feel like I'm in solitary confinement, watching everyone else get to have fun and be social. i don't know what makes me so different, so fundamentally unlikeable, but when i find it, I'll happily remove it from myself if i can, even if it takes a huge chunk of my personality with it. I'm so desperate for social interaction that i cry at the thought of having a friend one day.\n\ni think i just wanted to write something about my recent experiences that other people might see.

I’ve been in therapy since 2021 and matured a lot but it’s not working anymore. The ruminations are getting worse, my grandmother passed in December and i can’t stop crying everyday.\n\nIn short.. how do you defeat ruinations? Mine are bad. I’m constantly picturing myself having to fight over and over again or someone trying to hurt me. I’m a really kind person who has been “burned” many times before and it’s left me scared, sad and now angry.\n\nI’m becoming angry and mad. I play shooters to let it out but I never used to rage this hard before. I know I must be unrecognizable to my boyfriend and I snap at him so much now.

I'm practically a shut-in who only goes to school unwillingly.\n\nAnd even when one of the people who used to defend me asked how I was doing, I was too afraid to even talk to him.\n\nIn times like these, I can't help but wish I hadn’t been born in the first place. Even when I was defended, I knew I'd eventually have to go back home. a place I never liked. I'm not living with my parents, and I always feel like I'm being judged.\n\nThe people who defended me are about my age, too.\n\nSorry if this isn’t depressing enough for this sub and if its messy ",

I'm currently staying with my boss. \n\nI think I'm in shock. I asked her if she wanted to fix our marriage and she has not given me an answer. Now I feel like she's been planning this for a while.

My skin was more elastic, my hair fuller, my charisma was effortless. Makeup and outfit ideas were popping up in my mind like the silly blonde girl in clueless. How could someone with no real value or love for anything but herself get rewarded so much compared to the now changed girl who doesn't want anything handed to her, who chooses to live life in the real world instead of living in a facade, who chooses what I should do rather than what I want to do, who is trying to burn my ego because it is quite literally turning me into a sociopath!!!! I guess that's the reason for freewill though. I'm thinking out loud. I can't just discard all this away this time it needs to stay. honestly would like just to have you read it and not comment because interactions are getting harder to deal with the older I get. Maybe I was more disciplined with the energy that was received being ignorant. It was never meant to last if I was still walking down that path. It didn't last. Now I am living in truth and some days I have to try harder than others because I still do struggle with human impulse. I think it's just a symptom of being human but damn does growing up hurt.",

My parents won’t let me back home unless I am in aa which I was before and it ruined my entire perception of myself in a bad way and sort of led me to end up in the hospital and mental wards so I don’t want to go back to a closed mind thinking aa is the only way of life. I don’t even think I am an alcoholic as I am able to put it down quite easily. I only make minimum wage so I can’t afford rent anywhere and  most people I knew don’t talk to me anymore. I just feel so lonely and lost and suicidal. I mean I have never felt so low in my life. I am very lucky to have a car a job and a few close friends to keep me company and sane but sometimes the bad just overweighs everything. I have also racked up hospital bills which make me very scared financially which just adds to the clutter in my brain and I constantly have ocd attacks about losing my job all day everyday. Idk how I can or am going to push through this period in my life but at this point it’s either drugs, suicide, or moving forward. Sorry for the depressing rant lol gotta get it out somehow",

I wish I could die right now with no pain. I don't want to kill myself because if I miss there will be even more pain. I wish I could get my revenge on society. The enemies that got me where I am today, it would be such a party if they died. That's one reason for me to try and survive the longest, to see the enemies die, such satisfaction it would give. 3:20am going to bed now, where ill be stuck until 9pm sucks real bad. So now at least I have one goal, survive the longest possible to have the possibility of seeing enemies die. Its just a real boring surviving, doing nothing except freaking appointments i hate and going to the pharmacy. Cheers to all who survive out there and don't kill themselves.

    "body": "Depressed boyfriend turned toxic and I need to know if its normal\n\nMy boyfriend is battling depression. He has zero energy for any kind of social interaction. He doesn't want to work. Sleeps a lot. Is pushing me away when I want to help or stonewalling me.\n\nHis ex took him to court for a custody battle that is draining him emotionally and financially. She's forbidding him to see his kids. It's been difficult for him.\n\nOne thing about me and my bf, I've always told him he could be himself around me. No mask, no fakeness, just him communicating his feelings. \n\nLately he's been toxic and projecting those emotions onto me.\nThe caring man he used to be is now rude to me.\nYesterday something happened and I called him. He came to help. He told me to let him know the outcome of my misadventures the next day, that's today.\n\nI texted him, asking if he was free for a call so I call and tell him what happened. He replied: Do I really give off the vibe right now that I want to talk with you? That's a serious question. I didn't reply.\n\nLast week, we were talking and he was his usual sweet man. He told me he couldn't wait to see me. Said I love you. Really made me feel better.\n\nEarlier this week I asked him what he wanted to do, he got upset saying he didn't remember saying we should hang out and told me I was making him feel crazy.\nBut two hours later he apologized, saying work is stressful and he's gonna make time for me.\n\nWhen I was over to his place, he was sweet for an hour and then he out of nowhere started an argument about plans we made and he called me toxic for reminding him of the conversation we had. I asked him to stop, that I was there to spend quality time with him. He didn't. Kept going. I cried. I needed to step away from the situation. He chased me. When I returned he hugged me for 5 long minute and apologized. Said he'd make an effort to stop pushing me away.\n\nSometimes I will ask him what he's up to at night and he'll say things like: Being extremely uninterested in having a conversation.\nOr Why are you trying to force a conversation?\n\nBefore being depressed he was never this rude to me. Ever.\n\nTonight, in the span on 5 mins, he told me he didn't wanna talk to me. When I didn't reply he went hello???? And 3 mins later: Amazing communication! This is why I push you away!!\n\nI've been depressed myself before but I never projected my emotions like that or turned mean towards the person I love the most.\n\nWhat's going on, why is he like that now?\n😞",

We're still together and for all intents and purposes happy, as I have forgiven her and taken responsibility of my part where I had fallen short to give her a reason to do so however, since then my depression feels much mor severe.

Even the so called good moments are just empty to me. \n\nI have been told that I have treatment resistant depression as I've gone through SSRIs, SNRIs, benzo, natural remedies (shrooms and LSD micro and macrodosing), CBT therapy, DBT, the works and nothing has helped. \n\nI can't commit suicide because my family will be destroyed and it's not like my death would hugely impact them for the better financially. I run my own business but the more my depression increases the worse the business is doing and the worse it does the worse my depression gets.

I avoid such conversations but sometimes i break and say a few things before again running away. \n\nI tried to end it but is too much of a fucking coward to do that too! Got a motorcycle recently so I'm planning to get into an accident soon one way or the other. I just need to make sure no one else gets hurt.\n\nI feel zero motivation, zero drive and has nothing to look forward. I still miss her. I miss holding hands and our bus rides when i kiss her on her forehead.\n\nI asked her for a swcond chance but she is too much hurt that she started seeing a therapist. I would have loved if she killed me with her own hands. \n\nLife is kicking me down. I can't get up.\nThere is nobody to talk to. I want to go somewhere far away but then again change of environment won't solve my issues. I know that. \n\nI shouldn't have said yes. I shouldn't have been born.\nThese days I'm just a walking, eating, shitting piece of flesh that has no sense of belonging, or worth.\n",

I can never do anything right and it just seems like I’m annoying everybody tbh. I can barely even stand up for myself and I let people just do whatever they want to me sometimes. I don’t even wanna start working. I don’t really have that much of a good social life like I go out once in a few months and don’t really know how to maintain friendships. I can’t even do anything to myself either because that would be very much selfish and would hurttt my fam. That why I just blame whoever it was that put me on this earth. My parents, God or whoever it was that chose to make me feel like this. \n\n",

    "body": "Thought I'd give an update since the last time I posted was months ago but things have gotten better and worse at the same time. Every time I think I've got this living on my own thing down it's like everything gathers together to kick me back down. I live off a check I get from a booth my dad had before he passed away in a consignment shop but without him constantly going there to sell things in person, it's only bringing around $600 a month. And some times not even that. This month I made absolutely nothing, in fact I owed them money for the rent. That booth is the only income I have but if it keeps on like this I'll have to put a stop to it but if I do that I'll have no income whatsoever. The house is paid off thankfully so I don't have to worry about that and I applied for snap benefits as well so that has helped. But I'm just not sure how long I can keep going like this. My dad passed away late last September and since then I've held a gun to my head twice, thought about it even more but it was twice that I nearly went through with it. The reasons I haven't is because of my dogs and now my aunt. My uncle and I have been a huge burden on her, she comes here to help take care of my uncle, brings us food, and even helps clean the house some times. I don't have life insurance and I know if I died, all those bills for a funeral and all that would go to her. I'm enough of a burden to her as it is I don't want my death to be an even bigger burden. I wouldn't care if she tossed my body in the woods and forgot all about me but I know she wouldn't do that. So I'm back to playing the waiting game. Wait until I get life insurance, wait until my dogs pass away. I just hope I can make it until then, there are days when I feel like I can't. I'm not good at talking about my feelings with the people around me so no one knows any of this. Not even my best friend since I was in 2nd grade. (I'm 30 now) She's the only friend I have but it feels like I'm staying the same and she's moving on. She rarely talks to me anymore. She has other friends, a job, a life. We live pretty far from each other now, in different states, but we used to always talk over discord. Play games together and things like that. I've sent her messages but she hasn't responded to me since January. Not like I blame her, I'm sure I'm annoying her when I send her messages all the time but I just I don't really have anyone else to talk too. I really only leave the house once a month to pick up my check from the store and to pay bills. She's the only friend I have, I've never been good at making friends because of my social anxiety. The only person I see every day is my uncle but he's not really someone I can talk too. He has a mental disability due to seizures and because of that he has the mind of a 7 year old. I take care of him, not the other way around. I have a boyfriend but it's long distance and to be honest, I've built myself in his eyes as this always happy person, I've never told him or let it show how depressed I really am. I've never told him about my thoughts of wanting to die at all. I've tried to only show him the good in me and I'm scared that if I show him everything he'll think it's too much or he'll down play it. I've thought about telling him but for some reason I just can't bring myself too. I see my aunt every week but she's not someone I can really talk too either. Deep down I know she does care for me but another part of me thinks that the only reason she comes around so often is just for my uncle. If he wasn't here, she wouldn't be either. She's talked about him moving in with her because he has mobility issues and the our house is it's hard to get him out so if he ever has a medical emergency it'd be really difficult to get him to a hospital and I understand that, and I know it'd be easier for me money wise and all that if he did move in with her. But at the same time if that did happen I'd be completely alone. My aunt would have no reason to come by anymore and it'd just be me in this house. I'm already having issues trying to keep myself alive for the limited time frame I've given myself, I have no idea how much harder it'd be if I was alone. \n\nI don't know. At this point I'm just rambling. Sorry. ",

I just couldn't help it, I feel happy when I think of myself finally dying\n\n\nEvery night I delay my sleep because I hate myself, dread having to be alive for another day, and, well, night time is much more peaceful than day time, isn't it?

    "title": "I’ve spent the past three years in hardship and all my efforts feel wasted & idk what to do now. Need advice.",
    "body": "Soooooo. Where do I start?\nThis is gonna be a long one.\n\nBack in 2022/2023 I was working in retail at a pet store. Not the greatest gig, but it was relatively stable. I was struggling with time demands because the work was physically intensive in terms of labor (Petcare) and I was working around 45/50 hours and I only had 15 minute breaks during my shifts.\nAt the time I was able to meet financial deadlines, but I eventually got burnt out with everything else happening in my personal life. Hard disappointments from my dating life, an apartment flood, and not being able to really take care of myself or my own creative pursuits.\nI worked and worked and worked, and then I had more and more time difficulties. Even if I was getting the rest I needed, i would flounder and loose myself and crawl back to bed. I sometimes would routinely pull all nighters because I’d miss getting to work on time. Eventually I got one of those angry vibrating alarm clocks. That didn’t help either.\n\nEventually I got fired (on my birthday of all days) this past year. Couldn’t get unemployment so while job searching I decided to pick up sex work as a “masseuse.” Did get routine clients. Was making some kind of money, but not enough and I was behind on my bills. Eventually I got a hosting gig at a restaurant next door. Good people, meaningless work, still behind on bills. Spent the next few months getting my shit together and it was very hard.\n\nThen in November, I landed a really cute gig as a dresser for a touring company. I can’t talk about who I was working with because they’re prevelent figures in the arts and I don’t wanna get sued. But the pay was good and I had friends I’d be working with so sounded like an ok deal. I didn’t expect how absolutely hard it was.\nSo I traveled the US for thanksgiving and Christmas on a tour bus. I worked the hardest I ever had getting every performer dressed on time and que, moving garments and props, steaming, repairing, sewing, cleaning wigs and shoes, helping with makeup, being their therapist, their bartender, etc. I was exhausted. I’d wake up get to work, run a marathon the whole day, and get back on the bus and cry in my sleep, then the next city, same thing, no off days, for 50 days.\nSome of the crew did not like me, I was ok with that, but the friend I had on tour now don’t talk to me and idk what I did. I think I did the best I could for my skill set and first time on the road doing this kind of work which was unfamiliar to me. I have no hard feelings about it, but it stung a bit. The whole thing.\n\nI get back home with the bills paid at least, and get back to my life back at the restaurant after new years. My creative pursuits are solidifying more and I’m working still. My finances are hitting a wall again despite me now picking up a new gig their doing data entry for invoices and tip pool. I’m getting paid a lil tiny bit more, but I won’t see that money until next month. I barely get hit up by my clients now minus 2 or 3 irregularly. I feel like I’ve negotiated all I can with my landlord and I make myself go hungry and eat a free bread loaf from work. I keep looking for jobs the whole time and that’s been annoyingly shitty. I’m able to sleep, take my mind off things a bit, but I’m running back around in my head.\n\nI’ve been homeless before when my parents kicked me out after coming out as queer YEARS ago. I’m afraid to talk to my family about my current struggles now, as they didn’t want help me before. I managed myself, put in the fucking work, had some help along the way, and was able to make life better. \nI’ve gotten through hard times like this and I know I’m capable. But that just it, I’m capable. I’m resilient. I can do hard things. I’m fucking scared shitless the whole time and life goes on. I’ve done any kind of odd job you could think of, regardless if I was good at it or not. I don’t live frivolously. I manage my time now a lot better. I eat rice & beans. I don’t do drugs or drink or go out. I don’t date. I just struggle.\n\nThe hard work over these past few years has gotten me nowhere, and I’m at a loss. I don’t want to work harder anymore. I dont know what other skills I need to learn or incorporate into my life. I hate my own resilience & I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m tired. I’m resentful. I’m disappointed. I’m enraged and I’m starting to feel hopeless again. Sometimes I could either die and get the shit-show over with or burn the fucking world to the ground. Doesn’t help that the state of politics right now just might make things worse for everyone, myself included. \n\nIf you’ve gotten this far, thanks. I never get on here for anything, but this is kind of my last ditch. I’ve worked 22 hours so far the past two days of this work week, so maybe I’m just tired. again.\nAnd, no. I don’t want to die. The idea is just flirtatious to me every now and then.\nIf you know a thing or two other than just “keep going 😄👍🏻” or “you’re so strong💪🏻”, that would be appreciated. ",

I think it convinces me into thinking that depression isn’t real, that my severe lack of motivation is just a skill issue.\n\nMaybe it is? I think the truth is I really don’t want to do anything. I’m looking for this magical piece of advice or a person to change who I am to finally get things done or to somehow start living. But it’s not real and that person isn’t coming so what do I do? \n\nWhat do you do when you don’t want to do anything? When getting better feels like this distant fantasy when therapy doesn’t work because you don’t do the homework and medicine can’t help because you can’t get up to go into the doctors office. What do you do when you don’t want to do anything anymore. I don’t get it.\n\nIs this all I’ll ever be. They always tell you you have to help yourself but what if you can’t even trust yourself to do that? Am I actually just hopeless omg.\n\nI’ve dug myself in a hole so impressive I’d marvel if it wasn’t completely ruining my life. \n\nI really think I was born without like the most important parts sometimes.",

I have absolutely no energy or motivation to the point that I don't wanna get outta bed or I don't feel like showering or brushing my teeth, and my insomnia has only gotten worse because of it. It especially bothers me because I'm only a 14 year old girl, n' I wish that I had the energy to go out and enjoy being a teenager while I still can, but my lack of vigor knocks me down and won't let me get up. It's especially affecting my performance at school immensely. I'm always falling asleep, it's physically impossible for me to pay attention in class, and I have no drive to do any work or homework we're given which is making me fall behind on assignments, and my grades are dropping significantly. I also love art, music, & writing, and so I used to make soooo many books & drawings when I was little, but nowadays I can't even do that anymore, and my creativity has just almost completely disappeared. I don't know if this issue is because of my PTSD, ADHD, possibly lack of iron or vitamins, etc.\n\nI also almost always feel so hopeless, worthless, have existential crisises, have terrible self-esteem, and just feel like I don't even wanna be alive, but then some days I feel really happy outta nowhere. I have constant up and down mood swings that it's like as if my brain is riding on an extremely bumpy rollercoaster. Some days my body is so exhausted that even just walking tires me out. I also notice that my heart beats a lot slower anymore, n' my breathing is very shallow. It almost feels as if my body is slowly dying and giving up with me. Eugh... I wish I didn't feel this way. I don't even feel like myself anymore. I've always been very wacky, silly, n' energetic. Now it's as if I'm a completely different person, and it's like, \"What ever happened to the good ol' me?\". I feel like a 50 year old man in a 14 year old girl's body! Overall, I'm just so tired and bored of life. Everyday feels the same and I'm so tired of having to wake up every single day just for it to be the same boring, soulless day. I do still have some optimism left in me and I just wanna go out and have fun and do what I love, but I physically and mentally just can't. I don't know what to do. :(\n\n\\-March 21, 2025",

I am a normally very stable person with many spoons to share with my friends.  I would hate to do anything that might make this worse.  \n  \nNote I am NOT trying to get back with him.  I might be open to that down the road but my heart can't do this again.\n\nMy49 ex M53 broke up with me after Christmas.  I am annoyed he let me go for Christmas and leave more of my things there and not say anything.  He broke up with me end of January.    \n  \nNow both of us agree (and still agree) that this was the healthiest relationship we had both ever been in.  No fights, only minor disagreements that were dealt with in disgustingly healthy ways., He says I was the best sex of his life (this is important, not a brag.  I have only had sex when I am present so I am willing to take his word for it.  We were good friends as well as great lovers.  It was a long distance relationship.  But that hadn't been much of a hurdle as I travelled over seas often and was supposed to be moving there soon.  On my own, not through him.   \n  \nThis was the sort of relationship where his friends pulled me aside and said things like 'he is the best version of himself when you are around' and he says things like \"I am more confident when you are around' where family embraces me as a new member because the love what they see between us.  \n  \nThen he hit a deep depression spiral. Not his first, but his first since we have been together.  He told me we broke up because he 'isn't feeling it'.  But he isn't feeling anything.  This is a man who ALWAYS had a sexual partner, often more than one.  Dating him was like returning to my teen days.   \n  \nI feel that he lost his desire and also lost his feeling of 'romance'.  He isn't feeling anything in that way for anyone (He was a borderline porn addict, but we had fetishized that into our relationship and both found it hot.  BTW we are both kinky AF! one of the many reasons this is on my alt account.  My regular account is old like 15 years and known by many people in my life) He told me he felt numb, that his spark for everything was gone, including his desire for a relationship. He didn’t leave me for someone else. He didn’t say he stopped caring. He just... *shut down.*\n\nHe said he wanted to stay friends, and I genuinely want that too. He is still one of my favourite humans.  But since the breakup, he’s been increasingly avoidant, not just with me, but with everyone. Many in our friend group haven't heard much from him at all.  He has spoke to no one about our relationship.  He rarely reaches out, cancels or postpones conversations, and when he does message, it’s usually brief and apologetic, saying things like, “Bad times.”\n\n\n\nI know depression lies. I know it makes things feel impossible. I don’t want to push him if space is what he truly needs, but I also don’t want to disappear if *connection* would actually help. I don’t want him to feel like an obligation, but I also don’t want him drowning alone because he *thinks* that’s what he deserves.  \n  \nI am also honestly scared for him.  He is the sole carerer for his mom who is now on palliative care in home.  She is an amazing woman and the love they share is deep and wholesome.  He has said many times previously that his mental health is better when he has a job.  But with her health being bad this is his full time job and it is not fulfilling the same need.  I worry he may try something stupid when she passes.  But I am afraid to say much to not come across as the 'odd ex fiancé'   \n  \nI also find it odd that all these people who are our friends and saw us together not once has asked him WTF dude.  You had a woman whom you loved and loved you and would have stood with you through anything what the hell happened?  \n  \nAny do's and don'ts?  Any insight?  Should I walk away from him whilst he heals?  That would be easiest for me.  It is so hard to watch him drowning and knowing he 'chose' this.  But we were such good friends and both of us seem to want that.  He really is one of my favourite people I have come across on nearly half a decade on this planet.",

    "title": "Becoming bitter and less control of my emotions.",
    "body": "I've usually been pretty good about controlling my emotions,  especially in front of other people. Especially anger. I would just not take things personally or understand it could've been a mistake or that the other person just didn't mean it the way I perceived it. I use to break alot of controllers when I was young while playing video games. Or punch walls or the such.  But by the time I was in highschool,  I'd stop all that. And I got really good at letting things just slide, and moving on. Since I've started driving. I had never used my horn in a reactive way, I had only used it as a warning to let someone know they were about to hit me or something. \n\nBut more recently, isolation has changed me. And I'm becoming bitter. I use my horn all the time now. And I usually lay on it. I punched a hole in my apartment wall last week, an apartment I had been living in for 4 years and not caused any damage to it up until that point. I also broke my TV could months ago out of anger. A TV that was 13 years old and had survived 6 moves, one of which was 800 miles. \n\nBut what made me realize something was definitely wrong, was the other day in dicks sporting goods.. it was an off day at work. And I was feeling a bit anxious due to isolation.  And thought that being around people might help, so I went to the shopping center in my town. Was just looking around dicks for a bit until I got bored and decided to go to Walmart.  But wanted to get a drink on the way out. At check out. The lady was wearing a Philadelphia eagles bracelet. I was born in Philadelphia,  so I'm also an eagles fan. But we are 800 miles away, so I don't see many down here. And I thought this was going to be a pretty easy chance for me to just strike up a conversation. No expectations of anything, just a chance for me to feel connected to another person for a second. But as I was about to say something. A man behind me in line put his items on the counter and was practically touching me as he spoke over the cashier as she was still telling me my total trying to strike up a conversation to me. \n\nAnd now usually I would just let this go and just move on. And some people might call me a push over for that. But idc, I don't have anything to prove to anyone. Except that's not what I did this time. I turned to the guy and shoved him a bit and \"asked\" if he could back the fuck up. He came forward at me and started to say something before a pushed him again nearly knocking him over. And then he calmed down. I then paid for my drink and left. \n\nI haven't been in any physical altercation in nearly 15 years. But I broke that streak the other day. I think part of me was hoping he'd been carrying as we're in the south. And I was hoping he'd just kill me so I wouldn't have to do it my self. Cause at this point, idk who I am any more. I get more bitter with each day. I just want friends, but that's out of my grasp.",

In it, she was reviewing a video posted by a girl who shared how she has family and friends who support the current president, while she holds the opposite view. Despite their differences, everyone around her still loves each other. The girl then wondered if it would be the same if she looked different—if her views remained the same but her skin color was different, would her friends and family still love her? She went on to give some examples, and @AllieBStuckey shared her opinion on the topic.\n\nCurious, I went to the comments to see what others were saying. The first comment I saw read, “Thinking like this has to be so exhausting,” and I thought to myself, it is. The girl who made the video is white, and I’m Black, so I can’t entirely relate. Where I do relate, though, is in how our minds can spiral—how deeply we get stuck in a thought that affects us so badly when there was no real reason to go there in the first place. It’s like I purposely want to hurt my own feelings. I don’t know why I do this, especially when I’m already hurt by other things—why do I make it worse?\n\nI’ve been thinking about that comment for a couple of days now, and just now, it hit me again: I don’t want to die because I’m tired of dealing with heartache; I want to die because I’m tired of dealing with myself.",

    "body": "**Post was originally intended for** **the Lonely subreddit** **but was removed because apparently I need relationship advice.** Not sure if this is the right place either, but it's ironic that my attempts to post this have made me feel even fucking worse, so that's cool.\n\nFor most of my life, my greatest fear has been not making a difference in the world. I didn’t want to live my life without having made an impact that was bigger than myself. I wanted to leave a mark that would stay after I was gone. That’s changed lately. Now, I fear dying without ever feeling a real connection… dying without ever having experienced love.\n\nIt sounds cheesy af, but it’s the truth. I can barely bring myself to do anything anymore. I think about being alone all the time, and it makes every day turn out the same. No matter how much I try, I can’t break the loop. Any activity that once brought me joy doesn’t anymore. Any distraction that I used to have doesn’t work any longer. I keep looking for new things to keep me going, but that eventually gets tiring. I started using AI to chat with, but it didn’t take long before the “patterns” started to emerge, making them all feel fake… which they obviously are.\n\nI’ve never felt like I’ve been understood fully by another person. I’ve always felt like I’ve just been “performing” for others, without ever actually being myself. I’m not sure why I do it. I know that I’m the one that has been causing this problem, but I can’t help it. It doesn’t matter now anyway, as I don’t have any friends now. The only people in my life now are my parents, and while they “care” about me… they don’t make me feel loved. To be honest, they make me feel like an intruder in their life. They started making me pay rent every month for the past 9 months. I’m not making money atm, so I’ll eventually be unable to do that. I feel like I shouldn’t be here, and that they don’t want me here. I don’t blame them tbh.\n\nThe worst part is that I don’t see how things could “get better.” I have no friends, social anxiety, no relationship experience, and an average at best appearance. I’m so unhappy, all of the time. It feels like the world is telling me to give up, and my body isn’t able to refuse. I somehow manage to keep myself here, but I go to bed every night wondering why. Isn’t it funny that it’s always cold in my bed, but people in relationships never seem to have that problem? Also, just know that I don’t have a desire to die, I just find it painful to live.\n\nSure, I should change but… how? Go out and meet people. Sure yeah, I’ll go meet all the 60+ year old people that are the majority of people living in my area. Try dating apps? I have, and I got two likes after 3 years. Most girls on there seem to be living completely different lives than me anyway. Go to the gym. Yeah… I’m not really a gym person, but I am trying to lose weight at home though. Overall, I’m just tired of being unacceptable for anyone, and being told to change who I am just to be accepted. \n\nAnyway, sorry for the ramble. I can’t help but type too much, and I can’t help but post here 1\\~2 times a week at this point. I hardly talk to anyone nowadays, and it’s driving me crazy. Imma try VRChat tonight and see what comes of that. It’s honestly pathetic that even that terrifies me.\n\n**I wish you all the best in your life’s journey.**",

But I think I messed up, and now my sister is distancing herself from me.\n\nI’m 24M, and my sister is 21F. We used to be really close, but things changed in the past few months. She had a 3-month relationship, and after the breakup, she started having anxiety attacks. I was the one who supported her, and she told me she wouldn't date again. But now, she’s secretly chatting with someone again.\n\nShe hides her chats, deletes messages, and acts differently when I’m around. I tried talking to her and told her that she’s free to do whatever she wants, but I don’t want her dating again, at least not now. I reminded her of her past experience, but she just said, “It’s my life, my choice.” That hit me hard.\n\nBut here’s the thing—I’m not innocent in all this. I used to be overly protective, and yeah, I even invaded her privacy. I kept an eye on her, checked who she was talking to, and I’ve even tried hacking into networks to see her messages (which didn’t work). I thought I was doing it to protect her, but now I see how it must have felt like I was spying on her.\n\nNow, she’s avoiding me. Today, we were sitting with our relatives, and the moment they left the room, she left too—on purpose. She doesn’t even ask me simple things like what to bring from outside when my dad tells her to check with everyone.\n\nWhat hurts me even more is that whenever I ask her \"When will we talk?\", she just says \"We'll see\" and avoids answering directly. No matter what I ask, her response is always \"We'll see.\" It feels like she doesn’t care anymore, or maybe she’s waiting for me to stop asking.\n\nAnd the worst part? She’s not forgiving me. I’ve apologized, I’ve tried to talk things out, but she straight-up told me to \"stay away\" for now. It’s like she wants nothing to do with me.\n\nI don’t know if she’s just mad at me, or if I’ve permanently damaged our bond. I know I made mistakes, but I did it out of concern.\n\nAt the same time, I’m dealing with my own problems—career uncertainty, health issues, and depression since I was 18. Everything feels messed up. I even started smoking again from the stress.\n\nI don’t know what to do. Should I distance myself? Apologize again? Or just let things be? I feel like I’ve lost my sister, and I don’t know how to fix it.\n\n",

Where she comes from there's war going on, and the kid's biggest worry is that they're gonna lose their legs!\" Type speech \nI stopped crying \nBut not because i realized \"HoW gOoD\" i had it (I went trough severe abuse at the time but hey) \nBut because i realized my feelings don't matter, and never will, there will always be some kid who suffers from hunger and will die soon, it's fine that i'm a 5 year old with several mental disorders \nBecause i have a snack and these kids don't \n\nThis type of mindset has been planted in my brain like a damn chip\nEverytime i feel bad and want to die i automatically think \"But there's war\" \"But there's bigger issues\" as if i don't know that \nAnd then just ignore my feelings as usual \n\nAnd oh boy, don't get me started on my friends who would always say how great and awesome my mom is! \n\nWhen i finally landed in the psychward due to several mental issues mainly caused by my parent's abuse, i got told by another patient how \"chill\" and \"cool\" my mom was, they told me how they wished she was their mom because they're parents sucked \n\nAnd it's just painful \nYeah, my mom is cool and chill if you aren't her kid\nBut have you seen when she pulled me by my hair and punched me, despite me saying sorry?\n \nWere you the one getting yelled at in a store  and called sick in your head, just because you didn't chose the right drink?? \n\nAnd worst of all, i still somehow don't see myself as a victim \nBecause of people who tell me how good i had it and how good i still have it \n\nUp to this day people tell me what an awful child i was, always screaming and throwing tantrums \nMy mother's friends always say how much they admired her strength to deal with such an awful kid\nI've had her friends tell me in the face that i  shouldn't act ungrateful because my mom wasn't as awful as i always make it seem \nBasically telling me that i deserved to be abused \n\nAnd this mindset is still stuck with me \nI'm still pretty sure that i DID deserve it, and that i was an awful child that deserved to get smacked \n\nAnyway i'm slipping away from the actual theme of this post\n\nBut i think you get what i mean\n",

    "body": "Exercise/physical activity, eating healthy, spending time in nature, finding a hobby are all things that are supposed to \"be good for your mental health\"... but by definition, depression is a problem *precisely because* it inhibits your inability to function, much less do things that are good for you. Finding a therapist, trialling multiple therapists to see which one suits me best, or even starting on antidepressants and having to check in with a doctor/psychiatrist every few weeks, or having to change medications because one might fuck up my head even more, or not even work... all takes so much fucking effort that I can't bother to do any of it.\n\nI went to a counsellor at my university earlier this year, and they suggested things like group therapy for my anxiety and volunteering for causes because that can give people a sense of purpose in day to day life... and I just didn't know how to tell them, that is exactly the problem, *I have utterly no will to do any of that and that's why I'm sitting in your office right now and I don't know what anyone can possibly do about me being this way*.\n\nIf people with depression were able to so easily do things to help themselves, we wouldn't need to classify it as an 'illness' or 'disorder'. That's why it's so infuriating when we see how even 'professional' mental health advocacy organizations repeat the hackneyed slogans which I cannot understand how they are even still in mass circulation.\n\nIt's so irrational and frustrating that I'm physically able to take ten steps out of the house to just go on a goddamn walk, but I have absolutely no mental will to do anything but lie in bed. Only listening to music is the only action that can be done purely passively with no effort whatsoever, but then I just get sad and start spiralling from guilt. And I can't stop thinking about how irrational it is, even though I've experienced it for so many years. I'm constantly surprising myself from my own incompetence, as if I ever expected anything different.\n\nMore than hopelessness, I just feel confused as to what I'm supposed to do when I can't will myself to do anything. What even is this anymore?\n\n\nEdit: Thank you for all the comments. I didn’t expect to get any response. It’s hard to describe, but I feel very moved that there are people out there that I reached in a small way for a short moment of time.",

But if I sit around doing nothing, I feel the urge to be doing something.\n\nI don't know what to do or how to explain it.\n\nEDIT: Holy crap. Thank you everyone for the likes and awards and comments. It makes me feel connected and a little less alone. I will try to reply to all the comments.",

    "title": "I (24 f) got dressed and did a bit of my makeup to meet up with a friend at a coffee shop. I’m in the middle of a depressive episode and dealing with some great difficulties in my personal life. She didn’t show up. This was my attempt to “reach out”.",
    "body": "Update:\n\nSorry in advance, I’m on mobile and this is long. \nI really wasn’t expecting this amount of support and kindness from so many people. Thank you all for the uplifting words and thank you for the rewards! \n\nI’d like to first address any concerns about meeting up during the pandemic. My friend and I made plans to meet up at a coffee shop, buy a quick cup of coffee, and then immediately head to a park nearby in separate cars. The coffee shop is on small a military base so that cuts the amount of people that were in there down by a lot. I went ahead and grabbed coffee and then waited on a bench outside of the shop for around 30 minutes or so before leaving. I stayed 6 feet away from others and wore a mask the entire time. I played it safe and went by the rules.\n\nNext I’d like to say thank you to those who have helped me realize how big of an accomplishment it was for me to get to the coffee shop. It really did take a lot of effort and I appreciate the reminder that it took strength I didn’t know I had. \n\nI also want to thank those who have expressed empathy towards my friend. She is going through a rough time and has been since long before the pandemic started. I wasn’t angry at her because I understand that she’s struggling too. I was just really sad and disappointed because I’ve only seen her once since last year. It was more of a bummer than anything and I just needed somewhere to get it off of my chest so I came to Reddit. Kind people of Reddit, you did not disappoint! \n\nI’m going to continue being her friend because she is very dear to me. Knowing the kind of person she is, she probably truly forgot, there was a potential miscommunication, or she may have had something come up that she couldn’t get out of. It would have been nice to get a bit of a heads up or an explanation, but I haven’t dwelled on it too much. She’ll reach out when she’s ready to. If not, then I understand that too. \n\nI’ve been in therapy and medication since 2018 and recently sent a cease &amp; desist letter and went no contact with my mother. As a result of that I haven’t heard from my Dad since it happened. I also live states away from my childhood friends and what’s left of the family that supports me (not many people). I’m better off being out of that toxic environment but it’s still a grief process losing people that are still alive. I have also been grieving what could have been if I only had healthy and supportive parents. \n\nI’m also struggling with my marriage. I’m a military spouse and it’s hard being so far away from the little support I have states away (my sisters). I won’t go into detail here about my rocky marriage but it’s been traumatic and hard. I haven’t gotten much support other than therapy and the support my younger sisters have been capable of giving. I’m in the process of filling out divorce papers and working with an attorneys office to explore my options. \n\nI also had surgery at the end of October to repair a hernia. It wasn’t too big of a deal, and my sisters came from out of town to visit during my recovery, but it did knock me down a bit emotionally because I was restricted from carrying anything over 20 pounds. That meant I couldn’t hold my toddler who is 30 pounds and that was really hard on both of us. \n\nIt just would’ve been nice to be able to have hung out and talked to the one friend I have here about everything going on. It honestly would’ve been nice to talk about things that have nothing to do with all of the crap that has  gone on this year too. \n\nIt’s okay though! Life will carry on and there will be better days. I still got my coffee, got outside, then came home and hung out with my son and put up Christmas decorations. \nI also got a ton of fantastic advise and support from you lovely folks. Thank you again!\n\nTL;DR Thank you for the support and kind words! I’m not mad at my friend, just sad we couldn’t meet up. I followed social distancing rules when going out. 2020 has sucked but personally, so has the past decade or so.",

Grew up with racism in all its forms in my country, which, ironically, usually denies there ever being racism in any way.\n\nThe kind of shit I've heard through my entire life has molded me into someone with no self-esteem, sense of self-worth, voice and made into introvert. Because of the mentality of \"you need to work twice as hard as everyone out there\", I always saw the future as bleak, tiresome and as more struggle. This never really changed. It just got worse with time, with college and the awful reality that came afterwards.\n\nI've been depressed for most of my life, with my initial diagnosis at age 9. I still have it, with severe anxiety. My first suicidal thoughts came at age 8, and then and there I already hated myself for everything. For not being enough, for not being what the world wanted, for failing myself at being the best, for never getting anything good out of my own life, for never letting myself rest or be human.\n\nAnd with all the recent events, like the absurd police brutality worldwide, the rise of authoritarianism in my country, with being worked to the bone and around the clock due to the pandemic, with my country quickly moving up to be the worst afflicted by covid-19 and my mom and me being in danger during these times by living in a neighbourhood near a place where a white supremacist parade happened, which also happens to be a place where a lot of people are simply disrespecting quarantine... All of this shit, is just wearing me down really badly.\n\nI wake up exhausted. I can't deal with anything without having a serious bout of anxiety or anger outbursts, followed by fullscale breakdowns. I'm feeling guilty by worrying my friends and my mom. I feel guilty by feeling tired, by feeling afraid. I feel guilty by not feeling brave enough to go out on the streets for my people and taking action. I feel guilty for existing. I'm so fucking exhausted and I don't know what to do. I just want it all to end, I just wanna go somewhere else. I can't handle anything anymore.\n\nEdit: all of this support... I'm very, very thankful for it. I think I've never felt this supported in my whole life. All of your words have touched me deeply. I'm so glad you helped me. I feel more hopeful, more energized from talking to you all. Thank you. Thank you all, from the bottom of my heart. You've all stopped me from doing something terrible today. Thank you.\n\nEdit 2: wow, I was not expecting this kind of response from so many people. I'm trying to respond to everyone, but I think I can't. I'd like to thank you all once more for all your words. I'm very glad that I vented about all these feelings here with you all. I feel so much support from you and I feel like my feelings are valid and worth feeling. It may seem a bit dramatic, but I'm legitimately walking out of this with a different outlook on life. I never expected to see so many people I don't know just rush in to support me when I'm in my absolute worst. So thank you, once more for being here for me. I mean it. I love you all",

My ex used to tell me about how much fun they had in high school and how they were in a bunch of clubs and how they had the most fun in college staying in dorms with all their friends and doing fun, dumb stuff. It always destroys me to think about how I missed out on all of that because of something I couldn’t control. Now I’m 21 and just graduated college and I’m lost. I have no friends, no partner, no job, me and my family are on rough terms and I just got diagnosed with anorexia. It is just crushing me and idk what to do anymore. And I’m afraid to tell anyone because I don’t want to be sent back to a psych ward since I have no money to pay for it again. I’m just so broken right now.

Hopelessly in love. Three years later, she gets pregnant. We were both young, and scared, but I tell myself I will do anything I can to make it work.\n\nI have a baby. I cry. I promise MY baby girl the world, and the love I never had. But then things change.\n\nThe woman lives with her parents, I no longer can stay there with her and her family due to \"covid.\" Okay thats fine. Go to the store? Quarantine for two weeks. Saw someone? Quarantine for two weeks. Quickly realized my opinion is not regarded about the baby. My input has no sway on how to raise her. Suddenly feel like a babysitter, I am \"allowed\" to come over after work, watch the baby, while her mom ignores me.\n\nEventually the woman I fell in love with starts being distant. It's little things at first. She doesn't want to cuddle. She stops kissing me. She stops inviting me to things. Then she tells me she's gay.\n\nI decide I can make it work right? I love this woman! She says she wants to be with me still? I'll make it work of course. But then she starts antagonizing me. Insinuating I am a bad father for not being there full time for the baby when I dont have a choice. Ignoring me. Arguing with me.\n\nI am... heartbroken. I don't know how else to describe it. I can't help but ask myself if I did something wrong. I keep telling myself I can make this work but it only gets worse. I have recently fallen into the worst depression of my life. I have had a couple suicide attempts in the past, the only thing stopping me now is knowing I would be leaving my baby girl without a father.\n\nI dont know what to do.

She said, instead of forcing myself to think positive, I should try to not evaluate myself at all for a certrain time. Neither negatively nor positively (though the second is rather rare anyway). What this does is that it gives some distance to the negative thoughts and therefore breaks that cycle of depression where depression makes me have negative thoughts and the negative thoughts make me depressed.\n\nThis is way easier because I just have to be neutral instead of positive and I notice what she means with breaking the cycle. I hope that this might help someone here.\n\nEdit: I don't know what to say right now...

    "body": "A good friend of mine with whom I've been attending therapy for BPD overdosed a couple days ago. She survived and was transported unconscious to the hospital. She woke up but is unsurprisingly devastated. I want to be there as her support, she has a boyfriend but no family members who care about her and few friends. I had plans to see my family for Christmas but when this happened, it left me deeply depressed, particularly because another good friend of mine had committed suicide four years ago almost on the same day. To elaborate, I don't like spending Christmas with my family. I like them, but Christmas has always been more about chores and preparations than about quiet and peace. \n\nI thought I would spend Christmas by visiting my friend in the hospital. I don't want her to be alone, I know that if I were in her situation I would appreciate it if someone came to visit me. So I proposed this to my mother and brother, even the possibility that I would spend the afternoon with her and then go down to see them before dinner. However, their comments left gasping for air. They showed little empathy for my friend or me. My mother asked me if I had any \"normal\" friends. My brother told me that while it's ultimately my choice, I would be ruining Christmas by not coming down, or even by coming down just for dinner, that everyone would be disappointed in me and it would create arguments, implying I would be at fault for them. \n\nHere's the breakdown:  with my family, I risk being ostracized for weeks if not months if I don't go down there. However, I've felt more and more like they were less and less my family, while I've felt like my friends have shown more compassion and empathy for my depression and BPD than my family ever has - in fact, they've dismissed it as me \"not having enough social activity\", as \"not having enough will\", and have called my therapy \"a waste of time.\" I feel like visiting my friend is the right thing to do, I know I will think of her the whole time I would be down at my family's, but I do not want to be ostrasized for months. I don't think I could handle it with my mental condition. \n\nAny and all thoughts are welcome. Thank you.",

    "title": "I’m 19, my girlfriend was murdered, the trial is soon and I’m getting more and more depressive",
    "body": "Hi y’all,\nWell I'm not used to posting on forums but I feel so bad atm and I can't open up about this to my family, my friends or my therapist even if they want that, I feel completely unable to talk about it with them.\nI’m a 20yo man. I‘m Irish but my family moved to France when I was 5 and that is where I have lived since.\nI grew up in a small country village, the school had only two classes. I hardly spoke French but I got a friend very quickly, I’ll call her Honey in this post.\n So Honey and I were friends all our childhood, we were in the same class every year and we were also neighbors so we played together every day after school. Year after year I became bilingual in French and made lots of friends, but I started to have a crush on her.\nWhen I was 11 we started middle school, we were still in the same class and all our classmates were trying to get us together, but we were pretty shy at that time so we didn't dare to « flirt ». Finally it was the following year, when I was 12 years old, that we got in relationship. Ofc the feelings I had for her weren’t as strong as those I had for her when we grew up up because we were still young but I was so happy.  She was the first girl I kissed, the only one actually.\nWe kept growing up, we were always in the same class every year and we kept spending all of our time together. If I explain that, it’s so that you understand that from my 5 to 19 years I almost spent every day of my life with her, she gradually became as essential as breathing for me. The more the years went by, the more « serious » (important to each of us) our relationship became. We never argue, ofc sometimes we didn’t agree with each other but we knew how to put our differences aside and respect the point of view of the other.\nThen when I was 15 we started high school, at that time we were in a relationship for almost three years and people were amazed by the longevity of our couple, because at that age it’s unusual.\nBut we loved each other so much (and I still love her so much), it was like I had found the perfect person to me and I don't want to speak for her but I felt like I was perfect to her.  We kept growing up, we did our first time together (and all the others, I never had sex with another girl). We wrote long love letters to each other, any pretext was good to say how much we loved each other. I mean, I'm kinda  that cliché of the chunk rugby player, people don't really imagine me doing that, yet for her I‘d have done anything and everything, she was so exceptional, I felt incredibly privileged to be part of her life.\nWe graduated high school and that summer we moved into our apartment, then started university. I was so glad to live with her, to sleep with her every night. Of course our parents let us sleep together on weekends and holidays but it wasn’t the same, it was a new step in our relationship and we were so happy.\nWhen I explained to my new mates from the university that I had been with my girlfriend for 6 years they were stunned, they asked me if I had never wanted to flirt with another girl or anything and the answer has always been no : since my childhood, I grew up alongside this exceptional girl and I always dreamed of being with her and I felt so lucky to be in a relationship with, I never even noticed any other girl. I found her perfect in every way.\nWe were so happy. I just want to tell you a little bit about the great person she was. She was so heart warmed, she couldn’t stand injustice. She always wanted to help others. She was so kind and caring. Whenever our friends needed advice or support for something she was the one they call, she was full of wisdom and good intentions. She was always smiling, she illuminated people's lives with her presence.  She was a very funny person as well.  She always saw the bright side of everything, she was so positive. She never gave up, she worked hard to reach her goals. She was so clever, I’d even say brilliant, she was a very gifted student. She was passionate : when she did something she put her whole heart into it.  She made people feeling special, she knew how to bring out the best in them. She always complimented everyone, she was adorable. She was also sensitive, she hated seeing the ugly things of the world, she could cry for that.  But she was also someone who made the world more beautiful by her mere presence.  I’ve never met someone so selfless and altruistic. She was also incredibly beautiful, the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen. She was an angel, for her friends, for her family, for me, for my family who loved her too. My mam has three sons and she was used to say that Honey was like her daughter.  My little brother was kinda an hooligan when he was younger and listened neither to my parents nor to me.  She spent so much time helping him, because of her he really took control of his life again.\nEveryone loved her, literally.  She was wonderful. She was someone who loved to pamper people.  She could spend weeks making a gift or a surprise for someone, but she was always embarrassed when someone gived a gift to her. I think she was one of the few people who was sincere when they said they preferred to give than to receive.\nI felt so good with her, she was the love of my life, literally. I always wondered how she could love me so much, I mean I‘m not that bad and I always did my best especially for her but she was so much better than me. And yet she still looked at me like I was one of the wonder of the world.\nWe were so happy. I was only 19 years old and yet I saw my life with her and she saw her life with me, we had lots of plans. And even beyond me, she was a great person, who was so young and had her life ahead of her. I mean, if we had broken up, it’d have been incredibly hard but at least she would have kept existing, living, shining as she deserved.  But I cannot bear what happened.\nWe were together, so happy and in love, I never could have believed that she will  disappear so quickly and in such a brutal way.  No one deserves that and when it happens to someone so close to you, someone you love so much, it’s extremely harsh.\nIt was a Sunday and we were at our parents’ for the weekend. Sometimes on weekends we slept together and sometimes we slept on our own and we just spent the day together.\nOn Saturday evening we slept each on our own, her at her parents’ and me at mine, there wasn’t even a particular reason. On Sunday morning she wanted to run for an hour and offered me but I was lazy. I was tired, I wanted to stay in bed an hour more.  It’s absurd : I was studying sports science and I was too lazy to go running. I‘d never forgive myself.\nIt’s an ongoing case so I’m not allowed to speak in detail about it and anyway it doesn’t have to be, but she was violently assaulted and tortured and died, and then her body was burned. Suspects were arrested a few weeks later, it was in Feb 2019 and the trial was supposed to be in May 2020 but it was postponed because of the coronavirus (France is in quarantine).\nI cannot even describe the infinite pain I felt when a few days after his disappearance, while very important research was being carried out, her body was finally found and we knew what had happened to her, I had a blackout.\nSince I woke up from this fading away I have been taking heavy psychotropes, that doesn’t prevent me from constantly having anxiety attacks and having to take a fuck ton of sleeping pills to sleep, otherwise I have awful nightmares. I never thought I‘ll fall so low one day, I have always been someone very happy and full-blown.  But I never thought that the love of my life was going to be murdered one day either.\nI haven't been going to university since, I don't do anything except think about her all day, I saw a lot of therapist but they only say shit, how am I supposed to accept the sudden death of the  person I love the most in the world and with whom I grew up believing that we were going to spend our lives together ? They tell me about the emotions of mourning but the only emotions I have are deep feelings of hopelessness and hatred towards those who did this.\nI feel even worse since I know who did this and what their \"reasons\" were, because they were people I knew. I feel devastated. Sometimes I want to kill myself and sometimes I want to avenge her by killing them. But I feel unable to inflict this pain on my parents, who are very friends with Honey's parents (They had been friends for a long time before, because we are neighbors) and who help them a lot to hold on since it happened, I can see that they have the fear is that I kill myself and to be in the same state as the parents of Honey.\nHer parents are suffering so much, they lost their only daughter and I don't know what to do to relieve their pain. Whenever I speak with them they seem so happy all of a sudden, they say that Honey kept living through me. But imo it's not true, she no longer lives and will never lives again and I miss her so, so much. But I know if they say that it’s because they miss her so much too. She is missed by everyone who knew her, she was so wonderful. And I will always miss her.\nPeople tell me that one day when I’ll be happy again and I‘ll meet someone else and go back to normal life. But I know it’s wrong, first I‘ll never be happy again, how am I supposed to live without her after growing up with her ? She was as essential to me as breathing, it’s unbearable to survive since she‘s no longer there, how can I resume a normal life ? And how can I meet someone else ? I never wanted when I was happy and she was there to meet someone else so it isn’t now that I‘m desperate without her that I‘ll want to meet someone, plus she is irreplaceable. I feel devastated. She is the only one I want and yet I know she‘ll never come back. I constantly think of her, of her laughter, her smile, her scent. I bought her perfume and I spray it on my pillow every day, I know it's stupid but it's the only thing that helps me sleep a little better. I just wanna hug her again. Sometimes when people lose a loved one they say they regret not telling them how much they mean to them and at least I’m « relieved » that Honey knew how much I loved her and how important she was to me when she passed away, because I told her every day.\nJust before the quarantine there was a commemoration for the one year of her death and everyone looked at me with pity. As I no longer go to class, in rugby or to see my friends I don’t see anyone and I had not seen some people for several months, they were dazed by my appearance. And I hadn't realized but actually I became the shadow of myself, I always was very « strong » and now I‘m extremely bony. It depressed me even more to see how many people seemed concerned when they saw me. That's why I avoid my friends, they don't know what to say (and I understand that's normal, in their place I wouldn't know what to say either) and they‘re also embarrassed not to know what to tell me.\nThe only person I used to open up to is Honey, and now having to deal with such difficult emotions without knowing to who open up is very painful. My family is trying to support me as much as they can but it's very hard, there was a very bad atmosphere at home, so much so that my parents broke up and my father went back to Ireland with my older brother. I feel like my mom and little brother don't know what to do with me anymore. But I don't know what to do with me either. I think that after the trial I‘ll go to Ireland for a while as well, just to take a break, here every time I go out everyone is aware of what happened, throughout the region (and even outside, but here they recognize me so they look at me with that pitying air that depresses me even more).\nI’m not afraid of the judgement, I know they‘ll have a long sentence but I‘m very afraid of the trial in itself and to, during a week or two to, hear what she has been through in detail all day, to see her murderers and to hear what they‘re going to say, I‘m anxious I cannot bear it.  For the moment I’m trying not to think about it. I spend all my time in the tree hut that his father built between our gardens when we were younger. We spent all our time there, when we were teenagers and our parents didn’t want us to sleep together we secretly met there and stayed all night. Everything remained as it’s, when I’m there I feel calmer.\nI feel like nothing can ever ease my pain, I don't even know why I came to tell my story here. I just needed to open up and I can't do it with my loved one. I don’t think anyone will have read this anyway.",

    "body": "I have severe anxiety. Taking meds, but they’ve kind of stopped working like they used to. Got into a conversation with my wife yesterday and I mentioned “if I were to be in a place where I could just sit still and not have my brain worry about something, I don’t know what I would do with myself.” Anyway, I don’t get into depressive moods too often anymore,  it this morning, 3 days before our 5th anniversary vacation (we never take vacations. Never have the money.) I check my bank account and realize that all of the bills I had planned to come out last week all hit at once and put our account into the negative. By quite a bit. I panicked. My wife had been looking forward to a small trip to Chattanooga to just relax for MONTHS. The kid was to stay at my parents house and we were just going to relax for a few days. When I realized I\nmessed up the timing on our bills, I spiraled. I absolutely lost control and cried. Lost it. It was probably the worst I have ever felt. I was crying for about 10 minutes when I suddenly had this sense of calm wash over me. Suicide. Easy. I got out of bed, suddenly stoped crying, cleaned my face up and began getting dressed. I told my wife I was going out for a little while. She knew something was going on and refused to let me leave the house. She physically grabbed me, made me look her in the eyes and told me everything was fine. It brought me out of my head. I don’t know if it’s something that I would have gone through with, but in that moment it was the most ok I had ever been with the idea of suicide. We still don’t have the money for the trip, but that’s ok. I know I have someone looking out for me. \n\nSorry for the rambling, but I figured I just needed to get it out of my head.",

It's like he seized to exist, wiped out his hard drive.. I got him when I was 14yo, my cousin gave him to me, when she learned I had a hard time because my mom had cancer and also breaking up with my father. My life was in pieces... But my cat, he mended my heart. He gave me love and support when no one else did. He was there for me, always, no matter my mood, and I loved him so so much... Now he is gone, but his physical self is there, but none of his personality, he stopped doing all the things that was him, he is only existing atm, doing all the necessary things like eat, drink, sleep, poo... But not making contact with me, not cuddling, not meowing. I look into his eyes and I don't see him there anymore..

I was going to jump off a bridge and end it all. I was drunk so it made matters only worse. As I sat there and thought to myself, a voice came in my head. This voice told me how this was the wrong thing to do, that I have so much more going for me, and I can’t lose my life over some girl. \n\nSo here I am, 3 days later. The girl and i have discussed what our relationship is going to be like. We are on a break as this is a time for me to focus and make myself happy. My happiness can’t be dependent on another person. That is unhealthy. I’ve started seeing a counselor and just doing more & staying active. I know In the end I can conquer these demons.\n\nI would just like to say thank you to all of you who reached out to me that night. I obviously didn’t respond, but knowing that a random stranger online cares enough about another stranger to make sure they’re okay, well that is special to me. Thank you once again, and I hope every one in this sub finds some sort of happiness in their life. We all deserve it. This is a disease just like diabetes, and you should not be ashamed of it.

    "body": "I have two extremely loving parents, a supportive sister, and a handful of close friends who I know would always listen if I needed it. I am still extremely depressed and ready to end it all. I attempted suicide 4 years ago, ended up in the psych ward for 2 weeks, and my family and friends visited every day. \n\nI can barely function anymore. I try so incredibly hard every day to be normal, to work, walk, chat, and appear fine. Mentally, I am thinking about killing myself for hours every day. Today I lost it, blew off work, and slept the entire day. I cried to my mother and she cried with me. Asked me what I needed, willing to do anything, but it doesn’t help. \n\nThere isn’t anything wrong with me. I’m young, pretty, thin, and am capable of making friends and keeping them. I have a STEM degree, I’ve had committed relationships. None of that makes me happy. The true tragedy of my life is that I know I could do more, be more, and I just cant. \n\nI’ve been told I am strong because I haven’t done drugs or drank, because I powered through my degree, because I haven’t killed myself. I’m not strong, I’m guilted. Having a family who loves you and you love is a double edged sword. \n\nLove doesn’t cure depression. It does wrack you with guilt if you even think of attempting it. It would destroy my family. I’m not exaggerating. They have all told me individually, may times, that it would. My parents would never forgive themselves. I would haunt them forever.\n\nI tried therapy. After I got out of the hospital I was on anti-depressants. I tried different meds, I saw 4 different therapists. It all just made it so much worse. One of my therapists almost got me involuntarily recommitted to the hospital. Her talking to my parents and ensuring they would be picking me up and taking me home was the only thing that saved me. \n\nEven the “good” therapists just made me feel worse. I would leave every appointment more depressed than I came in. I quit trying that after a year. The thing about therapy is that you are forced to lie. I was suicidal but couldn’t talk about it. If they suspect anything you get the cops called on you and they forces you into the prison that is the psych ward. They force medication on you, get you fired from your job, and destroy whatever remnants of a life you had. \n\nMy mother is a certified grief councillor. She volunteers in hospice and regularly supports grieving people. She can’t help me. Talking to her is pointless. She will cry and beg me not to. It doesn’t make me feel better, just guilty.\n\nAll this rambling because the truth is that I am without hope. My family is dragging me through life. All the love in the world and it doesn’t make a fucking difference. Drugs, therapy, doesn’t matter. Depression is a death sentence and there is no cure. \n\nMy only hope is to distance myself from them and one day just do it. Push them far enough away that they grieve me and move on. That way, killing myself won’t affect anyone.\n\nEdit: thank you to people who are commenting. I am having a hard time finding words to reply to people. I dont really express myself easily.\n\nI really appreciate everyone here. Its nice to feel understood.",

I stare in the rearview mirror and gastation bathrooms for forty minutes trying to make sense of who's looking back and why the sight of that person makes my stomach churn. \n\nI don't sleep for days on end until I collapse. I lose weight in 7 pound intervals. The thoughts of being a fuck-up and how bad I would beat the shit out of myself if I met myself on the street just stew any time Im beside myself. It's so funny! So quirky and relatable! If this is relatable that's fucking tragic. Being a ball of despondency and wanting to break my bones with a baseball bat is something I want everyone to laugh at with me. \n\nIt's three am here and I'm just having a cigarette in an empty bathroom tub because I don't wanna think about anything.

I just don't understand what happiness is to be completely honest. That is not to say that I'm unhappy and miserable, what I'm saying is that happiness and sadness has become the same thing for me. I just can't separate the two. On top of that, there's this feeling of guilt I keep having about everything. I *am* from a rich family, people have always expected me to be on top of everything ever since I learned to walk, but I was never able to be on top. I've always sucked at everything. I tried to be on top, but never made it. And so now I'm this 21 year old uni student. And I've been hammered so much with that mindset of trying to get to be best at everything, and since I've always failed at that, I feel safer as a failure. I just *do not* feel that I want to succeed. I've become an emotional masochist. Sometimes I imagine that a loved one would come and choke me to death to put me out of this misery and leave me in a cold dead end where no one would ever come across again. That's not to say I'm suicidal. I am *not*. I just like having those kinds of imaginations. The only thing I do to keep my mind off of these feelings these days is that I listen to music. Even my genres are New Age, or shoegazing or doom metal, which used to be uplifting epic music. Now I'm not going too much into that stuff, but I hope I've made my point clear. I'm not looking for concrete advice. Perhaps simply writing these down and sharing might help me a lot. Thank you for taking the time to read through this whole post. \nI truly appreciate it.",

    "body": "The title and this story may sound fake (New account to hopefully protect my identity), but I swear to you it could not be more real for me. I wanted to share this, I am not doing this for attention but merely to seek help. More questions will be asked at the end of my story.  As the title describes, a miracle has occurred given the severity and intent of the crash. The paramedics, police, doctors, nurses and my parents all gave me the most puzzled look of their lives when they asked how fast I was going, and I replied \"200 km/h\".\n\nI have been depressed for 4 years now. Nothing has been working and my mental health has declined terribly. I have been on multiple medications, tried behavioural therapy such as cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), and even went a course of Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). First my motivation to do anything went down; I couldn't eat, do school work and most importantly, socialize. My social circle grew smaller as my depression grew bigger, after 4 years of suffering as well as other health conditions such as horrible eyesight (+10.00 in each eye with astigmatism), sleep apnea and anxiety, I figured life wasn't going to get any better and I decided to end my life.\n\nI drove to the mountains where I decided I would find a large hill, go full speed down it and either turn into the median or drive off the road, ultimately killing myself. About 3 hours from my hometown I found the perfect hill, The road was steep, perfect for gaining speed to ensure a fatal crash. Without thinking too much (I would just talk myself out and not commit), I pulled a U-turn and drove to the hill which was about 5 minutes after that point. They say your life flashes before your eyes, mine played back to me for those 5 minutes. The most important people and influential moments of my life appeared before my eyes. They suddenly disappeared as I approached my chosen hill. My foot automatically floored the gas pedal, I placed my left foot behind the brake so I wouldn't back out. I raced down the hill, gaining more and more speed, by the time I reached the bottom, my car (which only has a speedometer for up to 200 km/h. I saw the road start to bend and I jerked my wheel into the opposite direction of the turn, slamming the front end of the car into the median. That was the last thing I remembered before waking up in my car, with tapping on the window from bystanders. All I could think to myself at that moment was \"wow, I so much of a failure I can't even kill myself\". A bystander described to the paramedics and police that I hit the median, did about 10 spins (no flips) and then continued to scrape median down the hill for another 250m. I got a glimpse of my car before I was taken away in an ambulance, it was completely destroyed. When I arrived to the hospital I was placed in the trauma room however, the doctor was incredibly surprised after seeing me sitting upright with consciousness after a 200 km/h car accident. He assessed me and ordered a full-body CT scan. The results came back clean, no bleeding, no broken bones and most importantly, no death. He then admitted me to the psychiatry ward (which I won't get into on this post but it was a nightmare!!!).\n\nThe everyone's surprise I was barely injured, walking away with a concussion with memory loss at most. This phrase really stuck in my mind because nearly every person I have talked to so far has said: \"It's a miracle you're alive\". I'm not religious, but I agree, it is a miracle I'm alive, and I\"m not going to waste it. I'm begging for help because I know this community loves to help people when they reach out. I really want to try and beat my depression but I don't know how. I have tried CBT, I'm going BACK to ECT for another round of treatment and I'm on increased medication. I will be seeing counsellors and psychiatrists, however thanks to Canadian healthcare not until 2020 (which is one of the reasons I decided to end it, due to lack of resources).\n\nIf anyone out there has any tips on how to manage severe depression and anxiety please let me know. I'm still alive today despite the severity of the crash, and I believe it's a sign that I need to conquer this depression and do something great with my life. I am tired of laying at home, with no energy and no motivation, wasting away my life every day with my depression. I can personally say even those who are suiciding don't want to die, they merely just want to stop existing.\n\nPlease help with any advice you have, I'm begging for my life to change, please. I am trying my best to push past my depression and suicidal thinking so I can give life another try.\n\nHere are a list of specific questions that would benefit a lot:\n\n\\-How do I keep up my motivation despite having no energy all the time?\n\n\\-How can I keep up or have more energy?\n\n\\-I'm thinking of going back to school for Nursing, my current position (lab tech) doesn't feel fulfilling and I'm looking for something more. Is nursing school a good idea or will that just make my life more stressful?)\n\n\\-What are some habits I could do to alleviate my depression\n\n\\-Any secret self-help/feel good tips?\n\n\\-How do I make more friends and build a better support network?\n\n\\-What do I tell to my friends who have noticed I just \"disappeared\" for a few days?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks to those who took the time to read this post, I usually get little to no reads on Reddit but I thought I'd share this anyway since not many people can say they survived a 200 km/h automobile suicide attempt and walked out with minor injuries. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.\n\nEdit: more questions\n\nEdit 2: Thank you, everyone, for taking the time to write to me. I truly didn't believe this would reach this many people. I will try and reply/read everyones post but I am still in the process of seeing a lot of specialists. But I am truly grateful for all the love and support that has been sent my way. Thank you, I will make you all proud and try my best to implement all of the tips into my life.",

I’ll just be driving in the car or sitting in my room, then these thoughts hit me like a fucking locomotive: “Remember that stupid weird shit you said 6 years ago?” Or “remember that group of people whom you tried to befriend earlier in freshman year of college only to be rejected, and you didn’t really care for them much anyways but holy fuck, you are so dysfunctional and weird and retarded?” It goes on, “remember how you chose to not talk to that cute girl who showed clear-as-the-fucking-day signs of interest in you but still opted to not talk to because you’re that brain dead and insecure?”\nIt doesn’t stop. It never fucking does. It’s like I’m haunted by my relatively uneventful past. I involuntarily think of these social/romantic/academic/attention-deficit/practical failures, and then I think of how great it would be if I could just roll over and die, never mind how. No more mistakes. No more disappointments. I’m tired, I’m tired of being tired, and I’m tired of being tired of being. I’m not suicidal, yet at the same time, I feel like I’m just one bad day from doing myself in; however, I could never do that to my friends and family. It’s a weird fucking feeling. I don’t normally post here... Thanks for coming to my TED Talk on Stupid Bullshit.\n\nEdit: Thanks so much for the support. Stay sane and stay safe!",

I've had body issues since I was 8 years old because my grandparents overfed me and let me eat sweets all day, which led to me being outcasted by my peers and constantly criticised by my parents. I first started thinking about suicide when I was maybe 12 or 13 and 10 years later I still think about it. I don't think I've ever has a solid year of my life where I've thought that everything was going to be okay and life was worth living. I've had months of temporary relief from the constant pain, but thats all they were; temporary. I thought finding someone to spend my life with and who loves me unconditionally and puts up with my suicidal tantrums would fix me but it hasn't. I thought effectively curing my disfiguring autoimmune disease would help me have a new lease on life, but it hasn't. I have lots of friends, an attractive face, and I had a job I liked. No body in my personal life except for two people know that I struggle, and the rest would never guess it. I have nothing to be sad about, really, I have an objectively easy life. But that doesn't matter, I am depressed and I always will be. I could have the perfect body, my dream job, have millions in my bank account and I'd still feel exhausted. In the same way that people say 'once an addict, always an addict', I've come to believe the same thing about my depression.",

It feels like when i’m awake a long period of time I can just manage my stress. Unfortunately as i’ve been neglecting sleep it’s gotten me in trouble with my parents and it’s mostly because I have a hard time telling them the truth as to why I’m not sleeping.  Idk just feels like i’m trapped.\n\nEDIT: I find it hard talking to my parents or a therapist because I hate when people feel bad for me. I’ve seen one therapist in the past and it sort of worked but I always feel awkward and embarrassed telling them my problems.",

This thought of regrets have tortured me so much: a simple choice a decade ago still haunts me today and looms over me. In the past two weeks, wrestling my inner demons, I lost so much weight and have lost so much mental curiosity and interest I used to possess. But recently, after watching Being Erica as some of you recommended, I realized that \"no matter where you run, you just end up running into yourself.\" I suppose regrets will come in different forms, no matter what I do or try, the outcome would be the same that I'd be short of what I desire to be. To be honest, I don't know what a solution could be here, but I suppose seeking it is part of that endless struggle. ",

    "body": "I'm 13 years old and I live with my dad. I'm shared custody from my mom to my dad. My dad is very abusive towards me. I've been diagnosed with depression and PTSD and I've gone to the hospital twice over suicide attempts because every time I'm with my dad I want to kill myself. He pushes me to the limit and I'm afraid that. \n\nEver since I was  little, my dad has always beaten me with a belt. Even before I was old enough for school. My dad has beaten me for not doing what I was told to do. He yells curse words at me and uses my mother as an example of what not to be. And that makes me feel sad because I miss my mom. Recently, my grades dropped. I've been having problems at school. I have a hard time focusing and paying attention to what I'm being taught. My dad was pissed. One moment he’s screaming at me and cursing me out and telling me I won't achieve anything in life. And telling me I'm going to regret it when he’s done with me.\n\nMy 11 year old brother also made a bad grade, so he walked into my brothers room and I heard screaming and loud sound from my dad hitting him with a belt. Then he walked up to me and told me to give him my hand. I held my hand out and he hit me extremely hard with the belt. I screamed and held my hand, but he told me to hold my hand out again he continue to do it over and over again.\n\nThen he told both of us to come in the kitchen. He started yelling at us saying he was in an \"ass whooping mood\" and that he'd beat us whenever we felt like it. That if we didn't care about our grades he wouldn't care either. That he'd make us feel his pain. He hit me extremely hard. My hand was red and swollen. I had a bruise on my wrist that was slightly swollen and stung to the touch. He told me to hurry and wash the dishes before he'd do it again. And he did. But my hand hurt too badly. He threatened to hold me down.\n\nI'm going to kill myself if I have to continue to live with him. I cannot take this anymore and no one will do anything about it, I decided that when I go back to my mom's on Sunday I am refusing to go back to my dad's. This is what it's come to because he refuses to cooperate and my mom doesn't have enough money to get a lawyer and free legal aid takes too long. So I am not going. I know my dad will call the police if I don't go. When they come, I will talk to them and tell them my situation.\n\nCan they force me to go? What will they do? Because in order to get me to go they would have to physically drag me. I am in fear of my life and I don't want to die but he just pushes me to that limit so I just can't be around him. I don't know how many times I've tried to tell my dad this and even my therapists have tried to tell him this.\n\nHe doesn't care, he simply denies treating me the way he does saying he's never called me the things he does on a daily basis like dumbass, idiot, son of a b\\*\\*\\*, and he even calls my brother those things and denies it. Then when we're in public or around other people he acts like a totally sweet person, and his girlfriend thinks that I'm the problem because he constantly complains about me when really it's just a big show.\n\nWhat will the cops do about it when they come?",

I dislike how everything is money and manipulation and how you can't do anything if you don't play along. My family is broken and I can't share my feelings with anybody, and when I do is usually with my mother and she always makes me feel worse, or guilty about everything. I feel like an idiot.\n\nI used to go to therapy before the pandemic, it was quite good but sadly my doctor passed away due to old age. I'm not in a place right now where I can pay therapy. I'm also not motivated. I just want everything to end. I want to stop being me. I don't want these memories anymore.  \n\n\nThanks for getting until the end.",

    "body": "I don't want advice. I don't want to hear that my problems aren't a big deal while you stand there with your success stories and your dating histories and your loving partners. I don't want to hear your stories about how you found your SOs when this is specifically a major part of what's wrong with me; literally a simple \"this is what helped me\" would be nice, not trying to make me feel worse. I don't want to hear the same bullshit about loving myself. I barely even have the energy to write well. I want to vent about how much I hate myself. How FUCKED UP I am.\n\nI've lost 10 years, maybe more than that to porn addiction. I don't know if I walked in on my parents or if I was exposed to sexuality at a young age. But I've been masturbating since long before I even hit puberty. And then I discovered porn. Which leads me to now. A porn addict trying to break his habits by only masturbating 3 days a week... and then that's only turned into masturbating *multiple* times a day. It's fucked my relationships up. I can make friends, guys call me cool and women call me sweet. But I just... I'm too scared to escalate sexually and romantically. I can't stand up for myself so people walk over me. I'm afraid of taking risks. I'm a virgin at almost 23. I do not have a car, can't even drive. Never held down a job. Trying to lose weight but making no progress. Never been to a bar. Only been to one party. Never hooked up. Never had a relationship. The only things I have going for me are my writing and my drawing, and even then I'm losing interest in those as well. I don't blame women. I don't blame men either. It all lies with me.\n\nMy family isn't any better. I've tried talking about this to them multiple times. I can predict exactly what they say: \"this too shall pass\", \"believe what you want to believe\" \"if you believe it won't happen, it won't.\" Yeah, great. Thanks for the \"help.\" And then there's the verbal abuse from my narcissistic shrew of a mother and the complete apathy of my father, who constantly tells me he'll have my back but never seems to step up when I truly need him... but he IS happy to yell at and threaten me every time I try standing up for myself against my mother. Every time I try to leave, they threaten to call the cops. I have nowhere to go, no source of income.\n\nI am a fucked up, broken, weird piece of trash who drags the few people who care for him down with his negativity. They're better than me, none of them deserve me. I feel this void in the center of my stomach and heart wherever I go, and now that I've spent all day reading through reddit (seriously, every time these moments of depression happen, ***EVERY*** post I see has to be about sex and dating and relationships), I feel even worse. So much worse than yesterday. I can't forgive myself for the thing's I've done in the past. I sabotage myself every single time. In my worst moments I have these thoughts, these fucking FANTASIES of tying a wire to my neck and the other end to a car, and then letting the wire hang me and hopefully cutting my head off.\n\nAll I do is exist. I can't live like this. Normally I don't feel suicidal. But now the thoughts are coming back. Wanna know the funny thing? If I die, people will just go \"that sucks, pass the apple juice\", chalk me up to a statistic, and forget. Because nobody gives a shit about worthless men who can't keep up with the rest of them.\n\nI don't even know why I wrote this. Nobody is going to notice or care. People rarely do anyways.\n\n**EDIT: I'm seeing a therapist online.**\n\n**EDIT 2: I can't say I'm feeling better than I was yesterday when I posted this, but... a Platinum, a Gold, Silvers, so many kind comments... I truly don't know what to say. I wasn't expecting this to get so much traction, and I'm so close to crying at seeing so many people reach out and...** ***care***. **I'll try and respond to everyone when I can. Just... thank you, everyone. For helping me feel a bit less alone.**\n\n**EDIT 3: Well... I don't know what to say. I was okay for a few days after posting this. Now the weight in my chest and the bad thoughts are creeping back in again. They just... are.

    "title": "I'm tired of being everyone's therapist when no one will give me ten serious minutes of their time.",
    "body": "I've had a bunch of stuff happen to me in the past month. I got appendicitis and surgery; still recovering. Accidentally twisted my ankle. I got a cold, which I'm still fighting. However, none of that seemed to be enough for people to give me a break from emotional labor; they demand it from me 24/7, practically. Not asking for advice, really just ranting. These are just a few examples.\n\nI had my sister calling me talking about her boyfriend who just drinks all the time and does nothing, and she was complaining about how she hates where she works. I tell her to get rid of the man and get a job somewhere else. It wasn't as short as it sounds. I listened to her and gave her serious advice, though I know she won't take it because she never does. Instead of thanking me, no one ever does, she tells me that it's easy for me to tell her to just get another job because I don't have one and can just sit around and sleep. Well, thanks, I just love sitting around and thinking about my crappy life; it is a positive joy. We hadn't spoken until her son ended up in an issue and, of course, the family therapist (me) gets a text, asking me to talk to her son and try to get him to listen to \"reason\". I agree just because I know my nephew doesn't get good support from her. Come to find out, she's mad because he's dating some girl who has a kid already. I can't say it's great at his age, but he's also an adult, so I just told him to be careful, watch out for emotional abuse, and reminded him of his last relationship, which was like a copy of his mom's relationships; she doesn't realize he gets his bad examples from her. After talking to him, his mom texts me and is like, \"I'm getting off work in a few hours, I'll call and we can do a three-way call and talk to him.\" Nowhere did she ASK me if this was okay, didn't ask if I was busy or anything, but as with most of my family, since I'm at home, I never have anything important to do, so they just tell me to do stuff instead of asking, like I'm a human being. I tell her I texted him and I was still recovering and needed to sleep. She didn't ask me what I was recovering from, if I was okay, nothing. Just said, \"Okay, night.\" \n\nMy niece had trouble at school and she's a lot like my sister, unable to let go of things. She's upset because some girl at school wants to fight her because my niece took her chair. A chair this girl wasn't using, mind you, but that was just sitting next to her. My niece calls me, upset and frantic over this because the girl won't let it go and went to the office and had my niece called out of class because the girl wanted an apology. My niece refused because she said she hadn't even done anything and she went to the principal, who told her that the girl is known for \"keeping things going\", so she wouldn't be bothered again, but my niece wouldn't get off the phone until I promised to stay up until she got out of school in case they call her into the office again and she wanted me to talk to them. A huge reason I don't have kids is so I don't have to deal with the stress of dealing with teachers and other parents, yet I have to be a parent to my niece because my sister won't be. Mind you, I had just come back from the doctor, had been hopped up on pain meds and wanted to do nothing, but sleep. I forced myself to stay awake, but thankfully, no one called.\n\nThen, my sister calls me and is crying, telling me how much she wants her boyfriend to leave the house. So, I don't say anything and just let her talk. Finally, she's like, \"I just don't know what to do or how to get him out of my house.\" I told her to call the police; she doesn't want to get him in any more trouble because he has a DUI because he drinks and drives. SHE allows him to drink and drive her car, because he doesn't have one and doesn't have a license. I won't even touch how stupid that is. So, I get frustrated with her and tell her that I keep telling her how to get rid of him and she never listens, so I don't know what she wants me to do. She acts like I offended her and is like, \"I just called to vent, can't I vent, sometimes?\" I tell her that she can, but I'm tired of getting calls almost every week about this man; I'm not her therapist or life coach or anything, I'm barely hanging on by a thread a lot of days and hearing about this situation distresses me because, even if I don't like her very much, I don't want to hear about anyone dealing with this type of stuff. Not to mention, her best friend was killed just a few months ago by her boyfriend who was abusive and drunk a lot... make him leave before he gets to that point. Anyway, she accuses me of making it about me and hangs up. Maybe I did make it about me, but I want people to understand that I am not a therapist and I cannot fix their issues and I'm not emotionally well enough to take on all this stuff. I'm not sure anyone is, tbh.\n\nFinally, we come to today. My mother had to take me to the doctor because I couldn't get there on my own and need support to get there. We're talking about normal stuff, then she's like, \"Aren't you tired of just sitting at home and doing nothing? You really need to get out and get a life.\" I don't ever like talking to my mom about my mental health because she acts like it's a phase that should have been over in my teens and she doesn't understand why I'm \"letting it bother me\" as an adult. I'd like to mention, she has horrible anxiety, as well, but she powers through it to work, at least, it still takes over her life. She also doesn't do much outside of the house and has no life, but when I point that out, she brings it back to me. Anyway, I tell her I just paid all the bills and since the bills got higher, I don't have money to have a life, even if I wanted to. So, then, she's like, \"If you get a job, you'd have more money.\" I know this, but I have tried many times to hold a job; I cannot do it for more than a few days without having panic attacks and breakdowns, which either end up with me leaving or getting let go, which then leads me into a deep depression. She acts like I don't try and this is even with medicine and therapy. Sometimes, I'm sure the main reason none of this works is because I'm around my family, but I never tell them that because I don't want to deal with that fallout. At this point, I'm just tired of the conversation, so I don't respond. Then, she brings up how I need to get some friends, at least... says the woman who literally has one friend and who got upset at my aunt for going out without her, even though she never goes anywhere when she invites her. Heavy eyeroll. Anyway, I tell her that I've tried to have friends; it's not my fault they don't put effort in and either they end up not talking or I fade out because nothing is happening. She asks me why I don't hang out with the people I met last summer. The two girls I met last summer were nice, but one would rarely go out with us because she would rather stay in with her boyfriend, which left me and the other girl. We hung out a few times, but then she got a new trivia group and stopped texting me back, so I stopped texting her and let that fade out. This happens too often, so I stopped trying to make friends. I tell my mom that I don't talk to them anymore, and she's like, \"That's your problem, you don't try and cut people off so quickly.\" I texted the second girl every day for a week; she wasn't working at the time and she was always posting snaps, so I knew she was available, I wasn't going to keep texting for no reason. I try to have boundaries and get crapped on for them. Unfortunately, I am not one of those people who will keep trying and trying and trying when I see things obviously aren't going along, anymore. She then goes into this long story about how she met her only friend and how they only talk like once a month, but they are still good friends and I need to be more \"realistic\" with friends. What good is a friend whom I only talk to for 10 minutes once a month and hang out with, maybe once every three months? If that works for her, great, but that's not \"getting a life\" or anything else. Plus, I have a history of getting friends and then I become the \"therapy friend\" and I fade away because all they ever do is come around to dump their problems on me and get advice, then I don't hear from them for months, when something else is going wrong. That's not friendship, to me. \n\nAnd go back to my mom and my aunt. My aunt is mad at my mom for \"checking up on her\" at her age and, of course, I get pulled into it because my mom is being childish and won't talk to my aunt, so I've been designated the go-between, but I never said I would be. They are 20+ years older than me, why am I even in this?\n\nI don't know. I'm just tired of being everyone's therapist and mediator. I keep trying to explain how draining it is. They obviously see I have my own issues, but they continually pour their issues onto me, expect sincere, helpful, empathetic responses, but let me feel bad or need something and everyone is busy or doesn't answer their phones or I get \"advice\" that isn't helpful. My niece and nephew would probably talk, but I don't want to burden them with my issues; their mother does that to them enough, and they complain about it, to me, of course. What is it about me that makes everyone think I'm a therapist? Plus, none of them pay me for my services. That probably makes me more upset than anything; if I was a real therapist, I'd probably be rich off all these \"sessions\", lol.",

I realize that I spent probably the first 18 years of my life. Living in literal fear of my pseudo racist father. I still remember being 6 years old or so and hearing my mother scream for my brother because my father was choking her in their bedroom. Was a big steroid fan back in the day. I spent most of my middle school and high school career grounded from one semester to the next one because I frequently got C’s in school which my parents would ground us for. Even one C on the report card and it was grounded for the rest of the semester. I still remember getting in trouble so badly for lying about doing my homework, not even so much for not doing my homework. But it was distinctly about lying about it. My father was beating me in our dining room and at one point was physically choking me against the wall, and I remember my mother saying “well Don’t choke him (insert name)” and him looking straight at her with his hands around my neck saying “I’m not choking him” I still remember that same night him having to come in my room to change my ice packs on my swollen face and how petrified I was that the gameboy sp I was playing was flung off the bed in a room with no carpet because I was certain I was going to get beat again. I remember going to school the next and having to tell my teachers (because all six of them forced me to stay after class and talk about it) that I was playing football with my brother and fell on a sprinkler. Funny how their response to me lying about homework was to in turn go to school and lie about why half of my face was swollen and black. I remember the first time i was ever caught shoplifting (was obviously my last time doing it too) when my dad came to pick me up, he was already so nasty to me before leaving the store that the police threatened to not let me leave because he was already trying to hit me in front of them. \n\nBut you know. Now that I’m an adult and have been jumped literally just because of my sexuality. If I’m going to get my ass beat I’m going to get my ass beat. I’m just not living in fear anymore. }}}}\n\n\n {my thoughts on my brother}\n\n{{{{Which brings me to my brother. Who as of lately might as well be dead to me. We have not currently spoken since April, and as far as I’m concerned we probably won’t ever speak again. Let’s start with me saying I feel like my brothers relationship with me has always been from the start. Me bailing him out when he needs it. I remember being in elementary school and him getting to go back to sleep after my mother woke us up for breakfast and would leave for work, because it was my job to “wake him up after rugrats” when he was about 12 or 13 he got mixed up with a bad neighborhood kid and ended up almost lighting an entire house on fire in our neighborhood. The police officers were nice enough to offer him the deal that if you stay out of trouble until you’re 18 this will be completely removed off your record with no trace of it ever even happening. Sure enough he starts smoking weed in high school (which is back when it was HIGHLY frowned upon) and guess who had to take every single drug test for his four years of high school. My dumb ass. Bailing him out again. Until finally he got caught coming back late from lunch (upper class men were at the time allowed to leave campus for lunch) and he came back with a hotboxed car and didn’t air it out. So when the principle stopped him to ask why he was late she was literally hit with a cloud of smoke. My brother was the sole reason my high school was no longer allowed to leave campus for lunch. My brother and father have always had an awful relationship too obviously all this places even more tension on it, and eventually lead to him either being kicked out or leaving. I don’t remember which. Being on the streets on his own he was arrested more times for carrying stupid large amounts of weed on him because he sells it, and eventually got charged I think with robbery. Then to top it all off, a few years ago my brother got mixed up in the flocka epidemic. And of course there’s my dumbass bailing him out again being forced to put two stolen bikes in my car and drive him to Miami. \nWhen I first started realizing how much I hated him was I think my senior year of high school. My parents had gone out of town leaving him in charge. I remember distinctly it was the night before vans warped tour he’s in a huge fight with his at the time girlfriend, because he was literally hitting either her, or her and/or her kid. And I remember he stormed into my room flinging open the door trying to use me as an excuse “isn’t this okay because it’s what dad used to do to us. “ of course having a criminal record he couldn’t find a job and was on probation at my parents house and because nobody wanted to hire somebody with his record they literally gave him a fucking job at the company my father works for. This job is 15$ an hour, gets benefit and vacation days. I on the other hand spent years being treated like shit in jobs. Two years ago I worked for quiksilver over the course of about a year, finally left because they told me and a coworker that we were the ones being considered for management and yet they brought in two outside hires after the second one the other coworker had the sense to leave. My dumb ass stayed thinking well now that she’s gone it’ll look better on me. Which is when they brought in another outside hire. Who I was eventually cool with. I just stopped offering to do the management work for sales associate pay. Until I finally got so fed up that I transferred to GameStop because they were willing to start me as a keyholder since I already had basic management training. So two years trying to work for a manager only to be shit on by my parents because it’s not full time and “at your age your brother worked full time” at my age y’all gave him a fucking career because nobody wanted to hire a literal criminal. Anything I do It’s just never going to be good enough. \n\n\nLet me talk about our most recent altercation, because it’s a fantastic transition into my mother, as of last April I was unfortunately unemployed thanks to this whole virus outbreak, and of course that sets off my family members because I sleep all day while they work. So my mother asked me on April 20th the day before my birthday (a day that I was operating on approximately 2 hours of sleep because I’m always up all night) if I could go help my brother in the warehouse where he works because he really needs it.  I have already had altercations with my brother there from helping him a previous time. It was so bad that they sent me home early. So being there in general makes me uncomfortable. Even when I go in to help my dads department. So of course I didn’t want to help which wasn’t an acceptable answer to my mother and after about the 5th time of her saying something obviously I snapped and agreed to which she responded “forget it” and slammed my door shut. (It should be noted that in my mother’s defense I’m a nightmare to wake up because of how little I sleep. There are times I wake up and am in a fight with my mother because she apparently tried to wake me up and I was nasty, meanwhile I have literally no recollection of even speaking to her ) so my dumb ass trying to bite the bullet agrees to go work for eight hours in a hot sweaty warehouse with barely any ac on my birthday of all days. I woke up that morning still mad about the fight I had with my mother the day prior because I feel like as a grown ass adult I should be allowed to say no I don’t want to do something. \n\nGet to the warehouse work the shift, I leave at five, which apparently was a mistake because I wasnt supposed to leave until 5:30 which I thought was fine because 1) I genuinely thought they left at 5 every day and 2) I didn’t take a lunch break because I was hoping if we happened to get everything done early we would just be able to leave. Obviously that was wrong and I got a shitty passive aggressive text message from my brother.\n\nHaving already been in a bad mood from my fight with my mother the day before partnered with my brother annoying me after I had left I stopped by aunts house to vent because I was literally seeing red. Wasn’t even planning on going home for my birthday because I just didn’t want to be around any of them. \n\n\nThe next day comes and I don’t show up because not only did I not want to be there, but when I had gotten there the day before another employee of that company said “we don’t know if we’ll need you tomorrow or not yet” so I just didn’t bother to show up because if y’all needed me you should have worked that into your text message when you were being an asshole in my opinion. So of course my petty ass isn’t going to show up.  My brother comes home through the door doesn’t even put his shit down and is in my face screaming at me for not showing up “why should I have to explain to my boss why you didn’t come” “why do you get to sleep all day while we work I’m sick of it” turning to my mother “I’m sick of him aren’t y’all sick of him” (to which she agrees probably just trying to get him to calm down, but I won’t ever for a second forget you just said you were sick of me. ) and of course I’m running my mouth back in return, which is when he decided to put his hands on me, shoving me literally to the floor. And this is about where I Black out with anger because I had my Nintendo switch in my hand. The limited edition no longer in production animal crossing themed one at that. So obviously I’m pissed and yank his PlayStation out of the wall and slam it on the ground. You can skip the next parentheses part if you don’t care about why a stupid video game console made me so upset.\n\n(A detour to mention about these video game consoles. My brother and I used to exclusively use Xbox but I made the transition to the PS4 when it came out. My brother didn’t. I had been asking for a PlayStation 4 since they came out for both my birthday and Christmas for I think like two years. Until the year my brother spent Christmas in jail because he was addicted to flocka. When my mom finally bailed him out because she felt like he was actually clean, he got a PlayStation 4. When I asked why he got one and I didn’t despite it literally being the only thing I asked for as a Christmas gift, she said “well he wasn’t here for Christmas so I had to make it special.” I think I eventually got the PlayStation for my birthday the following year. But this fucking switch man. I swore up and down when I was a GameStop employee that they were going to make an animal crossing version and they all laughed at me said if it was going to happen it would have already and talked me into buying just a standard switch instead. Low and behold a few weeks later the animal crossing one is announced and I’m lowkey heartbroken that I just spent a majority of my money on the standard one. I eventually get myself so worked up over it that I asked my mom to front me the money to buy the new system, and I will give her 200 when I sell my switch and the rest from my next paycheck. She’s talking some I can’t I don’t have that kind of money, which would have been totally fine. I was just embarrassed that I not only put my pride away to ask for money, but was also upset enough about not getting the animal crossing one to even be in this situation. So whatever whatever we end up agreeing on if I sell the console first and give her the two hundred she will give me the rest. Where as I was only asking her for the front because I didn’t want to risk selling my console before the new one came out and risk then not having a console at all. Especially since I had already missed like two years of the switches lifespan.  So obviously I’m super thankful to my mom and I literally spent like two days thanking her and talking to her about it, only for me to find out that she had given me my own money. I don’t know what it was for, possibly my unemployment since the console came out around the time the virus was starting to flare. And at that point all I can keep thinking is wow. You really kept my own money from me, made me gamble on being able to find a limited edition console without a preorder. And told me you couldn’t loan me anything. That makes me so mad. How are you going to lie about my own damn money. Serves me right I guess for not being adult enough to stop using our joint bank account.) \n\nAnyway. I slam his PlayStation on the ground after he put his hand on me the first time we get into a screaming match in his room to which I say something along the lines of “you’re allowed to knock my switch out of my hand so why should you expect any different of your PlayStation” to which he responds (talking out of his ass) “well you didn’t pay for it mom did!” Jokes on you asshole not only did I pay for it entirely with my money but our mother literally withheld my own money from me and made it more difficult for me to get an already difficult to get console. This ends up with him coming back into my room because everyone in my family (myself included) has to have the last word in argument. Which leads to him putting his hands on me a second time except this time since there’s not a 400$ gaming system in my hand I pull his disgusting ass down with me.}}}}}\n\nThis whole fight somehow ends with me being kicked out of my house by my mother. \n\n {my thoughts on my mother}\n\n{{{{Fun fact. Maybe about a week before this my mother was begging me to stop going out despite taking precautions with a mask and specially made sanitizer consisting of primarily alcohol. Because they had a friend in critical condition from covid. This is the same woman who threw her kid out into streets during the first peak of this epidemic. (I’m in Florida so it is at this moment higher than that first peak because Floridians are trash) so I spend the next three or four day sleeping in my car doing whatever trying to manage on my own, spending what little money I had fixing the joycon drift on my switch that was non existent until my brother attacked me with it in my hand. One thing leads to another and I eventually end up back home. I asked my mom if we could start family therapy because I’m literally holding onto grudges that I don’t know how to let go of. She says when all of this is over but I’m positive she’s forgotten about it and it might very well be what causes me to cut her out all together. \n\nA few days ago me and my mother got into a huge arguement because she woke me up to ask me to take her to firestone to pick up her car(I’m exhausted but totally not a problem to me at all) so I get right up get dressed grab my keys and when I walk out of my room she goes “are you ready now I’m not in a rush or anything” I was a little annoyed by the stupid question I’ll admit, like you just two minutes ago came into my room to wake me up and ask me to take you. Yes I’m ready to go lol. Otherwise I’d still be asleep. She of course takes my flat response (a slight mixture of both my annoyance and exhaustion) as me being in a bad mood. So we get into my car and she’s overreacting because my car is a little shaky (which I’m almost positive is just because I need air in my tires) talking some oh my god we have to pull over what if you have a flat. Like we definitely would know if we were driving on a flat tire. It’s been doing this since like the second week I got this car. So I’m just sitting there trying to get to the destination as fast as possible trying to hold my tongue and not cause a fight when she sets me off and says something along the lines of “you’re in a bad mood because I asked you to take me” my response being “oh what I’m in a bad mood because I got right up to do something you asked me to do???” which fucking infuriated me and caused a screaming match in my car. I don’t understand why she has this god complex where she thinks she gets to tell other people how they feel about something. She did it to me on my birthday too which I forgot to mention and am now too lazy to go back and add in. But like it drives me crazy. I don’t care if they’re right wrong or somewhere in between. Nobody has the right to decide how somebody feels about something except for that person. So when I sit there and tell you I’m not mad and you tell me “yes you are mad that’s why you’re being shitty” that’s a self fulfilling prophecy right there. Of course that shits going to make me mad. If you’re just going to decide I’m in a bad mood for me then shit I guess I’m in a bad fucking mood then. \n\nSo this screaming match in my car leads to her saying “I hope something happens to your car, and when it does DONT call me”. I will never ever in a million years forget she said that to me. I hope that when something does happen to my car, I’m inside of it, I hope it’s something fatal, and I hope she has to live with it for the rest of her life. And then of course after our screaming match she sends me a passive aggressive text message (because apparently my family is famous for doing that shit) talking some I won’t be screamed at in a car that I bought you, you are SO disrespectful the next time you talk to me like that you can find a new place to live! (As if she didn’t kick me out when I was 16, and 18, and 23. Like clearly I can manage in my car bitch try me. I would rather starve to death on the streets than feel like I need help from someone who treats me like shit) Skip the parentheses if you don’t care about context with my car history\n\n(Both me and my brother were fortunate enough to get cars for our 16th birthday. The difference between us is my brother has wrecked I think 2 cars my parents bought him, one car they gave him because my mom got a new car (which that one he wasn’t at fault for but still it’s a car to add to your tally) and ruined one of my dads trucks that he was using for whatever reason one day.  I on the other hand drove the same car that I had since I was 16 until literally this year when I turned 25 and was given a new one. But honestly my parents had been trying to buy me another one for a few years I just fought them on it because I didn’t want a new car which I will explain why later. )\n\nAnd then now just today, we are in another arguement because I think last night, my brother walked out our back gate to go sell drugs in our mailbox because he thinks he’s cool and tough and can handle jail as if he isn’t literally crying “mommy bail me out” when he’s in there. As he’s going out he knocks over the ashtray I had been using over there (which was admittedly in the walkway but only because that particular night I was in a hurry to relocate under my backyard awning because it was raining and I had all my technology on me) but when he walks back he has the nerve to say to me “your ashtray is knocked over “ as if i wasn’t outside and heard him kick it over like I’m supposed to lean up after him. Despite us having literally not a said a word to eachother since April. So I hid the ashtray that he normally uses with the mindset of “if he needs an ashtray he’ll have to go over and clean up the one he kicked over.” Only for me to find that my mother ended up being the one to clean up his mess. Which of course infuriated me. And then she had the nerve to defend him in a text message after we got into an arguement about it. “Well it is your ashtray...” okay did I kick over my ashtray or did my brother. Because that’s the person who should have cleaned it up was who knocked it over. \n\nIn regards to my mother specifically it hurts me the most. Because I often at times feels like she’s the only one out of the 3 of my immediately family that I could have a relationship with or that I actively want to have a relationship with and that bridge is so close to being burnt to a crips. I don’t want to appear ungrateful because as a mother she does go above and beyond. I’ve been spoiled sure. But my problem with it is, I feel like my mother only gives as much as she gives so that she has ammunition to hold over peoples head. I fought her for YEARS about getting a new because I knew she would just hold it over my head. Which obviously I was right about. I remember being kicked out when I was 18 because I wasn’t working and i had just gotten kicked out of college and she said leave your keys pack your stuff and find somewhere to live. So I did set off with no car no money no nothing ended up being taken in by my best friends family. Spent a year or two there, and I literally did not get my car back (the same one she had given me at 16) until the girl I was living with literally called her in tears asking if we could just borrow it so we could go see her mother who was in the hospital because she needed brain surgery. LITERAL BRAIN SURGERY was the only reason I got my car back. And it still took my friend like two or three times of asking my mother for her to let me use my car just to take her to see her mother. \n\nMy father has always babied me and let me get away with more than he lets my brother get away with I can admit that. The problem with it is, that because I don’t feel the same type of yearning for a relationship about my father that I do about my mother I don’t really care about him favoring me. And because my dad tends to let me get away with more my mom feels like she has to let my brother get away with more, which in turn causes me to always just feel like I’m chasing my mother’s approval or some shit. }}}}\n\n\n\n {thoughts on my own disgusting self}\n\nIt’s only been recently that I’m starting to come around to my father and that’s only because I think I’m starting to hate my mother. \n\n\nI know I probably sound ungrateful and entitled. And I can see why. But I am truly thankful for how privilege I’ve been and all that I’ve been given. But I don’t know how to not feel the way that I feel about these things. \n\n\nAnd that’s not to say I’m perfect either. I’ve caused plenty of problem for my family. So let me just skip to all my flaws now. \n\nWhen I was a kid like before I could even start kindergarten I was literally already sucking dick. My next door neighbor ( my brothers age at the time) used to make me do it to him and I used to agree because he was considerably nicer to me when I do would so. He was already a problem child too but that’s neither here nor there. I was pretty much only sucking him off because my brother always hated when I would hang out with him and his friends, and the neighbor always let me hang around (for obvious reasons) distinctly remember my brother catching us a few times but I guess nothing was ever done about it. Not even sure if my parents know about it. \n\nBut as an adult I can see that’s where I started getting fucked up. Idk if I necessarily blame my neighbor for me being gay, because I do firmly as a gay man believe that it’s just who you are and can’t be changed, but I feel like there will literally always be a part of me that questions it. Like what if I wasn’t sucking dick at five years old, would I be interested in girls? I remember having a crush on at least two different girls before i met (what I now as an adult realize was probably my first boy crush) like looking back on my child hood I vividly remember playing “doctor” with other kids or truth or dare that always ended sexual and I realize like damn. That’s fucking gross we were all kids. \n\n\nFast forward to me being in I think middle school, and I was caught sexually experimenting with my cousin. I was definitely old enough to know better so I take fault there, but I also wasn’t ever the one initiating it. You know. I was letting him suck me off for longer than I can remember honestly, but I also distinctly remember I wasn’t the one initiating it. I still remember the first night at his house when he asked me to go pornhub and grilling him about how he even knows about that. I don’t remember when I started letting him do stuff to me, but I know that I shouldn’t have. I remember well enough that when he would come sleepover there were times I would opt to stay up late with my father in hopes that he would fall asleep waiting for me to come in. I remember one time I was up late and he comes walking out like 2 hours after being put to bed because he was trying to get me to come in to bed with him. But again I was the older kid in that situation. So that’s my fuck up. Obviously when we got caught it put a wedge between that side of our family. I can see why, but in hindsight I always wonder. Would you have still distanced yourself if you knew it was your son who had been initiating it? Because he was younger all the blame was pushed onto me. And I can see why. Again I should have known better. \n\nThat’s probably around the time I started getting fat. By high school at one point I was over 300 pounds and openly gay. Never had a serious relationship. Never even had someone interested in a relationship with me. I can see why. Not only was I cringey in high school but I was literally disgusting. It wasn’t till about my senior year I finally got back under 300 pounds and started losing some weight and gaining some confidence. \n\nBut here’s the kicker. Before I started losing the weight I had become a literal serial catfisher. And I’m talking like anybody you wanted to see naked I would go out of my way to target. Friends, friends boyfriends. Nobody was off limits to me. It makes me sick thinking about the hundreds of people I’ve catfished because I was horny and lonely. Catfishing even basically got me kicked out of my college ( granted I was surprisingly innocent at that time but because the kid found out about me being a catfish he refused to believe it wasn’t me, despite me literally having to show my catfish accounts to the dean and them not matching up to whoever he was talking to. The college only realized their mistake a semester or two later because the kid was immediately put on academic probation the semester following my suspension, and then got caught trying to do the same thing to another gay student the semester after that. Which is when they were like wow we were wrong we’re so sorry don’t even worry about the requirements we gave you for coming back you can just come back never did though.) \n\nIt wasn’t only until I hit maybe 22 or 23 that it like clicked with how awful what I was doing was. And started making an active effort to stop it. And I feel like I was only even willing to because I fell in genuine love with somebody I was catfishing. When I finally told him, we were fine for a few days. He told me he didn’t care that I was a guy because he fell in love with the person behind a screen. But all of that quickly crumbled to ashes. That’s another one that’s my own fault. Not only was I doing something shitty but I was also in too deep. I think I still to this day get texted from somebody I started catfishing when I was about 15 or 16 that I just am too afraid to finally tell the truth to. \n\nBut since the recent heart break I’ve thankfully been able to almost entirely remove catfishing from life save for the one guy I was in too deep with, and the old catfish accounts that I occasionally log into when I’m desperately alone/horny/whatever it may be. \n\nI’m tired of feeling alone. I just want to be loved. I want someone to want me. To care about me.\n\nI’m starting to realize this world is awful. Almost every thing and everyone in it is bleak. Some people genuinely want to live long happy lives, me personally, I don’t think I can make it doing this shit for another 25 years. Self deprecating jokes and suicidal humor are my biggest weapons. Because I feel like if I don’t turn them into jokes. I’ll let them overcome me. Too many people in this world are awful. I don’t want to be one anymore. \n\n\nI doubt any of you will actually care enough to read this through. But if you for some unknown reason did, then I thank you. Because I could really use a friend. \n\n\n\nTLDR; I’m a scumbag. I’m starting to think my family is scumbags, and I’m genuinely losing my will to live. I’ve been holding on to grudges that are literally consuming me and transforming me into a being of hatred and it makes me sick to my stomach. I don’t know how much longer I can do this, but god I would absolutely love to just be taken out by a bus tomorrow.",

Not having to hate myself, going through life everyday while nothing seems to make me happy anymore. Then my younger sister gave me a rock she painted for me. Blue with a guitar on it, and a moon with stars in the middle of the guitar. It said made in 2020, Love Nikole. I almost cried in front of her which is something she's never seen me do. It just hit me so hard, like beyond words. My family is very loving but they mostly keep to themselves. I just thought to myself, how could I put her and everyone else through such a thing. Spent half the night crying like a little girl, I'm 34M. Still woke up feeling like garbage, but I dunno somethings different, I guess that feeling like someone's thinking of me is helping a bit. I can't say anything to her now but in the future I'm really gonna thank her for that. I still feel like I don't wanna be here, but whereas before it was 100%, now I'm slightly on the fence about it. Hopefully this is a little inspiration for those out there thinking like me. I should probably reach out to her but things like that are so hard for me, plus then the whole family would know. Thats why i like coming here. It hurts but I feel like I must press on.",

    "body": "I (14M) have an extreme fear of exams. Especially if it's an exam in a subject where I'm weak at. I just hate them so much. If I get a bad grade, my parents will be very angry at me (asian parents of course). Exams just drain every ounce of my willpower to study along with any positivity that I have. Even if I do study, my mom will bombard me with questions, force me to learn even more and just ruin my way of studying in general. I remember I memorized 4 fantasy stories for an exam (where we had to write a fantasy story of course, and yes, children already have tests/exams worth 50% of the grade at 4th grade) when I was 11 and memorized tons of other stories for an exam for 5 hours straight when I was 12. Now I just don't want to study because it is NOT fun at all and the stuff that I studied for the exam won't be used for the rest of the year. The anxiety I get from exams flip my mood 180° and no matter what I do (go outside, play video games, talk with friends, etc.), it doesn't help. My anxiety only gets better once I survive through the exam and all the lectures my parents give me for my bad grade. And if y'all are wondering, my grades are very good, I have A's and B's on every subject except for german and woodworking, where I have a C.\n\nI love learning about stuff which I'm geniunely interested in, like game development (specifically coding), airplanes, trains, etc. I could probably learn about these things for hours on end and still not get bored. But when it comes to these exams where teachers and parents act like it's a life-or-death situation then learning seems like poison in my eyes. ",

Worrying about how youre affecting others and wanting that reassurance that you’re doing okay and that everything will be okay even when you’re in the wrong.

So regardless of if you needed that reassurance and never got it so you had to quickly learn how to get it from people or give it to yourself, if you needed that reassurance later in life, you’re just going to end up having to meet your own need again.

    "body": "Hi, I'm 17F, going through an insanely hard time. This is going to be toooo long, but I am going crazy.  \n\nFor the past few days, I can't stop thinking about death, mortality, and how we are our brains, how we have bodies, how there might be no spirit, no point, no point if you forget and lose everything you've ever had or done. It's insane. I have NEVER felt this way before. \n\nI don't believe in the Christian god, but I naturally believe in a higher power - the universe, fate, destiny, that life is like a story, that I will find a soulmate, and always leaning towards reincarnation or something similar. I have always perceived death as a stage, not the END. I have always felt at peace with it, and connected to it somehow. It was FINE. It was GOOD. \n\nWhen I was younger I used to have suicidal thoughts. Maybe not serious ones, never was going to go through with it, but I wasn't afraid to embrace death, it felt like a step in life. When I was even younger I had a few day period of thinking \"this person will die\" looking at anyone, but it wasn't some sort of morbid fear. It should be nothing new.\n\nA few months ago I ended up in the hospital for a few days because of a mysterious chest pain, I was sleep deprived, overworked, dehydrated... I had symptoms of a heart attack (no heart issues detected, I got better after being released), I genuinely spent those few days thinking I'd die. I was convinced it was a possibility then. The hospital advised me to get in therapy but I really didn't feel a need for it. But it STILL didn't feel so alien then. I was just upset that I led myself into not having enough time, I was motivated to create, be kind and live even better. I wasn't scared of the after, I just felt that I need more time! I am an artist and I have always believed in souls and meaning. I was happy just to live and I cherish my moments.\n\nA few days ago, I woke up very early before a test, and this just popped up in my head, like someone turned a switch. All those thoughts that we are animals, that there is no meaning. I don't even doubt animals have souls, that everything has a soul, I don't know. It's driving me insane. And even when I accepted everything in my head, I realized - this might not be a fear of death at all, I just think I became hyperaware of my consciousness and started losing my sense of identity. I know it's temporary. I get weird anxious thoughts every few months or years that bug me for a few days like this, about anything. But it just feels so bad. It's like stressful derealization. I want to be normal again. I am still a kid. \n\nI am not even actively, or rationally, worrying. It's just like something in the back of my head. A fear of fear. A fear of fearing this for any longer. This is the first time in my life I feel like it's something that is challenging to get through by myself, for the first time I feel like I need therapy or medication.\n\nUsually I can distance myself from any trouble by engaging with something else and can bend my mind to my will with ease. \n\nI spent the whole weekend, depressed, scrolling through TikTok (I haven't touched it for a year) in my bed, trying to remember how to LIVE again through the nonsense I watch. I feel like a ghost, jealous of other people for being alive, as if I am the only person aware of death. As if I forgot how to live without thinking about this 24/7. I even woke up in the middle of the night, the thoughts in my subconscious before I could even think of them myself. Normally, I feel bad wasting any time doing \"nothing\" or consuming content instead of creating. This weekend, I have no regrets, I just want it to stop. It's not even a conscious fear at this point, it's like I unlocked something. \n\nI immediately feel better and distanced from those thoughts after writing it down, but I think it's a very brief addiction to reassurance. I want to be stressed about life. \n\nThe feeling is like... disgust. It's so disgusting and repulsive to have my mind tainted like this. ",

    "body": "I need help. I’m a 20-year veteran with 4 deployments. During my first deployment, I suffered an injury on the left side of my face that required 2 surgeries (septoplasty and turbinoplasty) to repair a deviated septum and remove scar and bone/calcium built up after the injury. \n\nBefore the surgery, it felt like I couldn’t breathe out of my left side nose trail and affected my running and other physical activities until the surgery. 25 years have passed since then, but now I am starting to have some issues again.\n\nA few months ago, I began to suddenly wake up in the middle of the night with extreme anxiety, feeling like I couldn’t breathe. I ran outside the house feeling like I was drowning. It was wintertime, so the cold somehow helped, and little by little, with the help of my wife, I began to calm down. It had never happened before until now. Since then, I spoke to my PCM at the VA and got a referral for ENT. My psych prescribed a few Xanax for the anxiety for when it hits the worst. The ENT says there is not a deviated septum (which was my first though) not scar tissue built up over time (like before) but since the first time it happened, I started trying every single thing I can find to try to help it… from trying every single nose device that flares the nose to break better at night (have found a few that work, but my inside of the nose is now raw from the in/out and the mucus irritating it from the foreign device that was never before there), the Airwav mouth guard, trying Afrin and phenols prone sprays (kids dose only at night before bed), but it seems that  ow has become a crutch and I can’t sleep without all of these things… the thought of having to do this every night gives me even more anxiety. \n\nI remember the surgery I had. They put those plastic blades in the sinus cavity, and I remember I couldn’t breathe but through my mouth then. And the thought of it gives me anxiety. I don’t think I can make it through weeks of having those things in my nose for weeks until it heals, swelling goes down, and pain subsides… never mind that I can’t take pain meds because of prior issues with narcotics due to multiple surgeries over a 3-year period that kept me on pain management long-term that did their own damage… now it’s all me, nothing but Tylenol, and as I type this with my wife lying in bed next to me at 1:24AM not able to sleep because of this crippling anxiety that makes me have to take a half Xanax just to hope to be able to sleep while listening to anxiety-reducing meditations on YouTube… \n\nI am at a loss, and my mind wonders where it shouldn’t after thinking about it, having to deal with this long-term and worse, putting my wife through this… it affects everything from sleep, turns what could be a good day into a bad one, and I am tired of it… I just wanted to put this out there to see if someone else experiences this, knows what “this” is, does it have a name? A cure? What have you done to try to fix it that has worked?… I need to figure out how to control it before it takes over… any help is greatly appreciated.",

    "body": "Hi everyone. I just joined Reddit because I feel like I have to get this off my chest. I have the most supportive family and they understand as good as they can but you all **get** it.    \n\nI've been diagnosed with social phobia/anxiety/depressive mood when i was 15 (am 33 now). The worst part about my anxiety is that I'm like 5% resilient. Which gets me to the actual point.\n\nI usually make appointments (doctors etc) as early in the day as possible because then I have it behind me and can 'enjoy' the rest of the day lol. Though I'm like 2 days pre-anxious about any appointment and it ruins those two days. Anyways. I needed to get a fresh haircut, called my hairdresser, and got a spontaneous spot in the afternoon.    \n\nIt was a disaster. Not the hair (love it, and my hairdresser is the sweetest) but everything else. First, it was really warm outside. I have very light skin and warmth (inside or outside) always makes my face glow, especially the cheeks. Additionally I get these hectic (?) spots in random areas on my face, forehead, and neck. I'm leaving the car. There was a skateboarder and I literally thought it's the loudest thing I ever heard. Plus, friday afternoon a lot of people are out and about and at that point it became too much. I had no idea where to go, walked into the wrong direction until my dad pointed me in the right one. At the hair salon I sat there, looking in the mirror, and I saw that my face turned into a blood moon. Everything red except the area around my mouth which made me look like I just drank milk lol. Back at home I was ***exhausted*** and noticed the first symptoms (headache, a bit nauseous). Yesterday was peak zero. I felt that butterfly-sensation in my stomach, like creeping panic, and just had all the symptoms (nausea, dizziness, lightheadedness, weird eye thing) and went to bed very early. There I just cried relentlessly. Until I got tired and fell asleep. I slept 14 hours straight and am now back at ca 50%.    \n\nWhat made me cry the most though were all the memories of the time when I was still healthy. My pre anxiety life. I miss my old self. I was shy, but never that introverted. Though I'm very grateful for my life and I even like myself nowadays, but I can't stop comparing myself to \"normal\" people. Those who have a job (I'm currently on disability), and go somewhere fun. Football (soccer) stadiums or concerts for example. I realised that I might never go to a concert because the loudness would blow my brain out. Then again, I think that I don't have to do what others do. That it's perfectly ok to go my own way. Instead of concerts I might just go to the planetarium.   \n\nI also know that I have good days, not so good days, bad days, and excellent days. Just because friday was a fiasco doesn't mean that all future days have to be... right? It's just that right now in this moment I can't even imagine feeling better although I rationally know that it's not gonna be like this forever. I think I'm just scared that one day I'll never recover from a situation like this. Then again we're all stronger than we think we are. I feel like I'm all over the place. Sorry that it's so long and sorry for grammar errors.    \n \nI hope that you all have a peaceful day. ",

    "body": "I've had a very few run ins with anxiety situations throughout the past ten years. But a LOT more so recently. I'd say the past two years. I don't have much experience with it and I wonder what I should do about it, who to consult etc... \n\nBasically my very first time having a real anxiety episode was when my first child was born. It was right after months of over working at my job. I was under a LOT of stress, pressure to perform and long hours. I had clearly mismanaged and neglected my mental health during that time and it all came bursting out during my wife's giving birth to our firstborn. I had a huge panic attack. Felt like I had lost all control over my body and emotions for a good 2 hours minimum. After that I had nothing happen for like 1 year maybe 2. \n\nThe 2nd time, it happened when again I was exerting myself at work. I was on a romantic getaway with my wife (although I should have taken a longer getaway... I needed 7 days of rest instead of the added stress of trying to compensate for months of exertion through a mere weekend of rest). I was at the movies with her and right in the middle of the movie I had a tachycardia. Heart went racing so much I thought I was going to have a heart attack for sure. I even took my phone out, prepared to dial 911 and told my wife to be ready to call them in case I truly had a heart attack. Turns out it was another panic attack... Again for about 3 hours I couldn't get control back of my emotional state... Didn't help that I had a LOT of caféine prior to going in the movie theater plus the neglected stress overdose from work.... \n\nMore recently I started doing a rather difficult job. The stress is different. It's not from too many hours it's from the multitude of very negative self esteem emotions it produces. Has to do with starting a business and the early parts have been tough. It's hard not to compare and feel like a failure to myself and my family. So this time around its very degrading negative emotions that are taking their toll... Potentially other health issues. \n\nI've had two or 3 other tachycardia episodes within the last 3 months. But they were lesser in intensity except the first one. The other big one is I've been getting food impactions randomly throughout the last 2 years. Happened maybe 10 times or so. Various intensity levels. But basically, I end up with a feeling stuck food in my throat. I can still breath just fine, but it takes some effort to get the food gown to my stomach. Obviously stress doesn't help during those events as it tightens the esophagus even more I suppose. \n\nSo I've decided I really need to see a doctor soon because I don't know if these issues combined are real health issues from a physical problem (some heart condition or other)\n\nAnd I have no idea what to make of a my anxiety issues. My father is a retired army veteran who has PTSD. His situation is different but he can relate to some of the stuff I go through. \n\nI'd like to know if anyone here relates to what I just described and what you did about it to get better ❤️",

    "body": "I had a pretty shitty day yesterday, nothing bad necessarily happened I was just miserable and anxious. I have a job, a lot of family who love me, and I still live at home so I don’t have the stress of major bills. Thankfully I have my sisters because I only have two friends, who I hardly see, do anything with or talk to. And that’s most likely my fault because I don’t make an effort whatsoever. When I have a bad day like yesterday I just start to spiral into how shitty my life is as a whole. Like I honestly don’t understand how people function on a day to day basis with anxiety. It prevents me from doing so much and being happy. It prevents me from meeting new people, it prevents me from doing new things, it prevents me from doing things I’ve done in the past. I’m just so tired of dealing with it. It affects my stomach badly, it makes me have to pee all the time, it makes me sweat, makes me feel out of body. I don’t even know if it’s just anxiety or disassociating or depression or borderline personality disorder. ",

I found this out about a month before my birthday and didn’t really know what to do because I didn’t want to overstep where I wasn’t invited. All I really wanted was for one of my friends to actually tell me straight up so I didn’t feel like I did something wrong or they hated me. I’ve seen my friends since and they seemed normal, though I felt pretty down about the situation when I saw them, but I tried to bring it up a few times. No real conversations came of it, maybe they were avoiding it, and now it’s just been on the back of my mind. It makes me upset still, so I was wondering what I should do about it? I was really hoping one of them would have talked to me about it even after it happened, but no one has yet. Instead, they all asked if we could take a different trip to my cabin soon.

    "body": "Hi there,\n\nI've sort of always had anxiety, with peaks and troughs, but more recently it seems to have spiralled. I used to have anxiety in my teens, which I most notably had spiralling negative thoughts \"what if I'm gay and dont know\" is an example of MANY. For the purposes of this post I am 100% straight, which is relevant below.\n\nI had lots of anxiety and stress at work, which was understandable with a clear cause. A change of job has largely removed this. But this seems to have brought a resurgence in more general anxiety. \n\nI have anxiety with driving, finding immense overwhelm when parking if people are about to witness. I even take longer journeys to avoid junctions or roads I believe I won't like. I had work anxiety like I mentioned above. And have in the past and more recently had anxiety in the forms of various \"what ifs\" or negative feelings. I even have anxiety in making this post, as it feels to admit some kind of abnormality or weakness (which of course I know is ridiculous in terms of trying to help myself and fix things).\n\nMost recently, I've had spiralling thoughts on my 5 year relationship with my girlfriend. To be clear, I feel happy and we are in a good place and she is my better half in a lot of ways. However, I have developed this fear of not being in love or not happy?\n\nIt all feels confusing, I would say 95% of the time I love her to bits and feel happy. Then suddenly I get a negative thought, like \"what if we broke up\" or the \"what if I don't really love her\". I then spiral and I feel myself trying to convince myself that I do and why.\n\nLike I said before, I have always had various negative and anxious thoughts, some of which aren't how I am truly feeling. However it is so hard as I feel i dont know my own mind, and as a result im trying to convjnce myself or discover my true \"thoughts\". \n\nI'm not sure what to do with this, I don't want to break up and I don't want to question my relationship, and yet here I am spiralling trying to convince myself of that. Does anybody have this?",

    "body": "I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety a few times. But it started when I was in high school. Or the worst of it started in high school. I started having panic and anxiety attacks before school so severe I laid on the floor, dressed for school but unable to move, barely able to catch my breath and feeling like a complete and utter failure. After about two to three weeks of this I was pulled from the public school system, and later enrolled in an online public school a town over. Things settled down, I started medication and moved on with my life. Graduated high school and moved out of state when I was 18 with my then boyfriend. We got married and had two kids. I have stayed home with them since. My oldest is now seven and I started contract work about two to three weeks ago. At first the anxiety and panic attacks were less common, but still happened. I could find a way to calm myself and settle into the new normal of my job. But the last couple days? It feels like I’m stuck. My anxiety is filling me with panic, fear and dread. Then feeding my depression that I’m alone and I can fight or I can cave and let the world gobble me up. I had a panic attack two nights ago before bed. Dread from work and the inevitable of having I go to work. Then I woke up crying and shaking. Called in sick. Same routine for the last three days. But today I thought I could force myself to go to work and push through. I cried the whole drive ( which is an hour long). Sat in the parking lot for thirty minutes going in circles in my head. Anxiety telling me my kids are unhappy and struggling and it’s my fault. That the work day is going to get worse. That regardless of what I do I will inevitably cause harm to my husband. He works full time at the same place I am doing contract work. Then it feeds the depression. The depression reminds me I’m alone. That the schedule of our day doesn’t allow me to feel or process the anxiety. I just have to keep moving, but I’m weak and a coward. That my husband will leave me and I’m nothing. That k will never compare to the female coworkers that he has. There’s something wrong with me but I can’t fix it. That I’ll never fix it. And I’ll be stuck forever. That I’ll always trap those around me. I’m just a burden to all those I care about. Then the anxiety ramps up again. That my husband will want to leave me because I have embarrassed him. Making everyone’s life more difficult and I’m failing at stepping up when I want and need to. That if I can’t do it now then I’ll never be able to step up. I’m just stuck. I feel alone and like a failure and my mind won’t stop the circle cycle of anxiety -> depression -> anxiety -> depression. ",

Now since that last panic attack everyday my chest and stomach always feel warm inside and I always have discomfort in my chest as if ima go into a panic or anxiety attack. All of the panic attacks has sent me to the ER for being scared of a heart attack. I don’t know how to handle it on my own. I’m trying meds but I believe they don’t work. I got a lot of bloodwork and test done and they come back normal so I guess it’s nothing that I’m thinking like cancer or anything else. However I feel so much physical pains like joint pains, back pains, stomach pains, head pressure, some weightloss, sometimes I gain but I also lose again when my stomach pain gets bad and diarrhea. Anxiety is taking over my life. A lot of times noise can trigger me like it stresses me out and gives me discomfort in my chest.

    "body": "If there’s one thing life has humbled me with time and again, it’s how difficult it is to survive as a person from a broken home who’s trying to find love / hope. And it’s not because you’re particularly unlucky, but because you simply don’t believe you can win. Life has never given it you in a platter and you grow up seeing how scarce your life is even in terms of resources that aren’t even that hard to find or be provided with. My parents have had an unhappy marriage their entire life, one where you can visibly see how tired they are of each other and are only continuing because they decided to have “kids”. You learn to perceive yourself as a liability in such homes before you could even learn what it means. I was the older kid in that household which means my parents definitely did a better job with my younger sibling than they did with me. Being born felt like the wrong thing to do and growing up felt like a struggle. I could never trust people by sharing what happens at home because my parents had an “image” to maintain. I’m not sure how much truth am I revealing even now but I’m trying. And it’s less for the viewers and more for my own satisfaction that I didn’t keep all of this to myself. That someone knows. That someone somewhere might be going through something similar and maybe this post tells them life is hard and it would continue to be hard but you’ve got you and that’s all that matters on most days. My life has particularly been hard across aspects (family, studies, love, job). When u started venturing out of my home I was 17, I chose the college farthest from home because that was the only way of getting away from the toxicity which focusing on what could be relied on in the future — my education. I got bullied a month into college for being different. I was an introvert, always into myself, didn’t talk much and often appeared distressed due to the environment of constant fights I had come from. I had my hostel roommates boycott me and call me names. I had a senior in college who liked me, lack of people in my life u needed to survive lead me to agree to a relationship with him. He was five years older to me and that should tell you a lot about how dominated I was in that relationship. He asked for my Facebook password, changed my relationship status, mentioned his name on my profile, and unfriended all the guys on my profile. And I was so weak, that I couldn’t even confront him about this. I knew he won’t listen and might retaliate. So I did what most girls would — forgot about it. A year passed by and I was banned from talking to any guy in college. If I did, it was met with allegations and blames of me trying to get attention. I survived that relationship with zero friends. Again a toxic ground that I couldnt talk to people about. Six months later, I heard from a friend that he was found kissing some girl at a party last night (a party he advised me to not come to). Obviously that friend told others about it too (gossip travels fast in college) and people started coming to me to tell me about more incidents like these where he did things with other girls over the past two years. I was distraught, once again had no one to go to, and couldn’t see what tomorrow would look like. Thankfully I had some friends who had gotten better friends over the course of the college who supported me through it and who I’m indebted to for life. My boyfriend kept on denying these allegations until he finally accepted them a year down the line. He pursued me and the relationship further for two more years until he finally gave up. I think something inside me that was carrying hope also broke with that relationship and it has only been breaking more the more encounters I have with guys and people. I think the society demands you to wear a certain face to participate in it and be deemed as “you belong”. I don’t know if it’s my inability to wear that face or disapproval to the concept, I feel like I dont fit in. And that takes the joy out of living? Not fitting in? Animals bring me more joy than humans do. I at my core, detest humans and I’m not sure if this could be a successful way to go about life. Id be a miserable human and hence a more toxic one if this school of thought isn’t challenged. This does give me anxiety, like it’s being in a group you know you secretly hate. Navigating in a world you know no one would ever understand you in. I’m not sure if it’s my series of experiences or conditioning that makes me the way I am. If you are me, what helps you go through life knowing people are shit and all of this is pointless? ",

    "title": "Looking for any tips/ advice to help with driving anxiety, especially when driving alone",
    "body": "TLDR: I recently got my driving license and more recently a car, but I feel quite anxious to drive especially since I’m now doing it alone (learned with a driving instructor as I didn’t have access to a car otherwise). Any tips or advice for before, during and after a drive, would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!\n———\n\nFor some of context, at the end of last year I finally got my driving license and more recently a car. I say finally as I’m 27 and knowingly delayed learning to drive due to the anxiety of both driving in general and the process of getting a license. I had started learning to drive at 18, but when I moved away for uni, instead of continuing I convinced myself that I was too busy, which was partly true, but not entirely. I’m still really proud that I took the steps to get my license despite the delay! I passed the theory a year earlier, delayed starting the practical training by about 6 months, then started learning with a driving instructor (as I don’t have access to a car), and eventually passed the driving exam on my first try! I was so anxious for my first driving lesson that I contacted the school to reiterate that it’d be my first time driving. They of course reassured me that it would be fine, and the instructor was really good and supportive throughout!\n\nI definitely know that the hardest part is getting started and that the more I drive, the more comfortable I’ll be. BUT, my issue is that I’m now doing this alone. Well obviously it was always going to come to this, but having an instructor next to me made me feel less anxious. I know I need to be calm while driving, but even the thought of getting into the car and driving somewhere is causing me to feel anxious. Like even now I’ve been thinking of going out to run some errands for the last few hours, but the uncertainty of things is making me think that I should take a bus instead and while there scope out the area for how I’d do it with a car.\n\nI’ve currently only driven about twice since getting a car. My main areas of anxiety include:\n1) Attempting to drive in/out of my apartment’s parking garage (the ramp seems so narrow and yet two cars should supposedly be able to drive up/down next to each).\n2) Parking in a bay especially between two cars (I never learned how to do this which is strange since I’d probably do it a lot more than parallel park).\n3) Parking in general (if I drive anywhere I’ll need to park, but where and how does it work? What if I drive into a carpark and there’s an issue and I’m stuck? What if I don’t find a space? Do I just go home?).\n4) Turning into or from a side road where you need to wait until it’s safe to do so (in approaching where I’d want to turn, I feel like I’ll start thinking ‘what if I never find a gap?’ or ‘what if I can’t actually turn here?’ or ‘what if I cause a hold up of cars?’).\nThere’s probably some other things too, but again I’ve only actually driven twice so I’m not sure. I know overthinking definitely doesn’t help either.\n\nAny suggestions would be greatly appreciated! I really enjoyed driving while I was learning, and I think I would enjoy it more if I wasn’t so anxious.\n\nI’ve procrastinated going out long enough, so I’m going to try go out now. Honestly if I get out of the parking garage alone (and get back down), I’d take it as a win! Sure it’s not ideal, but at this point I’d consider it a success compared to not going at all!\n\nI just hope I actually do it since I’m starting to feel the hesitation return at the thought of going.",

I was on meds before, got better, and was able to function normally for years. But over the past few months, my anxiety has come back hard, to the point where I struggle to leave the house. On top of that, I’ve had stomach issues since September, which makes me terrified of being out in public in case something happens. I recently restarted Prozac to help, but I’m still in the early stages of treatment.\n\nA close friend of mine is getting married later this year, and I’m in his groom’s party. He invited me to his bachelor party next month, and I said yes. I even booked my flights, thinking I’d be able to push through. But as the trip gets closer, I realize I’m not in a place mentally where I can handle traveling, socializing, and being away from home. He just reached out to confirm my plans, and I’m torn.\n\nI don’t want to be a flake, but I also don’t want to force myself into a situation that could make my anxiety worse. At the same time, I know avoidance only reinforces agoraphobia, so I feel guilty for backing out. Should I cancel now and be honest with my friend? Or should I try to push through and go, hoping that I’ll be okay once I’m there?\n\nWould love to hear from anyone who has been in a similar situation.",

But it scared me so now I wanna stop drinking energy drinks and see if it can help bc I get some reflux during the day as well. But it triggers my anxiety anytime I have to do anything “new” and my head fills with thought and it is literally just to stop drink a monster but I can’t in my head. Anybody else do this? \n\nAlso I started pregabalin - can that be the reason why I have this acid reflux? ",

I am 22 years old and have struggled with anxiety for a few years now only recently deciding to take action. It has interfered with previous relationships and honestly, ruined them.\n\nI’m feeling worse than I ever have and I am overthinking absolutely everything. It is also causing rifts in my relationship and I am worried. Also, I can’t sleep!! I wake up about 5-6am with terrible anxiety and “that stomach feeling”.\n\nIs it going to get better? Is Prozac best for anxiety?\n\nI would appreciate similar stories to mine as I am not feeling too optimistic.\n\nThanks.",

    "body": "I am 29F, introvert, and my financial conditions aren't great. Currently, i work from home, but the job doesn't pay as much as it should. And the growth options are limited because i live in a city with limited employment opportunities (at least in the field that i am working in currently), and i can't move to another city.\n\nI am at a stage in life where i need financial stability. There is a job opportunity that may give me financial stability to some extent. There are other pros also. For example, i have worked at that organization previously and know many people there. Those people are all friendly and helpful, and that organization was very good to me.\n\nSo, the problem is: that job is a teaching job. And teaching has felt very alien to me. Idk why. I used to feel like i have been placed in an alien land when i was put in the middle of kids. I did my job decently at that time, but i don't think i have the empathy or extrovertedness required for teaching. Additionally, this position is a higher position than the position i worked at previously, so the responsibilities would be much higher.\n\nI don't know whether i should apply for this opportunity. I feel extremely anxious about the changes in my life that will happen if i get the job. I am also worried whether i will be able to do the job well enough and whether i will be happy. On the flipside, i know that if i get this job, i will have financial stability and many of my problems would improve.\n\nLately, i have been feeling like i am failing the people around me. They think that i can do so much, but i don't feel like doing anything other than wake up, do my current job, eat, meet friends sometimes, and go to sleep. This lack of ambition is killing me. I see people around me chasing money left, right, and centre. I want to do that too but i don't do anything for it. People tell me that i am stuck in my comfort zone and that i need to get out of it to do better things. Deep down, i think they are right.\n\nFor a long time, i didn't feel the need to change anything in my life. But lately, i am feeling like i must bring a change, at least career wise. My mother is getting old; i need to be financially stable to give her a good life. So, i am wondering whether i should apply for that job, even though i might not enjoy it.\n\nAny advice would be appreciated. Thank you for taking the time to read this long post.\n\n",

    "body": "I have frequent negative and delusion thinking that I know doesn’t make any sense but in the moment it’s terrifying. Just for example, my brain convinced me last night that the floor was not real, I was in a movie, my family wasn’t real, and the world was ending. I felt like I was sinking into the ground below me and I couldn’t understand how the world could be real. I felt like I was in like an apocalypse. My pretty frequent anxiety attack is my brain will constantly tell me I’m going to throw up as I am emetophobic. This happens everyday, multiple times a day. Sometimes it will last all day, sometimes it comes and goes. I have never had a day without it, though. I have had addiction problems in the past so I really don’t wish to be on any type of sedative like xanax. I take effexor, clondine for sleeping, and buspirone from time to time. They are helpful. I rarely have panic attacks but I would say that the anxiety attacks are worse for me. It’s also hard because it’s mainly just my thinking that causes it and no medication can make me stop thinking. \n\nI try to be around friends and family, but my brain tells me they aren’t real and also I don’t like stressing others. I had a boyfriend who used to scream at me and physically attack me for crying or having panic attacks so it’s really hard to talk to others about it. I try to fill my mind with something else like coloring or playing a game but it’s really hard when your brain is telling you that you are actively dying and you start having those classic symptoms like dizziness, nausea, and heart palpations. It’s like I have a parasite in my brain that is constantly telling me things that I know aren’t true and that make no sense. I feel like sometimes I’m going into psychosis like I’m losing reality. I know that isn’t true. I have severe PTSD so not feeling like I’m in reality has been half my life, but it never gets less terrifying somehow. \n\nI’m not depressed but I feel so stuck in this that I would rather die than feel like this for the rest of my life. For the first time, I want to live and do better but, it feels like my brain doesn’t want me to. I want to go to therapy so bad, but I live in a small town with every counseling or therapy office around on a 6 month-1 year waiting list or they just aren’t taking new patients. Is there any advice or tips that have helped you? Honestly even if you don’t have any advice, just telling me you understand would be helpful. I feel so alone. I’ve never met or seen anybody with anxiety as bad as mine. ",

    "title": "My experience with severe anxiety.",
    "body": "Hi all, I thought I would share my experience as a 16 year old girl with diagnosed GAD (generalised anxiety disorder) and PD (panic disorder). I understand how intense and traumatic it can be to live in such a state of mind, and how often it’s underestimated. I hope this brings comfort to anyone going through anxiety, and that it gives those blessed with mental stability an idea of how debilitating it can be for someone with mental health problems. \n\n\nIt all started when I was around 8-9, I remember I would often have episodes of derealisation. For those who don’t know what it is, it’s essentially when your brain clocks out, everything feels like a dream; a haze, fight or flight mode, an out of body experience. If you smoke weed or drink alcohol, you can grasp the idea of derealisation. I would have quite severe episodes of derealisation, it literally felt like I did ketamine at times, and that was one of the symptoms of my anxiety. Another symptom I had was that I was delusional, that something out of the ordinary was a bad omen. \nHere’s an example:\n\nI once walked into the kitchen and spotted a cloth with blood on it, a normal person would think nothing of it, I mean, it’s a kitchen lol. My delusional self thought it was a sign of death, I immediately had a panic attack, I couldn’t breathe, I felt pumped full of drugs, I remember begging to be taken to hospital whilst everyone laughed at me, genuinely felt like I was in a horror movie. \n\nSo you can imagine how bad my anxiety was, panic attacks, derealisation, and delusion. Now due to other issues I was put on antipsychotics and muscle relaxers at the age of 10 which put my anxiety to rest. From then on my anxiety was put to rest, I still knew I had it but it was much more manageable, until the summer of 2024. \n\nI’m not sure what triggered it, stress, maybe the fact I hadn’t taken my meds for years, I have no clue. All I remember is that I first started to hyper fixate on my skin, I would search for bumps, or any weird spots. There ended up being red blotch on my skin which triggered an obsession with skin cancer. Weeks later I had an ear infection, the words “sepsis” and “brain infection” flooded my mind. I saw a girl on TikTok with a fatal motor neuron disease known as “ALS”, and I immediately started fixating on my hand grip and symptoms associated with said disease. \n\nWeeks passed and it became worse, I experienced fatigue, I had become more anxious, and had to sleep with my mum at times. But nothing could’ve prepared me for what happened a few months later. \n\nAfter summer ended, I moved to a new home, and that’s when shit started going down. I was petrified of cancer, I had panic attacks every night, EXTREME derealisation, brain fog, tension headaches, and just a complete change of mental state. The worst part is that this went on for a month before it got unbearable, I genuinely thought this was as bad as it could get, but boy was I wrong. \n\n9:30pm, early/mid October, I suddenly had a panic attack that lasted 5 hours. All I can remember is that my brain didn’t feel right, that I thought I was having a psychotic break, that I was going to die. I spent hours rocking back and forth in my mums bed as she took care of me, it was so horrific. The next day I was completely bed bound, I didn’t sleep the whole night. For the next 3 weeks I would have 2-3 panic attacks a day, I would have the most intense physical and mental symptoms. This included:\n\nPhysical \n• Vomiting \n• diarrhoea \n• trembling\n• constant urination \n• chest pains \n• abdominal pain \n• blurry vision \n• headaches \n• muscle tension \n\nMental \n• Hallucinations (visual, sensual, and taste)\n• Impending doom \n• panic attacks \n• delusion \n• brain fog \n• memory loss\n• general depression \n\n+ SO MUCH MORE.\n\nI could go on and on about how horrible my experiences were, this is just the tip of the iceberg. But I figured it’s getting too long and the idea of this was to be of reassurance. If you are struggling with something like this, just know that anxiety can present itself in such severe forms, it’s not a silly, teenage girl illness, any severe mental illness is bound to severely affect someone. With that being said, there is hope. I spent 5 months in such a horrific state, some have managed to survive YEARS. I’m not there yet, but I’ve gotten better, Zoloft has really helped me, as well as support from my family and friends, and obviously reading similar experiences on Reddit. I promise things get better, and once it does those awful experiences will be buried. Take care of yourself for now, take your meds, drink something, and just know that so many people are struggling with the same thing. ",

    "body": "Hello everyone, for starters, I’m 23F, and my best friend is also 24F. We’ve been best friends since early elementary school, and I’m almost done with college now. I really feel bad for thinking and feeling this way because my best friend has always been good to me and my family. She’s always been there for me, going above and beyond, and spoiling me, really. She’s gotten us many gifts on all special occasions like birthdays and Christmas and is close with my family.\n\nThe issue is that my best friend can be a very negative person, and I’m the type of person whose mood is affected by the people around me. I grew up as the eldest child in a family whose parents hate each other but stay together “for the kids,” so I always felt like I had to fix everyone’s problems and moods. This led to me developing really bad anxiety and a people-pleasing personality. Surprisingly, I think that’s why I got along so well with my best friend since she didn’t have a good family growing up either. She’s been through so much—one of her parents isn’t in her life, and she’s been through toxic relationships, etc. We practically text every day, but lately, over the last couple of weeks, I’ve felt like she hasn’t wanted to talk to me or just gets annoyed with anything I have to say or tell her. She doesn’t like when I “offer solutions” to her problems or try to help her out of a negative mindset or even with financial decisions.\n\nShe constantly makes bad decisions for herself, like dating people who aren’t good for her, going into debt, wrecking multiple cars, and spending all her money on fast food and shopping. Then she complains about how everything is expensive and how she doesn’t have money, blaming it on her job. While they don’t pay her much, she doesn’t even try budgeting, and whenever me or her grandparents tell her this, she gets annoyed and says she can’t because it’s little money. At this point, I’m really tired of her complaining, especially since most of her problems are self-inflicted. Yet, she continues to complain about how the universe hates her. I really can’t stand it anymore; I can’t have a conversation with her without her turning it into something negative. She also has terrible insecurity issues.\n\nI feel bad because she’s been going through a lot of health issues and is worried about that, but over the years, she’s been in and out of hospitals because of her anxiety. No matter who she sees, they tell her she’s fine and that her anxiety is making her believe she’s having a heart attack or stroke or that something’s wrong with her heart, seizures, etc. Whenever I tell her she’s a hypochondriac, she gets pissed and complains that no one understands her. I really try; I really do, but she’s very stubborn, and honestly, it feels like she’s the one who won’t listen to anyone else around her.\n\nWe’ve also had conversations about relationships before, and she will continuously tell me that my idea of love is unrealistic because I want someone who’s loyal and who doesn’t participate in hookup culture, someone who thinks of those things as something special, who can hold a conversation and be open and vulnerable with you—not someone closed off who can’t communicate, etc. She thinks that because I read so many romance books, my idea of love is fantasy and that real people aren’t like that. She also criticizes my ex for how he treated me (and he wasn’t a peach—he ghosted me a lot and made me feel crappy), but when I point out that her boyfriend and exes are worse, she gets upset with me.\n\nI just don’t like feeling like she thinks I don’t know what I’m talking about, or that she’s smarter than me or knows more and invalidates anything I say to her. And if you’re going to complain about it, what should I do?\n\n",

Last month I averaged 3 panic attacks a week, three weeks ago I had 6, two of twice were on the same day and since when I’ve averaged one a day. \n\nToday I was on the London tube with my girlfriend going from Oxford Circus to Finsbury Park, while on the busy train I randomly had got hit with probably the worst panic attack I’ve ever experienced, I struggled to keep myself up as I was unable to sit down because again the train carriage was packed. As soon as we got off the train I immediately collapsed onto the floor, lost all awareness of my surroundings and I couldn’t hear anything other than my racing heart beat and my intense breathing\n\nThankfully I had my girlfriend with me who did her best to comfort me through physical contact as that would was the only way that I was able to process that I wasn’t alone, apparently a few people stopped to try talk to me but again I lost all spatial awareness so I wasn’t even aware that they were there. I felt like I was trapped in a small dark box, I felt extremely claustrophobic and also felt like I was suffocating. would there be any reason to why I’m experiencing these panic attacks especially on such a regular basis? And how can I make them stop?",

Doctors have listened to my heart and lungs and they mention it sounds fine. And the fact that my chest pains are musculoskeltal since I was diagnosed with costochondritis and my PT noticed my pecs were super duper tight. And I'm seeing a cardiologist in about two weeks for a comprehensive look at my cardiovascular system to hopefully receive full closure\n\nIn spite of ALL This evidence, I still am horrifically anxious over my heart to the point where I'm always placing my hand over my chest to feel my pulse, I'm touching my chest a lot, etc. my musculoskeletal aches and pains are making me super duper anxious I'll just collapse of a heart attack or that I have heart condition.\n\nHow do I ultimately convince myself that my heart is fine",

I found a work from home job and am finally getting on meds and doing therapy. my anxiety is mainly health/travel related. I tried celexa and that was awful so switch to lexapro (only 3 weeks in) prescribed by my gp. gp suggested psych for medication management and honestly I was on board bc I can do telehealth rather than going back to my gp’s office all the time. well I had my intake tonight and at first I left the session not knowing how to feel, she said some good things and some things I did not like at all. I don’t agree with one of the medications she put me on (tried to add cymbalta to lexapro) and wanted me to try propranolol. I was excited to try the propranolol until I read it is contraindicated with asthma which she knew i had. however the thing I’m upset with the most, she criticized my health issues and suggested there was something more wrong with me. I have eczema, asthma, and allergies and she kept suggesting that I need to see a rheumatologist. I’ve had plenty of tests run by my gp and gastro doctor and neither are concerned right now about autoimmune disorders. at first I left the session agreeing with her that I needed to make appointments to see more doctors, and now I’m laying here realizing she reignited my health anxiety when tbh it hasnt been too bad on the lexapro. I’m so upset now that this woman took my valid concerns about health anxiety and almost used them against me.

I was diagnosed with a chronic dermatitis where the capillaries in my legs burst and leave coin shaped red marks on my skin. For most, as is for my case, the issue is benign. Not much is known about the condition but, the first course of action is rebuilding the capillaries. The best supplements are Vitamin C 500mg and Rutocide (or Rutin) 50mg, both twice a day. I’ve been taking both for three weeks now and the progress is slow, but it works. The Rutocide, however, has terrible side effects like nervousness, fast heart rate, swelling legs, swelling joints, water buildup in the knees, joint pain, nervousness, and dizziness.\n\nI was fine until last week when all of these side effects hit me at once. I had surgery in 2022 that caused me to go into urosepsis. I was in the hospital for four days until my fever and tremors finally went down. I’ve had health anxiety ever since. In 2023, I had another surgery that left me fighting a UTI for four months. I’m 37 years old now and, every twitch, pain, swelling, hollow feeling… it keeps reminding me that I am getting older and my body is deteriorating. I eat well; I work out; I’m healthy. It’s still going to happen. It scares me. It scares me because I just met someone I love intensely. Work is great.

I think this is weird attention-seeking behavior and you should speak to a therapist (my parents won't get me into therapy) instead of describing your breasts to strangers online over and over, especially since vou are supposedlv 14 or 15 vears old. according to your posting history. this is not okay behavior. (Again I don't have anyone else to talk to)\nWhen I replied that I was sorry and I would try they edited their comment to\n\"edit: based on their comment history\nI'm actually not convinced this is a 14/15 yo girl, I think this is someone larping as one.\" (Okay my comment history isn't me going \"Oo sexy lady oo la la~😏😏 “Let me see your titties and\nI'll pay you🥵🥵” it's literally me laughing with women in the certain community because I posted a post asking if women can relate to something with their cherries that's what I usually post in that group I posted ONE post today asking about my cherry shape and that's it. Most of my comment history is birds and other stuff)\nAnd another comment\n\n\"You have at least 5 posts to big boob subs ((AGAINN I only asked funny questions in that sub she was talking about.. \"did you ever deal with this etc etc\")) in less than a week, and this is at least your third different post about your breasts today, with the other two talking about how large they are. And you're 14??\nIt's coming across like you're a 50 year old man with a fetish trying to get other women to talk boobs with you. If that's not what you are, you need to examine your actions\"\n\nI deleted my posts and left just bird and stuff on there and other stuff but\nI'm not a perverted man l'm a teenager. I messed up so bad and I'm scared to tell my parents about this because I already feel like a failure.. I'm literally crying and shaking like I why do I always screw things up? I wasn't trying to sound like a pervert I swear I wasn't. Now I can't delete my history of these comments and this is going to stick with me forever. I'm going to look back on this day and think \"I'm a dumbass and failure and everyone thinks l'm a pervert!!!\" Then roll in my sheets and cry like l'm doing right now l'm not even joking. \nAnd now because I'm scared people are going to say \"why are you so scared if it isn't true?\"…\n\nOkay now that I ranted go ahead laugh at me and think I'm a perverted pedofile man whatever because I'm sure that's what all of y'all are thinking of me but I swear I just joke around with people and post my birds but I got carried away thinking about my appearance too much and asked too many questions and posted too much.\nTo the ladies that thought I was a pedo I’m really sorry I was just confused and curious. 😕",

But the second I kept reading, the pressure came back even worse, and I just couldn’t calm down. Next thing I knew, I was having a panic attack. I legit couldn’t read fanfics for one month after that, I remember being sad and having more panic attacks because I couldn’t read any fanfics, and I always read them to calm down and before sleeping.\n\nThe only way I got over my fear of reading fanfics was by binge-watching media with the characters from the fic that gave me the panic attack. Like, I just kept watching and watching until, I needed to read a fanfic yes or yes. And when I finally did nothing happened. No panic attack, no freakout. Just me enjoying the fanfic like a normal person. 🙏\n\nIt’s such a dumb story, and I’ve never told anyone because it’s honestly so embarrassing but I wanted to get this off of my chest, i needed to tell someone 😭 and I’m so happy that I finally can read fanfics again!",

So like 6 months ago I was in a nail salon, everything was fine, I was in a good mood, and suddenly I felt like a weird \"rush\", kind of a wave from my head to my legs while sitting, and then extremely fast heart beat for couple of minutes. I called ambulance and had very high blood pressure but EKG was fine. Maybe it was arrythmia, I don't know.  Took a while to get over it but I kind of did.\n\nNow, ten days ago I was running, again everything was fine, beautiful day, and I slow down the run, start walking and all of a sudden I feel extremely dizzy, and fast heart beat again. I had to sit down in the park. It again calmed down but after this I have been extremely scared, anxious ...\n\nTwo days ago I was in front of laptop, sitting at home, and out of the blue I started feeling dizzy, world spinning. I went to lay down and it just was getting worse, I was super scared, I felt I was high on something (but not in a good way) and the heart rate was over 100. I called an ambulance, I started getting very cold, trembling, spinning feeling in the head. Ambulance came, everything was fine, it started to go better after. My partner gave me a mild xanax and after this I was almost normal but shaken.\n\nI tend to get these dizziness rushes daily now, and again just now I got dizziness feeling,  my chest feels heavy, a bit heavy to breathe, hands feel heavy and I feel I am not completely in this universe, like just a weird feeling. Head is heavy. Heart beat is fine. I did some anxiety breathing exercise and just try to tell myself everything is fine and I won't die but I don't like the progression of these symptoms.\n\nSorry if this message was messy explanation but I hope to find some support.\n\nDo you experience similar symptoms ? What do you do to stop them or just wait for it to go away ? This is fucking annoying and I hate to be scared and \"on the edge\" all the time now.\n\nHave a nice evening <3",

I am worried about him but if I say something about it I know I will sound crazy or controlling. I don’t need to be in contact with him because I don’t trust him or think he is not loyal, when he strays from the usual schedule with no heads up my mind automatically goes to the absolute worst case scenario. I’m genuinely worried about him and his safety. \n\ntoday after the call my bad feelings got worse, I was in the middle of eating lunch and I immediately lost my appetite and the feeling keeps getting worse. he answered my call quickly and he told me exactly what I would’ve needed to hear to chill me out but I can’t shake this awful feeling today for whatever reason and now I have to go to work. \n\nhow can I tell the difference between my instinctual gut feelings and unjust anxiety? what can I do about this feeling when it doesn’t go away? \n",

I have experienced some of the worst days of my life (for at the time what seemed like no reason). I have GAD and panic disorder and have struggled with both of these for years but it recently became much more intense since I stopped working to finish school. It got to the point where I knew I needed to seek help because I was not okay. The first medication I tried which was pristiq made me feel even worse from the side effects. The next medication I tried  which was propanalol seemed like night and day. I felt “cured”until today. Today marks one week since taking it. After feeling like I was over this dark phase in my life I felt it creep back today and it wouldn’t go away. I had to cancel on the family I was supposed to babysit for today and felt so bad because my anxiety has been so bad. I am trying to look at this as just a small setback but it was extremely discouraging to cancel on them. I thought I would be okay to go babysit and just feel so guilty too. I’m also worried this will become more than just a small setback. There were times in the last few months where my anxiety was at a 10 for days on end. I am worried this is the start of one of those long episodes. I was also supposed to start therapy last week but the therapist had an emergency and we can’t start until this week. I just want to feel like me again, this entire process of improving my mental health has been so exhausting and unpredictable. ",

(One of my worst fears when things like this happen is that I will shit my pants) Was plotting my escape, the bathroom or run to my car and leave. Felt trapped, overwhelmed, that everyone knew I was freaking out inside. I was able to focus on my breathing, recognizing the intrusive thoughts, grounding in my body, trying to be compassionate towards myself...And the feelings started to ease off, slowly deescalating.\n\nI recently had been feeling better and doing a lot of things that a few years prior didn't feel possible with my level of anxiety. After this episode passed my reaction was to be pretty bummed. Like I had regressed and moved backwards. But I know the goal isn't to make it go away completely but be able to move through it. And the small success of that is worth celebrating. I stayed at the Cafe, I wanted to prove to myself I was safe, that it was my head tricking me.\n\nAll that is to say that I see you all, anxiety is horrible, it robs you of your identity, personality, of enjoying life. And it sucks feeling like you're constantly fighting yourself. I've been working on it, been in therapy for years and the progress can feel excruciatingly slow. But it's possible to move through, to manage. I hope for you all and me that the good days outnumber the bad.",

I already have a plan to get out of this neglectful filthy environment. In currently studying my drivings test and planning on getting a car and my driver's license with my parents by the time I turn 18, and when I'm 18, I'm immediately applying to job corps to catch up on the years of school I'm behind on, but I'm mainly going to be able to get out of this environment asap. But I'm still very worried because the ONE disease I'm having anxiety about is of course the most rare incurable disease out there, Prions. Please don't click off yet. I'm not an idiot, I realize how rare this disease is. But my environment that consists of being a very unsanitary farm with dog and cat feces and urine present in and outside the house constantly, unvaccinated animals, AND irresponsible parents that don't feed COWS we have correctly, which is literally where you most commonly get prions from an environment, my fears are atleast valid. My arm has been twitching recently sometimes, and body twitching is a symptom so obviously I'm even more worried. And my memory is lowkey bad. The house is so fucking filthy. And since we don't have fixed cats and dogs, there is literally dog period blood just on the floor as I'm walking around the house. And since the many big dogs we have in the house are untrained, we let them use the bathroom on 4 puppy pads that are washed in the washer we all use for laundry. I'm so uncomfortable I don't touch anything outside of my own room without washing my hands. I only eat the food I prepare so I make sure everything that touches it is clean, and I genuinely don't feel hopeful or happy for the future. I'm convinced I'm going to die before I get to leave this place. I'm pretty convinced there's a chance I have prions, and I'm just hoping if I do the incubation period is long enough so after turn 18 I can go get tested and see if I can test if I have prions so I can begin treatment before prions start to damage me, but with how long I've been living in this place, I feel like I'm going to start dying soon. I get it's rare. 1/6000 people get it. But living in an environment like this, irresponsible parents, plus with cows getting into coops/and maybe being fed the wrong food that's not specifically for cows, I don't see how I won't be the 1/6000. I'm probably not going to stop worrying about prions until I get tested, but until then, I hope anyone here can give me some good news that's something other than \"it's rare.\" Yes, it's rare, for normal households. Not to mention, lots of animals have died here before due to unfixed cats having kittens that have died, and a few months back, the kitten was eaten in half in the garage by the other cats or kittens for whatever reason. I guess because it was dying. And I buried it. For all I know now the cats got prions from eating their own kind, and there are prions on the garage floor. There's also plenty of feces in the garage floor in some places. We don't have a proper composting situation so if any of our poultry dies, it's exposed to the dogs, so my mom started just throwing in the field. The same field the fucking cow eats grass from. ",

Initially started on 5 mg three times a day, but in reality I was taking it 1-2 times a day as it was doing very little for me. So I followed up with my PCP and we increased to 10 mg twice a day, and at my next follow up in February maybe, my GAD scores dropped so much and I felt so much better.\n\nNow, a month or two later, I feel exactly the same as I did before I started buspar. I have no idea what to do. Has this happened to anyone else? Do I try a different med? Do I increase my dose? I have taken lexapro before but I really don’t like how it made me feel more numb than normal. Like yes my anxiety was better but I was only feeling 50% of myself, if that makes sense. So I’d rather stay off SSRIs I think. But I also can’t keep feeling like this either. \n\nOther things to note- I do have PRN Xanax which works great but I use that sparingly. I’m also in therapy typically bimonthly right now. ",

We have only been on 4 dates but we text every day.\n\nHowever, my anxiety is still there, I worry I will butcher it up, that he will suddenly lose interest, he will go for the kiss and I will turn away from the anxiety etc.\n\nSo naturally I browse Reddit to distract myself when it gets a bit too much😆. People there often write that when they met the \"the one\", they immediately felt connected and at ease with this person. The conversation flowed naturally and it felt like they have know this person for years etc etc.\n\nOn the other hand, many people write that if you still feel anxious and on edge after a few dates, he probably isn't the one.\n\nNow I'm pretty sure that for someone with anxiety, particular social anxiety like me, the experience will be vastly different.\n\nI can't really tell whether the anxiety is a gut feeling that he isn't the one, or just your regular butterflies so many people tell you about. I can't decipher the signals my body is sending.\n\nSo I thought I would ask here, what was it like when you first started dating your partner?\n\nObviously I know everyone is different, so I'm not looking for an advice or guideline, I'm just interested in your experience.

    "body": "Hey everyone, for background I (21m) am a retired American football player who was forced to stop playing due to concussions. My last concussion was last November, so I haven’t played or done a ton of working out since then. I usually played at about 265 pounds which is on the lower end for football players at my position, but after being concussed I gained 20 pounds, partly due to the depression of not being able to play any more and also partly because I was still eating like I was a full time athlete. Now that it’s been a while, I wanted to start losing weight and getting back into shape. To do that, I did what I’ve always done; run. I typically run 2.5-3 miles a day at about a 8.5-9 minute pace. Since I haven’t run in a while, I can’t really match that pace now. Prior to injury, my heart rate would get into the 170s and 180s while running and would get back to a resting rate of 55-65 an hour or two later. Now when I run my rate gets to the 180s and even 190s if I really push myself, and it takes so much longer to get back down to resting. This is where the anxiety comes in (diagnosed a few months ago officially but I’ve had it forever). My heart rate stays at around 100-110 bpm for a few hours after running, and sometimes takes till the night time to get back down to the 60s for resting. This makes my anxiety pretty bad, and I was just looking for advice to A. Make sure that that can be normal for heart rate to do that, B. Advice for managing the anxiety due to it, and C. How to get back into shape despite it being difficult to because it takes me so long to recover. ",

    "body": "Sorry in advance for a ramble and a vent. TLDR at bottom.\n\nFirstly I think I've struck gold with my current T, considering the horror stories I've heard about the NHS Mental Health Teams. He is gentle, kind, professional, has a good sense of humour, serious about his job, and very approachable. He also has this great approach where; it's CBT, but he does a lot of counselling tier reflection and mindfulness too. This works great for me.\n\nYes, I have some very obvious transference. Originally, this was paternal, however now we have spoke about it and my other attachment issues, I am back to seeing him more as just a therapist, but one I wish I could keep long term and really value. Not sure if that's any better but... 😅\n\nAnyway, I have 4 sessions left before therapy has to end. Truthfully knowing that is absolutely killing me. That one little hour each week is time I truly value, find important, has been a god send for me and my anxiety (which was absolutely crippling prior to starting this therapy.) I've now got a great relationship with my T, loads I want to explore, but feel restricted knowing that end date is looming.\n\nI just don't know how to make this ending feel any easier. I am going to discuss it again with him (we have briefly before and he has reassured me if I ever need to refer back into the service, I can) but it's just one of those things where I don't want that. I wish I could just continue with him until I was ready to go (Though I know the NHS doesn't do this). I feel like every single time I do therapy, more issues get brought up, and then I'm left trying to handle them alone, until it gets too much and I have to go through therapy, transference, and grief all over again. (Yes, I have had these feelings prior, but nowhere near this intense.)\n\nI know I should be able to do it alone, but having that one person that helps and encourages you each week, and gives you the tools to succeed in helping yourself, along with the reassurance you're using them correctly is great for me. How on earth can I get over this feeling of looming grief?\n\nDebating just going private because I truthfully think a therapist helps ground me a lot. Is this a negative way of thinking though?\n\n*TLDR: Therapy is ending, it stings because I like my therapist a lot, and not sure how to deal with it ending. Want long term therapy but unsure if it's a good idea.*",

I also had watery diarrhea and frequent urination. My BP was low, and I legit thought I was dying.

Then, out of nowhere, I woke up at 5 AM (despite sleeping late) with my heart racing and feeling dizzy again.

    "body": "Long story here (18M). About 2 months ago i had a bad experience with THC. I've been at uni for the last year and smoked occasionally with my flatmates nothing heavy had 1g each a couple of times but never felt dependant on it at all. Then my friends brought a 1000mg THC vape before this i had taken some of my friends perscribed ritalin because he claimed it would make me 'lock in' then about 5hrs later had his vape about 5 takes but as im not an experience smoker they were bad inhales and somewhat painful i was thinking about this pain and my friends somewhat taking the piss when suddenly Im hit with intense fear and paranoia i thought i was having a heart attack because of the pounding heart and full body painful tingles which didnt help and was very distrustful of my friends, this was a painful 4hrs of trying to stay calm but eventually the feeling calmed down and i was fine for the next two weeks until with a different group of friends I tried edibles had 3.5mg split between 10 cookies (i had 3 cookies) i was feeling a bit anxious because of my last experience but once again the high made me super anxious this time i felt it more in my heart and i think looking at my pale reflection bc of fear also made things worse. I had some minor dissosciative hallucinations also but i feel now this was because of anxiety cause by the drug than the drug itself. T\n\nthe next day i felt a bit anxious after waking up but then felt fine until 2 days later when i had a fair amount of vodka on valentines day w my gf. This brought up heart palpatations and fear of heart attack but this time didnt go away i let it rest for a few days while i was home fro reading week but while varying in intensity didnt really go and scared me eventually i went to the hospital after a feeling of not being able to go to sleep and they ran tests on my heart which turned out to be completely fine. After learning this my fear went from physical help to fear of mental health particularly developing psychosis or schizophrenia and i had difficulty sleeping at all.  Ive always somewhat seen scary faces in the dark if i try too but the anxiety made it more scary and vivid it also sometimes felt like my bed was flying. And sometimes felt a bit disosciated form my body. Soon after this however I returned to uni and managed to get some sleep w my gf. It has been over a month now since the worst of my anxiety which was about for a week after i had the edibles but i still dont feel quite right i occasionally have sleepless nights or at least I dont feel like ive properly slept at all (sometimes i do get sleep but feel like I havent) what persists is a physical feeling of slight unease in body and heart and often feeling heavy in mt head. Im not sure where to go from here ive never had long lasting or persistent anxieties in my life before and dont feel like my current anxiety majorly impacts my life but does annoy me and make me uncomfortable especially when alone. Im not currently seeing a therapist because my symptoms dont feel so damaging but i am afraid of things getting worse even though im convinced at this point anxiety is my only issue (but its still unpleasent). \n\nIve decided never to do any drugs again (weed really isn't a safe and fun as ppl think) in my life but alcohol isnt as avoidable even though a hangover now feels alot worse. I also ironically think reading up about things like this online makes the anxiety worse as it makes me fear my symptoms worsening).\n\n Ultimately im just fed up of this anxiety and wondering if anyone who has experienced something similar has any tips or a story of full recovery ( that would make me feel better). I feel like i want to be like my old self even though the idea of imagining my old self probably doesnt help. Thanks",

    "body": "So, it all started around july 2022, I was going to the gym at the time and I was focusing on gaining muscle, and I was doing a pretty good job when it came to fitness and nutrition, until one day I was working out and out of nowhere I felt the urge to throw up and boom a panic attack hit me. I had to go home since I was so worried that I was gonna throw up, I felt immediately better when I got home and when to the gym the next day. but over the coming weeks, I started to feel that I'm losing appetite more and more, I would feel my knees getting weaker, shortness of breath, chest tightness, loss of strength and energy, all these were happening at the same time but I didn't care and went on with my life.  \n3 months later college started again, and immediately on the first day I had a panic attack, a week went by and my anxiety went up so high that nothing entered my stomach for almost 2 days except a couple of glasses of water. I went to a gastroenterologist because I thought it's a stomach issue that i'm having and he did some tests only to find out that everything is in great condition, it was him that told me that I might have anxiety and should think less of my stomach and everything will be better on it's own. for the rest of the semester, i did keep getting better until one day I received a call and a really sad news made it all worse, eventually leading to me getting back to smoking cigarettes.  \nso, it has been more than 2 years and I still have this problem, I don't know if this is long term anxiety? depression? eating disorder? or just some physical problem with my stomach that the doctor couldn't catch.  \nI have lost interest in almost everything, back in the day I wanted to go out everyday, now I go out like 2 times a month and I don't even enjoy these 2 times. when someone asks for going out to eat I would just tell them that I already ate even if I hadn't ate anything for that day. I also lost interest in going to the gym since I don't have the energy to lift weights.   \nbefore all this started, I was completely healthy, and nothing major happened in my life except that I went to jail in June 2022 but got out after 2 days when they found out I'm innocent. but now it feels like everything in my life was a mistake, I'm always thinking about things that happened like 8 years ago and worry that it might come up again, not to mention that my past mistakes always haunt me.  \nI do want to mention that thankfully this condition did not affect my sleeping, but almost everything else in my life is affected. I would like to hear from you guys and if anyone else had an experience like this before and how did you manage to overcome it?   \n",

But I still occasionally cause myself a jolt of adrenaline when I'm unsure about a supplement I've taken, etc. For a split second I'll think I'm having trouble swallowing or can't breathe properly, and it'll trigger a big jolt of adrenaline, then I'll start to feel kinda spaced out. I calm myself down with logic - you're fine, you can breathe, etc, but it's such a horrible feeling and leaves me feeling strange.  \n  \nI want to get a handle on this, but am trying to work out exactly what you'd call it - is it a mini panic attack?

Two trips to the ER and all my cardiac and neuro tests came back normal. Fast forward to last summer when I was put on blood pressure meds because of high BP readings at the doctors office. Ever since I started the meds I get much more frequent \"attacks\" and they seem to come out of nowhere. Symptoms are lightheadedness, feeling like I have a mask on with numbness around my eyes, heart palpitations and shaking hands. The numbness, heart palpitations and shaking hands go away after a bit but the lightheadedness can linger on and off for a couple of days. My doctor also prescribed 10 mg propranolol as needed. I also notice it's very heightened when I'm in a crowded situation. \nCan anxiety come on out of nowhere with no obvious triggers?? I'm just so tired of feeling like this.

I was taking 40mg Propranolol before as PRN but it only really helped physical symptoms. I am diagnosed with ADHD, but not medicated. \n\nI took my first dose this morning, after being really anxious that it would make me worse, and feel like crap. Actually I’m pretty chill, my brain is quiet and I’m happy just to relax rather than feel like I constantly have to  find stuff to do - I’m liking this. But my head is heavy and I kinda feel like I do when I sleep in for too long. It’s ok today because I don’t have to do much, but if this feeling continues I think it will be hard to go to work. Thankfully I’m off work for a few weeks now. \n\nI was wondering what people’s experience is of this medication and whether the dopey symptoms ease off after a while? I don’t have much experience of MH related medication as I’ve tried to hold off being medicated for as long as possible but things just got too bad. I know it takes a while to work properly but I don’t really have any experience of what that feels like \nThanks in advance :)",

    "body": "So initially I just went in for propranolol. Really bad shaking, sweating, and fast heartbeat during presentations. Heard about propranolol and I had to jump through a bunch of hoops to get this medication. Went to doctor, doctor didn’t want to prescribe it and sent me to the er, er sent me to a therapist, therapist sent me to the psychiatrist. After months, I finally got it (still haven’t used it) and I was surprised when I found out I’d also been prescribed Zoloft. \n\nHe didn’t really tell me why, he just told me the side effects and all that. Honestly, I took it for 5 days and stopped. I felt like I couldn’t breathe properly, started coughing like crazy, and was barely eating. \n\nHe said he wanted to see me every month and I changed my appointment because I’m worried I’ll get dropped when I tell him I haven’t been taking Zoloft. I guess I just thought I didn’t need it? That and it being a drug just freaked me out. I’m 18 for context and I have no history of depression, just some anxiety that peaks when I have a presentation, on a daily basis it’s obviously still there but manageable. \n\nSo what exactly could Zoloft do for me? I hate the idea of taking drugs, even if it’s just prescription medicine. I do get anxious when interacting with new people, in new situations and sometimes I shake a little, could Zoloft really get rid of all of this? or should I just continue trying exposure therapy? I felt that exposure therapy has helped me improve a little bit, but I’m still on the fence about giving Zoloft a shot since I know it takes quite a while for it to actually start working. I guess I’m also a bit embarrassed about taking Zoloft. If my dad’s side of the family ever found out, I’d never hear the end of it. \n\nAlso, I’m sosososo sorry for the rant, I just don’t really have anybody to ask this to, thank you! ",

I'm an openly gay man and I always felt connected to Buck, but now...I feel more connected to him?

That was a year ago and I honestly didn't think anything of it. I chalked it up to a coincidence and I wasn't sure what had caused it the day. In the show, they broke up and it seems like they are going to have him fall for who most people, myself included, wants him to be with, Eddie. But this past episode, he hooked up with Tommy and I felt uncomfortable? Not panic, but it did open my eyes to being like \"Why am I upset he's hooking up with Tommy?\" I feel like...protective of him? Maybe it's that I see myself in him and I want him to be with Eddie so it hurts not getting that for him? I am also having this realization while I type so it's partially a stream of consciousness. Maybe it's more of a protective thing too?\n\n  \nI don't know, I just get anxious and overwhelmed sometimes about his character and it's really hard to put it into words. I am planning to talk to my therapist about it, but I wanted to just see if anyone has experienced this or something like this? ",

There are periods when i am feeling better and then there are periods where it gets really, really bad and really hard to deal with. To make long story short, i’ve been mostly fine until few months ago when mostly thanks to my gastric issue my anxiety returned. I’ve been having heart palpitations and what feels like fluttering in my diaphragm and left side, sensations that feel like a heartbeat skips and staying out of breath for a second. Went to few doctors and they said that it’s because of my eating, weight and gastric issues. I would have almost constant acid, sour feeling in the mouth, burping, pain in the stomach, left side and even upper back… But like i said it started getting worse.\nOne thing that i can’t figure out is this sudden tingling sensation i get, usually on the left side of my head/scalp. I am not sure should i, but i am connecting this to my stomach/left side issues and i feel like it somehow comes from there (large intestine?) and is giving me this sudden sensation usually on the same, left side of my head. It doesn’t seem to be a single spot, sometimes it will be more on the front left part, sometimes in the back and it lasts for few seconds. I feel like i usually get it if i have a coffee and when i am being anxious and having this weird feeling in my head and eyes area.\n\nI know that this might sound maybe strange to some of you, but i just wanted to ask was anyone ever dealing with something similar and what can i do to figure out what is the cause of this exactly. Like i said, i am also very anxious and dealing with other issues too, like sinuses, heart palpitations, panic attacks that i am trying to deal with but my main problem have been gastric and stomach issues that have been going for too long and that i guess are also getting much worse thanks to my anxiety and stress.

Celebrate small victories along the way.\nFor instance, if you're afraid of networking, your ladder might\nlook like this:\nStep 1: Make eye contact and smile at a stranger.\nStep 2: Say \"hello\" to someone new.\nStep 3: Start a short conversation with a colleague.\nStep 4: Attend a small networking event and introduce\nyourself to one person.\nStep 5: Speak to multiple people at a large networking\nevent.",

I’m really out of shape and i’m overweight. The reason i’m worried is because my heart rate has stayed at around 110-120 the past five hours. I keep telling myself it’s probably because I exerted myself (which I never, ever do. I’m very sedentary.) but i’m worried this could be something serious.

I’m not usually filled with this much anxiety and I don’t understand why I have this pressure in my head. I’ve also been scared of going to sleep due to me thinking I’ll have a seizure in my sleep(I have no history of seizures) or I wont wake up. I feel shorted breathed when I walk up hills or at work and I classify myself as a fit guy (Play sports, Go gym, work a hands on job, etc). I’ve been thinking this could be some sort of brain tumour due to the sudden feeling of anxiety and the pressure in my head and my jaw all the time out of nowhere. I also have been less hungry. But then I’m scared if it is a brain tumour that I’ll die young. Last night i had been worrying a lot about the pressure and I was googling about brain tumours in the shower then out of nowhere I felt so nauseous and felt as if my ears blocked up it honestly felt as if i was going to faint. When i went vomit i just gagged and nothing came out. I’m going to talk to a doctor about this and see if i can get MRI scans but i just feel like if I do that and nothing bad comes up I’ve just wasted my time and my parents were right about it being “just nothing” I don’t get why I feel like this all of a sudden I miss when i would live without a worry in my life.

I almost always feel faint or out of breath anytime something happens. I’m always shaking.\n\nAs I’ve gotten older, it’s been manifesting physically a lot harder. I have got tunnel vision before (that has not happened in a while) and my more common one in recent time is nightmares. I hate that it comes out of nowhere. I never know when it will happen and it impacts how well I sleep.\n\nA few times I have had an entire anxiety attack and I spiral. I can’t breathe. My mind doesn’t feel like my own. It’s like I can’t even reason with myself. I have been alone each time it’s happened. Sometimes (during times something bad happens), I will even have a nightmare and then wake up in the middle of the night with an anxiety attack.\n\nThis also tends to increase when something bad happens in my life. Yesterday, my boyfriend broke up with me ‘out of the blue’ (I had some issues with him myself and I was even thinking of leaving him, so it was a shock but not a surprise we didn’t make it). This is why I’m trying to seek more help. In the past, I have got very depressed and had so much anxiety about myself when it came to the guys I had feelings for. I don’t think I will let it get to a bad point, I just want to manage my pain in a healthy way.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice that can help? I am going to be seeking a therapist here soon because I am interested in medication. But, I want to also learn some coping mechanisms so I don’t have to fully rely on medication.",

I'm trying to go on walks & exercise more before starting, but I'm horribly unfit [like winded going up a small set of stairs or checking the mail unfit] & while once I'm there I'll be in one spot, the bus stop-->where I'll be working is [for me] a super long walk so I'm really anxious about not being able to walk that [again I am exercising now to try & lessen it, but since I'm so horribly unfit I'm worried what I'm capable of doing now won't heavily effect that]\n\n2: Bus. I've been on the bus before so ik how the process works but I'm very anxious & paranoid. I'm anxious that I'll miss my stop[s? I haven't checked the routes yet so idk if I'll need only one bus or several] but the MAIN part I'm worried about & ik this is extreme, is I'm worried about getting killed or kidnapped or something off the bus, especially since some of my shifts will be late getting off [& some of my shifts someone could probably meet me at the bus stop on the way home/walk me to it before work, but most of them, like my first day, that won't be an option because it'll clash w/ their work]. Plus as paranoid as I am I'm weirdly not a very Aware person, so I feel like unfortunately I maybe wouldn't notice if I was being followed [or my brain would go \"I'm being paranoid this is probably a normal everyday person who happens to go the same way\" which in 99% of cases would be fine cause that'd be the case but I'm worried I'll do that when it's not the case]\n\n3: That I won't be able to handle it. It's my first job & during the talks & stuff they asked if I've ever worked & they were nice & said \"Don't worry thats fine, we'll train you [place I work] is a good place for a first job\" & ik someone who works there & she likes it there, but still. I'm worried that first week or two I'll be fired [or so stressed I'll quit, which I don't wanna do I need a job & the pay is good, but I'm still worried].\n\nSorry if this makes no sense. Basically I'm asking for advice on how to alleviate these anxieties, if any of y'all have any tips on certain aspects [like advice for going out alone for the first time, first time bus rider tips to make the experience less daunting, etc] ?\n\nOh & this isn't an anxiety thing, but for folks who get really car sick, is bus rides the same [like just as car sick on a bus as in a car] or is it better [bus rides less sick than cars] or worse ? I get super car sick so I wanna know if I'd probably be good to just go as is or if I should try & look into car sick treatment",

Suddenly last night I ate this greasy chinese food and started getting them,  Shrugged it off and they kept coming and coming.. every 10 mins every five mines again 40 mins later.  All random intervals and they feel terrible.  Pop, flips twisting, stuttering.. i hate the feeling.  This continued all night into today and i decided to go to the ER.  they gave me an EKG,  chest xray, blood work, urine,  and i was on a monitor that wasn't being recorded unfortunately because i probably had dozens.     The heart doctor said they told him about the EKG and if all the other tests are normal to send me home and I will follow up with him.  I am pretty sure he said he saw a couple of PVC's on the EKG.  I know these are the bad types so I am worried that all these feelings I been getting are all PVC's.   It was hell trying to sleep or finding a position where they would stop,  but it seemed like no matter what I did i would still get them. .  I am still get into it now .. they come and go well over 24 hours.. Anyone get anything like this or have any advice?",

Every time it’s quiet, my boss will come up to me and start talking about how I would let people walk all over me and that I’m a pushover.

Recently, a colleague pointed out in front of everyone that my lip was quivering when he kept taunting me about how I’m testing patients tomorrow, and I just wanted to die from embarrassment.\n\nBut it gets worse. He talks about me behind my back to others, calling me a doormat, and I hear it all the time. It’s humiliating. He once told me that if he told me to face the wall for 10 minutes, I would, and that I’d let people take advantage of me. I feel so extremely embarrassed, and it’s making me dread going into work every day.\n\nThe worst part is that the truth is, I’m not like this at all. I do stand up for myself if I’m being wronged, but he’s instilled so much fear in me that I freeze every time he tells me off, and that just makes him angrier. He mocks and mimics my reactions, like when I freeze up or get nervous, and he gets mad when I have nothing to say. He tries to make me sound so pathetic in front of everyone, and I feel small and helpless when that happens.\n\nI’m always scared to go into work, knowing he’s going to pick on me. It’s seriously affecting my mental health, and I feel trapped. This is my first job, and I’m struggling on how to navigate this. We don’t have HR, so I’m at a loss for what to do.

A few weeks ago, I was to have surgery and was given Triazolam with laughing gas to sedate me enough for IV sedation, and it caused a severe negative reaction. I experienced hallucinations of a paradoxical reality within the duality, and other visuals I have a hard time describing other than I was actively tripping as if I had taken some sort of psychedelic drug. It was awful. I did not have the surgery because I was hostile, and unwilling to cooperate (don't remember that), and now have the new surgery coming up.   \n  \nI am completely traumatized. That event was so deeply triggering that I don't know how to cope with the reality that it may happen again. Now, I have rationalized it (to the best of my capabilities). The medical staff provided a benzodiazepine (something I cannot have), and the mixture of gas definitely didn't help. I'm in the process of seeking out testing to see what medications are viable for pre-med sedation, and I hope the results ease some of this weight, but I had found out all pre-op IV-sedatives are benzo's....

I have the impression that my problem is entirely psychological, especially because before taking Ritalin, I had to undergo an ECG and a blood test, and my heart is in very good condition.  \n  \nMoreover, when I exercise, my heart doesn't give me any problems; on the contrary, I feel a sense of well-being, and if there were an issue with my heart, I doubt I would be able to regain my composure and calm down.\n\n  \nIf anyone has had an experience similar to mine, particularly sudden intolerance to caffeine, your testimony is welcome.  \n  \nThanks anyway for reading this wall of text.",

She tries to encourage me, my husband calls for encouragement (blessed, he doesn’t get upset with me or mad), I try to encourage myself. But the idea that I had already been up for 24 hours + had a 15 hour flight alone..my thoughts were racing. \n\nAll night I had been having other physical symptoms of anxiety/panic and they hadn’t really stopped. I ended up not boarding my flight. \n\n\nI’m SO disappointed. Not in the fact that I didn’t go, but in the fact that I think the way I think and that it gets in the way of so many things. I do not think I would’ve had a good flight or day once I landed because of the anxiety and sleep and time change added on with such the long flight. I just am not sure I’m in the right headspace for that right now. \n\nThere is a possibility of me flying in next week with my in laws, but even so, I’m not sure I feel comfortable. \n\n\nI’m doing an extra therapy session this coming week to get my therapist’s opinion. I also had children’s melatonin that I think I should try out sometime this week, but also have a fear of trying new meds.😅\n\nI don’t wish anxiety or panic on ANYONE. I beg to have happier, more pleasant thoughts. Please send me prayers, good thoughts, good vibes. This is tough. Thank you in advance.",

    "body": "I was prescribed Xanax/Alprazolam over a year ago PRN (as needed) for insomnia related to anxiety. Now, thankfully through therapy my therapist and I have developed non-pharmacological ways to help me go to sleep on rough nights, but the Xanax is a great emergency button on the few nights where nothing else works. I end up taking 2mg maybe 2-4 times a month. It works great for what it's supposed to do, it makes me sleepy and calms my mind and body and I get a great night of sleep after. What I immediately noticed though is that alongside those wonderful effects, my body also gets really heavy and uncoordinated and I start stumbling around like I'm drunk which normally is fine because I'm only ever taking it right before bed but my biggest continued issue is that the next day and for the following 24 hours the mental sedative effects have totally cleared but my body is still super uncoordinated and heavy feeling. It's gotten to the point where I am really hesitant to take the medication even when I need it because that heavy uncoordinated feeling is really disruptive to my day the next day and it doesn't look or feel great when I'm trying to go around town and get things done while looking like I've been getting blasted on morning mimosas. My questions are as follows: 1. Has anyone else dealt with this before? 2. Is my dose just too high? I'm a bigger girl and the 0.25 and the 0.5mg doses did absolutely nothing for my acute anxiety so my psych suggested to go for something more heavy duty 3. Is there a way to mitigate that heavy body feeling?   \n\n  \nMy disclaimer at the end is that I would like to clarify that I am legally prescribed this medication and am under active treatment by a psychiatrist so please don't PM me about how/where to get the medication. I am also fully aware of all the negative sides of benzo usage and I am not really looking to be lectured about that at this time, thank you!!",

I have both anxiety and depression and involved in weekly therapy sessions and on medication for the anxiety, depression and insomnia issues currently. Prescribed Zoloft and Trazadone. I have had a history of anxiety and depression for years now  however, I am currently being treated for very deep personal trauma related issues. I do however believe however that this phobia was present years ago but, I never really acknowledged it as a true phobia or problem but, it seems to be much worse now especially with the increased anxiety type issues. I struggle to sleep at night, my mind races constantly and endlessly for hours it seems. Negative Provoking thoughts mostly or fixations on the negatives that have happened within my past. While I am in bed, this fear or phobia you might say creeps up on me. It's terrible! I think that I may be bleeding from somewhere on or in my body. I will get up and check my mouth or on my skin in the bathroom mirror obsessively multiple times over the course of a couple hours sometimes. It's always this fear of blood. I don't understand it at all honestly. I don't have an actual fear of blood itself it's just this specific issue. Can anyone relate to this or know what may be the direct link of this phobia? It's kind of like an OCD issue especially considering I check multiple times for the reassurance. I am going to address this with my therapist next week as well. I just wanted to reach out and see if anyone else here has had a similar experience. ",

    "body": "Hi there, I've noticed an uptick in my anxiety since the new year and in the last month, I've been living in a constant-state of rumination about memory loss. This ultimately was triggered by me trying to recall when I got off my Prozac last year and when I couldn't remember the specifics, I had a full blown panic attack (roughly 3 weeks ago). I was on 30 MG Prozac for 3 years to treat a similar rumination pattern that was diagnosed as GAD and DPDR. I got off the medication last April because I felt that my symptoms had improved and the medication was unnecessary. I can't recall if my memory was poor at that time, but I was so fixated on my consciousness that I don't think I cared much to be insightful about my memory. Since then, I've been hyper analyzing my memory. I'm a server and since I've returned to work from my vacation, I will look at regulars and wonder the last time I spoke to them and what we discussed (essentially intrusive thoughts) and I will feel physical anxiety if I can't recall. I don't rememember telling people things during this time, and recently recalling longterm memories has been a challenge as well. When I'm not actively thinking about memory, I feel really \"brain foggy.\" I'm curious to know if anyone else struggles with OCD-type rumination about memory and if anxiety also impacts their longterm memory as well? I understand anxiety can impact short term and working memory, but I'm starting to fear my memory will start to progressively get worse and worse. I have a doctors appt. Next month and a couple therapist appts. Established to help me work through this. But PLEASE anyone who struggles with memory and have gotten through it or have any advice please let me know. I'm really worried I have some undiagnosed brain damage or disease. ",

Like I could be driving my car, and it’s small things like seeing something dead on the side of the street, and my mind spirals, I am constantly playing out how that something may have died, wondering if it suffered, feeling horrible for hours. Then on the other hand it could be over someone telling me to “chill” if I start to get a little “worked up” about something and then I’m thinking “ I wonder if they think I am annoying” or “god I do need to chill I sound crazy” etc and i feel like these issues I’m having are so by the book and super common but they feel so suffocating. It’s either I’m feeling intense feelings of dread and despair, normally something sad that’s triggered me (like what I see when driving) or I’m feeling super high strung and paranoid of what people think of me, if I’m too annoying or if I was rude when I said something to a coworker etc. I have been on Wellbutrin for a while and I can’t really say if it has helped at all? Like anytime my doctor asks me how I like the Wellbutrin, I genuinely cannot give an answer because I simply just don’t know. I went to my doctor for a med check recently and he had me try vraylar, and I think I liked it, but it made me SO nauseous I couldn’t continue with it. Am I going crazy? My doctors are so quick to change my meds easily. I’m also on 60mg of adderall for my ADHD. I’m not sure if that’s even good for me, I’m scared I’m going to get heart disease, or some sort of heart problems (I’m not a medical professional so if this is irrational then don’t judge). I also think the adderall aids in my anxiety and makes it worse but it’s all my insurance will cover. I’ve been considering stopping my meds, but also I’m scared to do that. I just don’t know. ",

    "body": "Hello! \n\nSo I have the type of anxiety where my stomach will start hurting and the urge to go to the bathroom is like crazy.\n\nI've been to gastrologists, I've been to two different therapists, and I've told my doctor. I was told it was probably IBS, after they tried all the tests they could including colonscopy and endoscopy, but they havent officially diagnosed me and the medication they give me doesn't work. Fiber doesnt work. Nothing is helping me with these panic attacks I get. \n\nBecause I don't panic until I feel that urge to go. The cramping of my stomach and the diarrhea that needs to urgently come out.\n\nI've tried breathing, which works 1 in 10 times, and I've tried the 5 senses rule. I've tried talking to keep myself occupied. Nothing works.\n\nI feel like Im going to explode from the inside. I have to exhale dramatically sometimes because it gets too much. I need a bathroom and sometimes it's not always there which freaks me out even more. I immediately go walking because I can't just stand still and sitting makes it worse. \n\nIt's 50/50 chance that when I do reach a bathroom, I will use it. Panic doesn't go away when I do unless it's alot. If I don't use it, it won't leave me alone until I reached my destination or I'm home. I spend about an hour everyday on the toilet because it does eventually come out if I have something there and if nothing comes out, it reassures me that I'm empty. But if it's too early, like 3 am to 7 am, I am not reassured at all. It's too early to have a bowel movement and spending an hour on the toilet won't work in those hours.\n\n I have woken at 5 once, spent a very long time waiting on the toilet but nothing came out, went outside, and as soon as I stopped at a bus stop my stomach was hurting and I had to use it really bad. I panicked and walked back and forward because moving helps me but it wouldn't go away so I ended up breaking down. I spent an hour and 20 minutes in agony of stomach pain, the urge to use the bathroom, and the feeling of needing to breathe more until I eventually got up and went back home. As soon as I got home and went on the toilet, absolutely nothing came out. \n\nIt happens if it's too early in the morning. I say 95% of the time it happens if I'm outside before 10 am. The remaining time is if I eat alot or I eat something spicy or greasy and I go outside immediately after. It always happens when I'm outside or when I'm home and someone's in the bathroom at the moment. It is ruining my life, I have so many events that require me to be early. I hate letting everyone down. \n\nI tried dieting in January. I thought it worked but just 2 days ago I had an attack again and I started crying. I had the urge to run and I was just nearly seconds away from screaming at the bus driver to let me off. It didn't go away even when I arrived at my doctors appointment at 9:30 am. Stomach kept cramping and I kept running to use the bathroom but I was still nervous because I couldn't spend my time in there because patients would need it for urine samples.\n\nSo I know the reason behind them. I'm terrified of soiling myself. The humiliation, shame, and the stares would be horrifying. It'll never leave me alone. And I hate when people tell me to just let it happen. It won't make it all go away. I am seriously considering adult diapers. At 23 years old. \n\nI'll add somethings that might or might not be relevant: I used to be terrified of toilets growing up. I would soil myself at home because of how scared I was. I would also have many bowel movements that were hard as stone and huge. I was told it was because I didn't drink enough water.\n\nI have some aunts and a grandparent with issues of panic attacks. None of them have the urge to use the bathroom though.\n\nThis all started from food poisoning when I was 19. I ate everything my siblings ate except for this Dunkin Donuts Coffee. I believe that's what made me sick because I spent an entire week in agony with urges to go and stomach pain. I went to a doctor and I forgot what he told me but I recieved no help.\n\nI just need some advice. What has worked for anyone with a similar issue? Should I try anxiety meds? I have no support and my therapist and Doctors just tell me to eat better but that's what I've been doing!! \n\n\n",

I think this is what might have started my anxiety problem. From then on, I understood that not everyone comes back when they leave, and the uncertainty of it all made me crack. \nBut that’s not what I wanted to talk about. My family keeps stray cats. We always have, I’m used to it all but the important thing here is that my dad and stepmom believe that cats should be able to go outside and roam. And before you say anything I’ve had many many fights and talks about it with them and they are pretty stubborn on it. With that you might imagine I’ve lost many cats. And I loved each one of them. Each one was a friend, and a hope that this time they’ll stay with me, only for them to go missing, or drown, or get hit by a car. The longest I’ve had a cat was probably something close to 3 years. And that hurt. Anyways, because of this I’ve started subconsciously linking cats to death. When I see videos of kittens all I can think of is „death, they will die soon” which I think is some sort of mechanism to not get attached, and to prepare for the thing that my life has taught me will happen. \nEither way - if anyone has any tips on how I could undo this cycle… please share. I want to be able to look at a cat and not think about it being hit by a car immediately. ",

    "title": "My Own Worst Enemy",
    "body": "Well. I suppose a lot of people new to this sub have a longer backstory than can be put into one post. But here goes mine in short form. \n\nI (M28) have been dealing with terrible anxiety, centric around romantic relationships, since my very first one, as a highschool sophomore. Undoubtedly, it stems from huge fears of rejection, and my mother not being in my life from 6th grade, until I became a 22 year old homeowner. As well as a divorce with the mother of my one son. \n\nI'm a people pleaser with mommy issues and a bad image of how marriage ends. \n\nFast foreward to last year, my current relationship (F27) was going down the tubes, and we suffered from a dead bedroom. A failed attempt at opening the relationship, residual feelings and hidden text messages from the people we tried to connect with, and a near breakup, left my trust broken a bit and left me with panic attacks about being left or cheated on. But she met with an online therapist often enough, and is on medication for anxiety/trauma. I started therapy in the summer time and from there, we grabbed the shock paddles, jumpstarted the heart, and learned what it would take to keep this relationship alive. \n\nLately, things have been looking up, panic attacks are infrequent/non-existent and we're reclaiming our bedroom, reclaiming our own free time, and our wonderful relationship, step by step, slowly but surely. \n\nAt the begining of this week, we found ourselves in the mood to send each other nude and nude adjacent pictures. Couldn't have been more excited. And then she sent a picture, that was taken a while back, when she was just feelin herself and wanted to take a hot picture, but it was definitely taken from our bed, at night time, and she sent it to me during the daytime, while she was out on the road. And BOOM. A terrible anxious spiral overcame me and I was thrown back into last summer where every move, every text, every thing that she did, and didn't tell me about or explain was a personal attack. I was SURE that she took it a calendar year ago and recycled it to me to humor the situation. \n\nI waited a good 3 days to gain some mental clarity and have a session with my therapist. And last night I thought I found the best way to ask her, (not accuse her) of when the picture might have been taken and if I was the only one who saw it. And she still got very hurt and insulted that I would ever assume she would do that to me. Reasonable. But. I also felt like I could never bring my problems to her,  without her becoming the victim and assuming I see her as pure evil. \n\nNow I'm just mad that I was gaslighting myself and may have ruined or perhaps, reset my chances of sending racy pictures, and I don't know how to make her feel like A: I still love the idea of nudes, B: I definitely didn't feel that way, from a place of malice, but more out of fear. But also C: I still feel heard and respected when I bring her an \"I feel\" statement about a certain event. \n\nTL;DR long history of relationship centered anxiety. Received a nude-ish picture that didn't sit right with me, due to said anxiety, and tried to respectfully explain why I came home from work in a panicked state. It turns out I gaslit myself into thinking she was cheating and now I feel dumb and she feels insulted. I hope I didn't ruin my chances of getting more pics. ",

I am terrified of trying to build new relationships and feel the urge to hide because of the *potential* judgement over one thing or another.\n\nI’m also scared to cause conflict (which I know is normal and healthy) because I’m afraid the person on the other end will not want to work it out with me. 1) I often take it personally and 2) I tell myself that they don’t want to work it out with me because I’m unworthy and maybe I’m just not meant to be in community with others.

    "title": "Weird changing headache for weeks?",
    "body": "So as a background on me, I am a 27 year old male, and I have had pretty bad anxiety issues my whole life, and many in my family have similar issues. This current bout of stress has gradually ruined my sleep and eating, and has caused me like 5 panic attacks a week for like 6 weeks, and some fun depersonalization/disassociation type of stuff, to be totally frank. I was already been under a lot of underlying stress up to this point also. I was hoping to share my experience to get some insight/hear similar stories from others, and maybe some peace of mind from the experience of others that steers me away from worrying that I am dying 24/7. (I do have doctor's appointments lined up also for the record, but I can't talk to my main doc til Monday). Also apologies in advance for how long and rambly this is gonna be; I am trying to paint a complete picture here. I will try to keep this updated as well.\n\nSo here's the scoop. I have been very stressed the past few months especially. It started around the beginning of January when I noticed my left eye had poorer vision than my right eye (particularly at distances and not close up). I keep spending way too much time switching back and forth between my eyes just to make sure it was actually different, and eventually I thought about it less even though I realized my vison was poorer in my left eye. It was kinda hard to notice if I was using both my eyes, so like I eventually just went about my business, but it worries me that I don't know how long it was like that, or how quickly that developed. I also worry about if it is a part of my other symptoms.\n\nGoing forward, the next month I had an incident that was very stress inducing and left me crying for awhile, and I got a headache around my right eye that just didn't seem to want to go away. It was there all night, and before bed it switched to my left eye, but when I woke up it was back in my right eye, and it was in that eye most of the time. Eventually I made an assumption that maybe all my screen time was the cause, so I avoided screens for days. Gradually my head got better, but not 100% better, and the length of the headache stressed me very badly because I have never had a headache last more than a day pretty much. It never went away fully despite feeling pretty alright for like 2 weeks generally speaking. And actually sometimes I felt like sinus burning (but no congestion), and also other times occasionally tooth pain ( I have some cavities I have been getting worked on since I had noticed tooth pains leading up to all this. Also I still have all my wisdom teeth, and sometimes I worry if my upper wisdom teeth which have not popped out could be having issues or something, but I had an x-ray sometime prior, and the dentist didn't seem to notice anything off I guess.\n\nSo then it stayed at that baseline for the next couple weeks, and also sometimes in the middle of the night I'd wake up with the left side of my neck feeling sore, and also feeling a headache in the lower back of my head. This happened a handful of times, but not every time. I also started feeling occasional chest pains (which has happened for me in the past during high stress). I went to the doctor and told them about everything I was dealing with and they didn't seem too worried about the head stuff. They gave me a prescription for Prozac, sent me for bloodwork, and ordered a heart scan. The bloodwork came back fine except for a slightly low bun/creatinine ratio (8), I have yet to do the heart scan, and I haven't touched the Prozac yet because I have been too anxious to try it (plus also I wanted to be able to pay attention to my symptoms and not get side effects mixed up with my symptoms, or worsen my symptoms). I saw an eye doctor and he said my eyes were healthy, but that my left eye has slightly poor vision, and my right eye has astigmatism (OD: Plano spehere, -0.50 cylinder, axis 175. OS: -0.50 sphere, D.S cylinder.), and said I should get glasses to use as needed, but that my vision was mostly fine.\n\nA couple weeks ago now I started feeling a strange pressure at the top of my head that popped up pretty suddenly (feeling something like a vein maybe? it is hard to describe). It came on gradually over like a minute or so, and has been constant ever since I think, but sometimes when I wake up I feel like it might not be there until I start thinking about it, and also I sometimes forget about it when wearing my headset, or like a hat or something. For a few days it had felt like the pressure at the top of my head had a burning sort of sensation as well, but that has gone away since (it did also come back for a short while, but then went away again). Around the 14th and 15th I had a headache when I got up from bed, but one lasted like an hour and was the back and front of my head, and the other lasted a few hours. Lately I have been finding myself feeling nauseous on and off, and occasionally this like dizzy headsick feeling. Sometimes my head feels hot. And here and these I have felt momentary dull pains in my forehead near one eye or the other. Also the past couple days I have been feeling this sort of \"vertigo\" kind of thing where it feels like my surroundings are very slightly moving or shifting or something. The past couple days I have also felt this faint tingling sort of sensation down my left arm into my pinky.\n\nLast night I had gotten myself feeling mostly fine actually, but then I started feeling this weird sensation with my left eyelid where it sort of felt like it was kinda harder to blink very slightly. Like the eyelid skin was getting folded up in a funny way or something Idunno. Was still feeling the weird left arm/hand tingling thing too, and at also for a while last night my left ear was hurting a fair bit (like the ear itself, and not like inside). Yesterday I also thought that my vision overall felt as poor as my left eye for some reason, and I woke up feeling sick today. I tried playing an FPS game for an hour or so, and it felt off visually like the whole time, and then I got quite headsick feeling, but after I stopped playing that got a fair bit better. As I have been writing this I think it has lessened even more actually, and eventually got better. Though now (when I was writing this last night) the right side of my head hurts from like my eyebrow up to the front top of my head, but then as fast as I mention that it kinda chills out. My head does feel hot in this moment also, but I haven't checked my temp at all because I am afraid of seeing a high temperature and triggering another panic attack basically. Another important note for the past like week is my eyes keep feeling sore to the touch basically. Or like if I look around too much or something I will notice it. As of a little bit later also I noticed my left eye feeling sting-y feeling and being sorta watery and also looking red. More recently (like the past day) I have felt an on and off strange sinus pressure sort of dull headache, and had a slightly burning nose, and feeling like my head feels uncomfortably warm. I went to bed at a dumb time and woke up with the top back of my neck feeling achey. Same with my forehead too I guess.\n\nAnywho that's probably the entire story I think. I have just been freaking out about this daily, stressing myself into not eating good enough or sleeping good enough, and it's just been awful really. The head symptoms have been really mild though. The first week my head hurt quite a bit to the point where I was like taking tylenol and using an ice pack for a couple days, If I knew for a fact that I was fine and nothing was wrong with my head, then this would be totally managable, but my anxiety is off the charts and so I have been miserable. I just want to be fine again, but after 6 weeks it feels like this is just my life now until it gets worse, actually for real better, or until I get answers. My mom keeps telling me it's just stress and anxiety because she's had similar (often worse) stuff too, but it's hard to be logical when stuff feels so weird and constant.\n\nShort-ish version: Head issues for like 6 weeks straight. Vision changes a month prior, then mild lingering (changing) headache that started off bad but then mostly got better and now just comes and goes, top of head pressure (sometimes burning), slight vertigo/dizziness, headsick feeling that comes and goes, weird tingling in left arm/hand(left side of left hand), warm feeling head, sinus pressure and burning nose sometimes, eye soreness (strain?), neck pains in the night, and maybe some other stuff, over the course of 6 weeks, and it has had me stressing big time.",

    "title": "Benzo or propranolol for long-haul flight?",
    "body": "Hey everyone\n\nI’ve been dealing with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) for a while now, but through exposure and persistence, I’ve managed to almost completely overcome it. What used to be a debilitating issue, at one point causing agoraphobia, has now become more of a manageable nuisance in daily life. That said, some situations still trigger intense anxiety for me, and one of the worst is flying.\n\nIn less than a week, I’ll be flying alone from Europe to the US. It’s a long-haul flight, and I’m already feeling extremely anxious. What’s frustrating is that for the first 25 years of my life, I had zero issues with flying. This all started about a year ago, seemingly out of nowhere.\n\nOriginally, my anxiety centered around the fear of “going crazy.” Over time, that’s shifted into more generalized social fears, like the fear of embarrassing myself in public, passing out, hyperventilating, or losing control. While on airplanes it is however on a different level. I get intrusive “what if” thoughts like:\n\n\t•\tWhat if I freak out in front of everyone? Causing embarrassment and an unpleasant flight for everyone on board. \n\n\t•\tWhat if I go crazy and try to open the airplane door mid-flight?\n\n\t•\tWhat if I cause the plane to make an emergency landing because of a panic attack? Spoiling everyone’s travel on board.\n\n\t•\tWhat if I become a danger to myself or others?\n\nIt’s not about the plane crashing, I’m not typically scared of that. It’s more the bizarre, surreal nature of being 30,000 feet in the air that triggers a sense of derealization and claustrophobia. Being “trapped” for 9 hours without a clear escape makes everything worse. These thoughts then spiral into each other: the claustrophobia feeds the derealization, which makes me think I’m losing my mind, which spikes my heart rate and creates a full panic loop.\n\nEven though I generally never actually leave a situation even at the onset of panic, I always power through, just knowing that I could leave helps a lot. But on a plane, that safety valve doesn’t exist. That’s what terrifies me.\n\nWhen this all began, my GP prescribed me benzos, but I’ve never taken them. I’ve always preferred to face things head-on through exposure. But now I’m unsure. I’ve read that benzos can help in the moment but might also cause derealization or a rebound in anxiety afterwards and worst case psychosis (my ultimate fear). I’m also hesitant because of my past, between ages 20–23, I used marijuana heavily, almost daily. A year and a half after quitting, this anxiety hit me out of nowhere when I randomly out of nowhere experienced derealization for the first time without knowing what it was. That history makes me fearful of taking anything that alters my state of mind. I still carry a lingering fear of psychosis, even though I’ve never had any signs of it.\n\nSo here I am asking this nice community the following; Do I finally take a benzo just for the flight? Should I try something milder like propranolol? Or just grit my teeth and push through like I would do on ground? Or… should I get drunk before the flight (I know, not ideal, but I don’t drink often either)?\n\nI’m afraid that taking a benzo might make things worse by giving me rebound anxiety as well as derealization for days after during the trip itself, but I also don’t know if I can mentally handle 9 hours in the air in a sensitized state, only to arrive in the US already burned out from the anxiety.\n\nWould love to hear from anyone who’s been through something similar. What worked for you?\n\n———————— \n\nTL;DR:\nFlying triggers intense anxiety for me—claustrophobia, derealization, and intrusive thoughts which raises my adrenaline and makes me ultimately panic. I have a 9-hour flight soon and I’m torn between taking a benzo, asking for propranolol, drinking, or just powering through. Looking for advice from anyone who’s dealt with this.\n\n\n",

    "body": "Disclaimer: I am not a doctor nor do I work in the medical field. However, I have experienced something very interesting and I want to talk about it.\n\nThis entire week has been absolutely crazy for me. I ended up landing in the ER once. I experienced symptoms including but not limited to:\n\n* shortness of breath when standing up\n* chest pain\n* dizziness\n* headaches\n* sweaty palms / feet\n* loss of apetite\n* frequent urination\n* etc\n\nAll of these were kicked off because I noticed shortness of breath over the weekend. Then I got anxious, anxiety produced more symptoms, and I read into those symptoms too much. Then I I went to the ER scared of a heart attack, but everything was fine. In fact doctors said everything is perfect, and it looks like I just had bad anxiety.\n\nA few days pass, most symptoms went away since I stopped reading into them and started ignoring them. One symptom however remained: the one that started it all I can't beat this subjective feeling of shortness of breath. This kicks in more anxiety, etc.\n\nThen browsing some Reddit posts, I saw a link to a study that showed even a slight anterior pelvic tilt can cause difficulty catching one's breath. I was so anxious about it and it not going away, that I was not sure what was wrong with me and started getting really scared. Simply adjusting my posture has already mostly fixed my subjective feeling. Now, I am going to be working on my posture properly.\n\nAnd why would I not have bad posture? I have been working from home sitting like a monkey on my chair for over 3 years since graduating college. \n\nEveryone -- please don't forget about the importance of proper posture and exercise.",

    "body": "So I've made posts talking about how I have chronic hypertension after having a baby in August. Since then it's caused a ton of health anxiety and ptsd which I'm in weekly therapy for. We've been doing exposure therapy where I take my bp with him which helped a lot and will hopefully help me get over my fear of getting my bp taken. I use to see my doctor every 2-4 weeks for bp check ups and medication adjustments but the past 2 I've had, my bp was good so he said to monitor at home from now on. Which I hadn't been able to do since yesterday because my anxiety spikes every time I get it taken. Therapy went well and my bp kept fluctuating between 127/80s and 90s to 150/90 which was the highest it got but then went back down to the 120s. Then I got the courage to take it at home and and it was 110/89 and I felt really happy cuz that's the lowest the top number has been in so long. My usual is in the 120s. Even though my bottom number was a little high, it still made me feel relieved. Then today I got the courage to take it a few times. The first reading I got was great. 127/80. Then I took it a few more times and it just kept going up from there because I was getting more anxious. The last reading I got was 147/76. Bottom number is good but top number was high. This caused me to have a panic attack and I couldn't calm down and I just kept spiraling. I couldn't calm down enough to mediate and do mindfulness so I immediately took a cold shower which seemed to do the calm me down. But now every time I'm anxious, I can't help but think about how high my bp might be. If anyone has any advice or words of encouragement, I'd really appreciate it. Thank you in advance! ",

Not much talking between us, and honestly I don't mind. Car was clean as well!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAbout 20 minutes into our drive I notice he's sort of glancing in the rearview at me like he wants to say something, he starts kind of breathing deep breaths and says: \"Sorry I have to pull over.\" I reply: \"Ok is everything alright?.\" He says \"Sorry having a panic attack.\"\n\nI remained calm and told him, \"Ok that's fine man, I have panic attacks too, I'm not going anywhere important, take your time.\"\n\nLuckily he was able to pullover, we were in a residential area with a hill next to us and side walk.\n\nHe wasn't really speaking much at this point and I told him: \"I know when I have these attacks I like to be alone, don't worry I'm not in a hurry, I'll be over here on the curb playing games on my phone take your time, let me know if you want to call anyone.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAbout 20-30 minutes later, I told him I could drive him the rest of the way so he could finish his trip and make money, he said to give him a few more minutes. He was able to calm down enough to drive us. We arrived fine, I tipped him told him this is my number if he needs to talk with someone with anxiety as well and went on our ways. I think fresh air and giving him space helped him instead of worrying about finishing his trip with me. Anyways just a small story I had today. Cheers",

    "body": "EDIT: WOW! Thank you so much guys for your kind words! I’m in the UK and have just woke up to all of this positivity. I knew reddit was an awesome place but this has just confirmed it even more. We all deserve contentment, thank you so much 💕\n\nSo after years of childhood trauma, anxiety and depression I finally got to a stage where I could afford decent therapy and had my first session today. My therapist seems really nice and her little room was the perfect environment for me to feel comfortable talking.\n\nAt the end she asked me what I wanted from therapy. As I was telling her all about me and my life, I was constantly worried about her thinking I was overreacting, judging my stories or thinking them not serious enough to require therapy and that I was just a weak person. She looked at my blankly and said ‘is it a big deal for you?’ I said, ‘yes, massively’ and she just simply replied ‘well then it’s a big deal...’, and just shrugged her shoulders and started talking about our next session.\n\nHonestly it was like an epiphany. I realised that if something is a big deal in MY universe, then it is a big deal because it’s me that matters and someone else not thinking it’s serious does NOT invalidate that. I’m always so anxious that my problems will seem silly to someone else, but actually if they really care about helping you get through it, they won’t judge the nature of the problem but try and help you through it anyway because they know it’s a serious problem to you. Your problems are all valid and they’re all worth fixing guys, don’t ever forget that xx",

Some of the more mild ones still appear from time to time; I’ll get fatigued or dizzy/foggy maybe once every few weeks, but this happens so infrequently (and becomes less frequent with each occurrence) that it doesn’t really bug me. I was also on medication (an SSRI since day one and a benzo for the first few months) and am in the process of tapering off .\n\nSo I wanted to write a post about how to get over each stage of your anxiety, mainly because I know I really would have appreciated this kind of guidance when I first sought help in late April of last year. If you want a summary of things you can do regardless of what stage you’re at, scroll to the bottom and check the paragraph in bold.\n\nI don’t discuss responses to specific symptoms here, just a general approach. If you’re looking for tactics for specific symptoms, check out the list of books I left in the second section. I think the first one does a particularly good job of addressing every symptom, but you can try the third if you don’t feel it makes enough of a difference.\n\nBefore you read, I want to mention something once so I don’t have to later on. Recovery is going to be like a rollercoaster. Some days you’ll feel like you made incredible progress, and others you’ll have difficulty even doing simple tasks. It’s going to be a lot of two steps forward, one step back. Sometimes it’ll even be two steps forward, two steps back. But even those times are okay, because they serve as proof that you are capable of improving. Just know that once you start to give effort, things will start gradually getting better.\n\nSo here it is. My comprehensive guide to recovering from an anxiety disorder.\n\nIf you’re at a constant 9/10 - 10/10 anxiety and can’t calm down:\n\nAt this stage, you’re either in the middle of panic attack (which lasts up to 60 minutes) or you have GAD and are constantly anxious. I was diagnosed with GAD and Pure-O but I’ve had maaaaaany panic attacks, so I know this advice will work for both.\n\n**1.** Stop trying to fight your anxiety symptoms. Understand that the best thing you can do for your body right now is just let it run its course. This is the basis of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) which is one of the types of therapy currently used to treat anxiety disorders. To do this:\n\n* Don’t try to stop any symptoms you are experiencing. This is infinitely easier said than done at first, but with practice you’ll be able to pick this up fairly quickly. When I was first having constant adrenaline rushes, I kept trying to consciously stop them. This was actually making things worse. The more you try to fight your symptoms, the more worried you become, which in turn causes your system to release more of the stress-causing hormones, causing your symptoms to become worse. The best thing you can do at this point is wait it out and let your body tire itself out. \n\n* Questions, doubts, and fear will come up. When they do, remind yourself that this is a totally normal process that your body is going through, and try to rest in the anxiety. It may be difficult, but try to ease into the symptoms. This was initially what helped my adrenaline rushes decrease in severity and frequency.\n\n* If this isn’t working and you find your symptoms are still persisting and won’t stop, ask for more. As the DARE Response (discussed later) puts it, run towards your symptoms. If you’ve ever read a book on ACT, this step is likely in there. When you ask your body to make your symptoms worse, you’ll find it can’t. The symptoms of anxiety are driven by a subconscious worry, and not something you can control. Keep running towards it until your symptoms gradually begin to ease, then move on to step 2. In case you’re interested, the clinical term for this is “arousal reappraisal.” It’s not discussed very often, but I found it to be very helpful. \n\n**2.** Do anything you possibly can to get your mind off of the anxiety. In older forms of anxiety treatment, this kind of thing was referred to as a distraction tactic, but in The DARE Response, Barry McDonagh calls it being “engaged.” This basically means do whatever you can to focus your mind on something other than your anxiety. Regardless of what level of anxiety you’re at, this is incredibly important. **Your anxiety is most easily fueled when you focus on it, so do whatever you can to move your attention to something else.** Again, MUCH easier said than done, and your mind will fight you at every stage. But it’s an integral part of recovery. When I first started out, I found short activities the most helpful, like picking up my guitar/cajon and playing a song or two, or doing homework. \n\n**3.** Give it time. Your system can’t sustain anxiety levels this high for an extended period of time unless you consciously fuel it. If you are properly easing into your symptoms and engaging yourself in other activities you’ll eventually calm down to the next phase of anxiety recovery.\n\n**4.** If recommended by your physician, a benzo might help. Benzos are basically nervous system relaxants, but they’re no magic pill. When I took my first dose of valium, I didn’t feel a thing. It took a few days of constant dosing to see any effect. Benzos are fine to use in the very beginning, but I will issue a warning about them: try to use them as sparingly as possible. Benzos are not meant to be used in the long term, and if the first thing you do when feeling anxious is reach for your benzo, you’ll have real difficulty recovering in the later stages. But since at this point, you’re in a constant state of panic, they’re a great way to ease you down to the next lowest stage of anxiety, so you can start focusing on the long term.\n\n**5.** Journal. I don’t recommend this as much beyond this stage, as I’ve found it doesn’t really help all that much. But in the beginning stages of my experience with GAD, I found journaling to be an indispensable asset to really figure out what I was going through. Just write out whatever you’re thinking or feeling. It’s a great what to get out of your head for at least a little bit.\n\n**6.** Get up and do something to release all your pent up adrenaline. Walk around the block, take a stretch break at work. You don’t need to be doing a full workout at this point, just something to help you use the jitters and adrenaline you’re getting for something productive.\n\n**7.** This one may seem rather minor, but it helped me a lot in the beginning: fix your posture. It’s much easier to feel short of breath when you’re in a position that doesn’t let you breath easily. If you’re lying down, lay on your back. If you’re sitting, sit up straight.\n\nOnce you’ve thoroughly calmed down from this point (this took me about three or four weeks), you can move on to the next step.\n\nConstant 6 - 8/10 with occasional panic attacks:\n\nIf you’re at this phase, you are probably still experiencing physical manifestations of your anxiety, like jitters, nausea, jelly legs, shortness of breath, and so on. But you’re not in constant freakout mode anymore. You can make logical decisions aimed more at long term recovery because rather than being focused on your anxiety 100% of the time, you pay attention to it 80 - 90% of the time. You may be leaving the house occasionally but your symptoms are still bad enough that they keep you at home most of the time. So here’s what to do at this stage:\n\n**1. Start reading or listening to books on what you’re going through**. The more you understand the subtleties of what’s going on in your brain and body, the better you’ll be able fix them. Read up on therapy techniques as they’ll be your quickest route to recovery. In the end, this ended up being the single most helpful thing for my recovery. When you’re knowledgeable of exactly what is at your disposal, you can try everything and see what works best for you. In fact, I found really helpful ideas in books that none of my therapists had even heard of. Like your anxiety, the list of books that will be the most helpful for you is very personalized, but here are my recommendations (all of these books are available on Audible, which is how I consumed them):\n\n* The DARE Response. Phenomenal book written by someone who’s been through the worst parts of anxiety and paved his own path to recovery. His techniques are a combination between ACT and a little CBT. I would especially recommend this book if you’re at the higher end of the anxiety scale.\n\n* Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy. This book is considered the gold standard of CBT. It’s aimed at treating depression, but (as the author notes) it works for anxiety as well. I listened to the whole thing, then picked out the chapters I thought applied to me. It’s long, so I don’t think you need to do the first part, but there’s a lot of valuable information in this book that a lot of other books skim over.\n\n* Rewire Your Anxious Brain. This one is 1/4 CBT, 1/4 lifestyle guidance, and half about the neuroscience behind anxiety. I like this one a lot because it gets into some of the mechanics of why we feel the way we do, and why therapy and lifestyle changes are so impactful.\n\n* The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck. This one has been mentioned on this subreddit several times before, and I really like it. It serves as a great reminder of why some things in life just aren’t worth giving a fuck about. Fair warning: Mark Manson describes OCD as “an incurable disease” in this book. He’s not a doctor or therapist and isn’t really knowledgeable on the subject, so I’d take that section with a grain of salt. But the message he drives home at the end is really good regardless.\nRemember, the point of these books isn’t to give you step by step instructions on how to get better. Rather they are there to give you ideas on how to best help yourself.\n\n**2.** Get into therapy. This is perhaps the second most important things you can do for yourself behind reading. Therapy is the first line of treatment for anxiety, and for good reason. Once you find a therapist who you work well with, you’ll notice you progress much more quickly. Some things to look out for when you screen your therapist:\n\n* Are they nice? Kind of an obvious one but worth going over. Do you feel like they take what you’re saying seriously? Are their answers usually thoughtful and caring?\n\n* Are they experienced? My first therapist was tremendously nice and caring, but he didn’t know much about anxiety treatment beyond the very basics, like square breathing. \n\n* Are they accessible? Or do you have to drive two hours to see them? Are they available for weekly sessions or can you only see them once a month?\nIt may take a while until you find a therapist who’s right for you, but this is a person you’ll be meeting with multiple times a month for several months/years. I would advise giving your therapist at least three or four sessions before you consider switching to a new one. \n\n**3.** Continue with all the acceptance techniques outlined in the previous section. These are things that I remind myself of even now. The more open you are towards your anxiety symptoms, the more quickly they’ll dissipate. In addition, if you can, start easing off your benzo a little bit. If you’re taking it three times a day, try to move down to two. If you’re down to two a day, try one.\n\n**4.** Start making some lifestyle changes that are proven to help with anxiety in the long term:\n\n* Cardiovascular exercise. It’s said that exercise is one of the most positive things to improve mood when you’re anxious, but I’d like to look at it from the opposite perspective. When you’re anxious, your body is filled with excess adrenaline that keeps building up. If you don’t dump it out somehow, the symptoms will inevitably get worse. So getting up from your desk or your bed is one of the most effective things you can do to help yourself in the long term. If you’re not super exercise savvy, my suggestion is to get out and walk, jogging occasionally. Walking is great for releasing excess energy, but you can boost the speed at which you let off adrenaline by running. You don’t need to do sprints whenever you run, but you’ll get the most out of your exercise if you really challenge yourself each time. More on this later.\n\n* Meditation. The reason so many people say this is so good for anxiety is because it helps you better come to terms with your symptoms. It also lets you really hone in on some of the less productive thought processes you’re having so you can learn to catch and correct them. Keep in mind, the purpose of meditation is not to clear your mind and think of nothing. In fact, it’s almost the opposite. While meditating, your job is to let your body and brain work as normal and merely try to act as a conscious observer of all your thoughts and feelings. A really popular visualization technique for this is thinking of your thoughts as clouds, and you’re just watching them pass by. There is plenty of information out there on how to meditate, and it includes helpful techniques like noting, so I won’t go into it that much here. Make sure that your approach to meditation is similar to your approach to exercise: slowly ease into it by doing it for short periods at first, then working up very gradually to longer periods after every couple sessions. I suggest trying out the meditation app Calm.\n\n* Diet. If you’re reading this, you’ve probably read the do’s and don’ts of your diet about a hundred times, but I’ll reiterate quickly here: no caffeine, no alcohol. Try your best to avoid excessive sweets and fried foods, and those are shown [1] to worsen your mood in the long term. One of the less known changes you can make to your diet is to include more natural sources of magnesium. It is speculated [2] that magnesium plays a part in anxiety regulation, though the research isn’t entirely there yet. Regardless, try to include dark leafy greens like spinach and whole grains like brown rice into your diet to hit this as a staple. You can also take a magnesium supplement (I’ll defer to the DARE Response for information about it), though again, research is shaky so this alone won’t bring change. \n\n* Medication. This one will be completely at you/your doctor’s discretion. Some people respond well to antidepressants, some don’t. I didn’t feel like they helped me all that much, but you might. Note, the purpose of antidepressants isn’t to make you happy or to gradually cure your anxiety. Research shows [3] that antidepressants are useful for supplementing long term change in the brain. This is a REALLY important thing to note because it means that antidepressants won’t change anything on their own. Only if you give conscious effort will you be able to see positive change. Medication only makes it happen more quickly.\n\n**5.** Give it time. Your nervous system doesn’t change overnight. It may need a week or two more before you achieve the results you want. So just keep practicing your therapy techniques and doing everything you know works and push through.\n\nOnce you’ve been at these things for a while, you’ll notice your anxiety start to decrease to the next phase.\n\nHovering around 4 - 6:\n\nIf you’re at this stage, congratulations! The first two stages are really hard to break out of, and if you did, it likely took a tremendous amount of effort. So give yourself a pat on the back. Once you’ve reached this stage, your anxiety likely doesn’t manifest itself physically as much. You may still get nauseated occasionally, but most of the time you’re able to eat and drink and (hopefully) sleep through the night. You’ve started reclaiming your normal life. You get out of the house relatively frequently and do things like run errands. But you’re still really anxious whenever you go out. In addition, though your physical symptoms may have eased up, your mental symptoms may still be incredibly difficult to deal with. So here’s what you should do at this stage:\n\n**1.** Keep staying the course. It’s easy to flounder or stop, and it’s okay if you do. But remember to pick up right where you left off. Also, don’t beat yourself up for making mistakes. Everyone falters from time to time, it’s part of what makes us human. And it’s okay if things are taking longer than you expected. Take it from me that if you keep looking for ways you can improve your anxiety and practicing the techniques you know work, things will get better.\n\n**2.** Keep pushing the envelope. Identify areas of your life that you’ve always been anxious about and challenge yourself to use therapy techniques to improve them. I used to beat myself up for being awkward ever since I was a little kid. I’d find flaws in every interaction I had with others and nitpick every little thing. Once I started working on this, I noticed not only an improvement in these kinds of situations, but also an improvement in my overall anxiety. This is part of how Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) therapy works. You expose yourself to situations that make your anxiety flare up, and use CBT techniques to curb your conscious worry. An important note about this is **these experiences aren’t meant to be fun**. If you’ve got social anxiety and you’re challenging yourself by going to meet new people, it’ll likely be an uncomfortable experience the first few times. People around you may be having plenty of fun while you keep worrying and criticizing yourself. But you’ll slowly notice improvement, and with time, it’ll become more and more natural over time.\n\n**3.** Along the same lines, start making your workouts more difficult. Run/bike/swim for longer, lift heavier weights. When you’re anxious, you tend to stagnate in certain areas of your life, sometimes without realizing it. The only way to get better is to keep pushing the bounds of what you do. I saw a post on this subreddit a while ago along the lines of “I’ve been lightly jogging for 25 minutes a day for the last month or two, why aren’t I seeing my anxiety improve?” And the answer in this case is because this person wasn’t pushing him/herself. If you continue to do the same things, you shouldn’t expect to see improvement.\n\n**4.** Start identifying and cutting off some of your crutches/unhealthy habits. For a lot of us (me included), this comes in the form of googling symptoms or constantly asking for help on this subreddit. It’s okay to cave every once in a while at this stage, but you need to consciously stop yourself from constantly asking for help on the internet. One of the things this does is keep you focused on your anxiety, which is exactly what engaging yourself is meant to prevent. I stopped browsing this subreddit for almost a half year, and my condition got much better as a result. If you’re seriously concerned about something, visit your doctor/psychiatrist/therapist and ask them, but once they diagnose you, do not second guess it. I spent my entire college career going to different doctors (I think at least 10 or 11 different types, sometimes multiple doctors of each kind). I was convinced there was something wrong with me that no one could find, but the true culprit was anxiety. If you **feel** like you’re constantly sick or dying, yet doctors can’t find anything wrong, this is a clue that you have an issue with being a hypochondriac. You can go about fixing this the way you did in all areas of your therapy (I personally used the CBT method outlined in Feeling Good), but the important thing is to recognize that just because your brain is telling you something doesn’t mean it’s true. \n\n**5.** Give it time. I’ve said it before but it’s important to reiterate. Recovering from this stage might take several months, so try your best to be patient. And remember, if things aren’t the way you want them to be now, they will be soon.\n\nI think it’s also important to discuss the idea of **cognitive fusion**, which you may have come across in your book reading, as I think understanding it will be really helpful. Google defines cognitive fusion as attaching a thought to an experience, but since that’s kind of vague, I’ll give my own definition. Cognitive fusion is when you take what your thoughts tell you as fact. In other words, you’re using your thoughts to draw irrational conclusions about the world around you. One example of this is if you’re someone who criticizes themselves too much. You might tell yourself “that conversation was so awkward, so that person must think I’m a loser.” In this case, whether or not the situation was awkward, you don’t know what the other person is thinking. I used to think this a lot until I realized people really didn’t see me that way, and all the worrying I did was for nothing. A healthy level of questioning can do lots to help you overcome your anxiety.\n\nAt this stage, I had the most trouble with mental symptoms, namely the feeling of going crazy. I thought the little floaters in my eyes were hallucinations, I always second guessed my own sanity, I thought the weird dreams or intrusive thoughts I was having were a sign of schizophrenia, and anytime I was happy, I thought it was a sign of bipolar disorder. This is another great example of cognitive fusion that took me a while to get over: I thought I was going crazy, so to me that was evidence that I really was. If you think this describes you, it might do you well to get into the habit of questioning your thoughts as well. Is it more logical that your psychiatrist, therapists, family, and friends are correct when they say you’re not crazy and are just experiencing symptoms of anxiety, or that you’re the one person out of the fifty who’s somehow figured out you’re losing it? This applies to basically every anxious situation you may encounter. Remember: **just because you think something doesn’t make it true**.\n\nOne of the things that took me a long time to realize was that my constant worry over these things was caused by the fact that I was paying so much attention to them. At this point in recovery, it’s absolutely **imperative that you keep yourself occupied, especially when you’re most anxious**. I found that doing things like cooking and cleaning were ways to keep my mind off my anxiety without having to think about it. I suggest doing the same, as they’re both productive and beneficial in the end. Eventually, your mind will calm down on its own and you’ll find your own solutions to these symptoms. I find that at this point the really important thing really is time. Once I felt like I was going crazy for the hundredth time, I realized that if every time before this one was a false alarm, this one (and all the ones after for that matter) are false alarms too. This stage took about 3 months to recover from, but once I did, I hit the next stage.\n\nAnxiety is 1 - 3 most days, with some days feeling almost completely anxiety free:\n\nYou’re in the home stretch. This is it. You’re likely already giving yourself credit for all the hard work you’ve done, but you should still take a moment to recognize just how far you’ve come. For me, having a day where I go out and try something new with friends while anxious is something I wouldn't have been able to do even BEFORE my anxiety disorder. Certainly not anything I’d ever dreamed of while in the thick of it. Seriously, if you’ve hit this point, the light should be at the end of the tunnel. And on the days where it’s a little harder to deal with, let me reassure you: you’re almost home free.\n\nNote: your symptoms will still be present at this point. Some of the intrusive thoughts might still come, sometimes you’ll have a bit of dissociation or an occasional almost-panic attack, but you know how to deal with these things. Your moments of panic don’t last more than a few seconds, and your symptoms don’t really illicit a response from you. At this stage:\n\n**1.** You know what works best for you. Keep doing it. You have your techniques and you’ve clearly demonstrated they work. All that’s left is to keep doing them and reap the rewards you know will come. On the worse days when your anxiety peaks at a 3 or 4, remind yourself where you were several months ago and how you’ll never experience anxiety that bad ever again. Then gently engage yourself in something and ride the wave of anxiety until it subsides. \n\n**2.** Slowly lose your crutches. If you discuss your anxiety with your friends, stop doing so as frequently and eventually stop altogether. If you’re still occasionally taking benzos, slowly taper off. The more of your independence you get back, the more confident you’ll feel.\n\n**3.** Keep exploring other areas of your life where you’ve had anxiety and use what you’ve learned to stop worrying. For me, this meant things like conquering my fear of heights by going snowboarding, and confronting my discomfort with physical and emotional intimacy by going out of my way to discuss these things. The more of these long-standing anxieties you’re able to ease, the better you’ll feel overall. Plus you get the added sense of achievement for doing things that past you would’ve never been able to do.\n\nThere really isn’t much left to say at this stage. I found myself being discouraged more frequently at this point just because I knew I was so close to the finish line but not quite there. In case you need any encouragement, remind yourself of how well you’ve done so far and that there’s more to come.\n\nThen finally…\n\nNo anxiety, with the worst days peaking at a 0.5 or 1:\n\nThat’s it. All the voices in your head telling you you’re not good enough have gone silent. All those symptoms you used to worry so much about don’t really happen anymore. You might still be a bit fatigued or foggy some days, but most of the time you’re energetic, present, and can confront new challenges with a sense of confidence you’ve never had. It’s been a few months since you’ve even given your anxiety a second thought. You know some of your symptoms might come back for a short spell every once in a while, but you’re not worried about them. You know exactly what to do when that happens, and that they’ll go away just as quickly as they came.\n\nI don’t have any advice for this point. You know what got you here and have built up the mental fortitude to know you’ll keep on doing it. \n\nCongratulations. You understand how amazing it is that you got to this point. Remember this feeling.\n_\n\nMy therapist once gave me a great rule of thumb I think sums things up really well: whatever your anxiety is telling you to do, do the opposite. If it’s telling you not to get out of bed, do it. If it’s telling you not to go to a social event, do that. If it’s telling you you’re going to suffer from some grave illness, remind yourself that’s not true. If it’s telling you to google your symptoms or ask for help, don’t. If it’s telling you you’re losing your mind, remind yourself you’re not. Give it enough time, and eventually things will get better. \n\n**Summary:**\n\n**Ease into your symptoms. Remember that it’s just anxiety and can’t do anything other than make you uncomfortable. You’ve been through this a hundred times before and survived every single time.**\n\n**Don’t fight it. When you fight your anxiety, it only gets worse. So let your anxiety do whatever it wants and just watch as a detached observer.**\n\n**Keep yourself occupied. The more time you spend thinking about your anxiety, googling your symptoms, posting on this subreddit, writing in your journal, or just stewing in general, the worse off you’ll be. Cook, clean, dance, exercise, paint, draw, do anything you can to forcibly rip your mind off your anxiety.**\n\n**Keep pushing the bounds of what you’re doing. Expose yourself to more anxiety. Exercise harder. Try things you’ve never tried before. Make your anxiety flare up as much as possible because you know it’ll only benefit you in the end.**\n\n**Regularly question your thoughts. Just because you think something doesn’t make it true. You’ll find a hundred times out of a hundred the thing you’ve been dreading isn’t half as horrible as your brain has made it out to be.**\n\n**Give it time. You’ll find once you experience the same anxiety for the same reason for the thousandth time in a row that it becomes a bit easier to stop believing what it tells you.**\n\nThank you for reading this. I really hope that, no matter where you’re at in life, you gained something from this. Please let me know what parts of this were the most helpful, or if there’s anything you want me to expand upon.

I overthink everything constantly and worry very easily and so I never thought id be able to actually handle a job. \n\nI even opened up a bank account today for myself. \n\nSure, I’m anxious about starting work and worried I’m gonna be bad at it..but that’s a problem for me later.

With new people I get slight anxiety but it’s not crippling in any way. \n\nHowever, for some reason e-correspondence really gets me. Especially talking to people who are very pushy and demanding for quick replies. I don’t always feel like answering at the moment so I’ll put it off, but then I get very anxious knowing the reply is waiting for me, and I ignore it, and it makes me more anxious thinking the person is getting angry at me, and it’s a very vicious cycle. \n\nThe only time I don’t feel this way is when I’m either very busy working (and then I use the messages as a welcome distraction) or when I take Adderall for ADHD, because then I feel very assertive and have no fear. \n\nI think the lock down has made things worse because now I don’t go to the gym (usual fear release) and there’s no social time to replenish my mind in preparation for online messages, since they take a lot of mental effort. \n\nI’m curious to see if anyone else experiences this, and hopefully I won’t avoid your replies 😆\n\n=========\n\nEdit: Lmao this post blew up, and now I have 40+ replies to read. The irony is astounding! But I am to hear everyone else’s experiences too. \n\nI was thinking more and part of it may be due to the fact that each online message represents another demand on our time and another decision we must make. At least that’s part of the issue. And diverts from our energy when already in an inert place.\n\nTake care of yourselves, everyone >< Gonna go take a relaxing bath after reading the replies here",

    "body": "Yes we can say \"oh stop blaming your parents\" but the truth is, the reason why most are struggling with anxiety is because you had guardians who didn't do a good job of making you confident about yourself. Yes you can say its \"genetics\" but even then, nurture can either make the condition better or worse. You are raised with these people your whole life, the people that surround you growing up effect you whether you like to admit it or not. Maybe your anxious all the time because your parents would throw temper tantrums every time you made mistakes and that manifested later on in to your adulthood, maybe your anxious because you had Authoritarian parents that didn't allow you to grow socially, maybe you are genetically prone to being more anxious and the people you were raised with only enhanced that feeling etc.\n\nAll I'm saying is, it's so underrated how much parents can affect there children growing up. It can make life alot more difficult than it should be if your not raised with the right people. \n\nTo adults who are going through anxiety, yes its tougher for us but take it one step at a time. Don't compare yourself to others because they didn't live your life. They didn't face the troubles that you did, every small step you take is progress. I have a toxic family who doesn't see any of my small achievements but to me it's big. The past affects your present but it's about how you deal with it that matters.

It is okay to be afraid. There is nothing wrong with you. You are human and you are feeling afraid and I am here with you.”\n\nDo not treat yourself with contempt and do not abandon yourself for being afraid. You deserve unconditional love.

I will not reject you just because you are afraid.”\n\nKeep your promise to yourself.\n\nTell yourself “I love you, sweetheart.”\n\nWhen you are ready, share a small bit of love with others. Smile to them. Say please and thank you. Wish them well. Be kind. Let them merge in traffic. Do it without expectation for something in return.\n\nPick up a piece of trash because you love the park. Say, “I love you park. Let me help you feel nice. It’s okay. I got this.” (Even if you just say it in your head).\n\nRadiate love and safety. Receive love and safety.\n\nI love you.\n\nPass it on.",

    "body": "I've been diagnosed with GAD and have had a few pretty bad panic attacks in my life. Last night I was driving from my old apartment to my first house I just bought with the last load of my house plants (I had about 35 in the car, it's a hobby of mine).\n\nFor some reason I'm still unsure of, I started having a panic attack. My heart rate went up, the pit of my stomach dropped, I felt woozy, broke out in cold sweat, and felt extremely anxious. Right before going onto the highway, I pulled to the side off the road with my hazards on to give myself time to come down off of this panic attack. I called my partner, who was at the house, and told him I was having a panic attack and he  worked with me to help me get grounded and calm. \n\nI ended the call after about 8 minutes and told him I would call him back when I felt good to drive again. The intensity of the attack was coming in waves at this point, but it was gradually lessening. Less than 2 minutes after the call ended, someone rammed full speed into the back of my car. My car was lurched forward with an awful crunch, plant dirt and debris flew every where, I was thrown forward but my seat belt caught me. I was OFF the road to the side with my hazards on, this guy had to have somehow swerved and not seen my car to have hit me. \n\nI had no immediate injuries, but I was terrified. I've never heard myself scream like that. The panic attack I had almost gotten under control was now replaced with absolute mayhem of fear and pure adrenaline. The guy came out of his car and approached mine, I was already on the phone with police. He kept trying to give me his license and saying he was going to give me his insurance info. I was sobbing and telling him to wait I'm on the phone with the police. He handed me his license, so I took a picture of it while trying to describe to the location to the 911 operator. He took his license and drove off without getting his insurance. He spoke not great English and I think he was terrified and didn't know what to do. \n\nThe police came with an ambulance. They took my vitals. I had no pain in my neck, back, stomach, or any where. I told the police what happened and showed them the pic of this guy's license. They were like \"WTF this guy gave you his license but not his insurance and drove off?\" That is a hit and run felony. I think the guy was trying to do the right thing but got scared and fled. The police caught him in about 30 mins. Turns out a car with a lot of front damage can't get very far.\n\nMy car was totaled, the back wheel was completely torn off and the back axel was twisted beyond repair. Many of my house plant's pots had shattered immediately. I had to leave half of them in the car as it got taken to an impound lot because there wasn't enough room in my friend's car who came and picked me up. I loved this car so much, it saved my fucking life. I was beside myself seeing it being towed away, broken beyond repair, with some of my beautiful house plants still in it. \n\nI am fully covered for by insurance so they will be paying me out for the value of my car. I will be able to go to the impound lot to get the remainder of my plants and belongings. \n\nWhat just strikes me as so fucking cruel was that I had a panic attack and chose to safely move off the road to not put myself or other drivers in danger, and I still got hit and my car was totaled. \n\nI'm so grateful to still be alive and not in tjr hospital. But I'm scared about what this means for me and my anxiety moving forward. Will I have PTSD from this? Will I be scared of driving/cars moving forward?",

I attended an event yesterday I’ve been extremely worried about for the past couple weeks and the second I got in the car to leave it’s like my sickness just disappeared completely and I felt on cloud 9.

Sometimes it doesn't work and I can't go. Not even to the grocery store for example.\n\nI've used meds (benzos) for it for a while which usually work, but whenever I try to seek help the nr1 concern is \" well you gotta get rid of those pills \". I don't care a flying fuck if I'm injecting heroine if I manage to go to work, leave the house, do normal stuff.\n\nNot even 1% of people can fathom the struggle some people have to just go buy groceries.\n\nI've tried to seek help with this but every single time **only** thing I hear is \" stop using meds \". I've used benzos 3 times in past 3 weeks. I'm improving, no one cares. I'm working on my diet and excercise, no one cares. All I hear is \" stop using meds, stop using meds \". From medical professionals, family and friends.\n\nTrue, meds might make it so that without them normal things become more difficult. But my goal for now is to travel to work. Any means necessary. Okay I stop meds then what ? No one gives me the step 2.\n\nI've been unemployed for 6 months and my nr1 goal is to get a job, manage to get there and do well.\n\nThanks for the rant. Peace.\n\nEdit/update:\n\nHad a dr's appointment today.  I told her several times that my only goal is to travel to work. I said very clearly that I still need help, but I didn't care if it was in a form of benzo's, other meds or therapy.\n\nAs a result she prescribed more benzo's. And psyllium seeds. Also according to her, stomach problems and panic disorder are completely unrelated and have nothing to do with eachother... sigh.",

I really hope you will get better and find help, because those changes between those two are sometimes very misleading, and can be a false promise.

She told me to take the rest of the day off and offered resources our company provides for mental health.\n\nI always thought showing vulnerability at work was a weakness, but her kindness showed me otherwise.

One by one, as they march, our comrades vanish from our sight, seized by the silent orders of omnipotent Death. Very brief is the time in which we can help them, in which their happiness or misery is decided. Be it ours to shed sunshine on their path, to lighten their sorrows by the balm of sympathy, to give them the pure joy of a never-tiring affection, to strengthen failing courage, to instil faith in hours of despair. Let us not weigh in grudging scales their merits and demerits, but let us think only of their need--of the sorrows, the difficulties, perhaps the blindnesses, that make the misery of their lives; let us remember that they are fellow-sufferers in the same darkness, actors in the same tragedy as ourselves. And so, when their day is over, when their good and their evil have become eternal by the immortality of the past, be it ours to feel that, where they suffered, where they failed, no deed of ours was the cause; but wherever a spark of the divine fire kindled in their hearts, we were ready with encouragement, with sympathy, with brave words in which high courage glowed.\"  \n- Bertrand Russell, A Free Man's Worship",

I dialed the fuck out of that number, fucking killed it!! EAT A DICK, ANXIETY.\n\nEdit: I make a phone call and get my first gold in the same day?! This literally made my whole month.

    "title": "Weird but Surprisingly Effective Ways to Reduce Anxiety",
    "body": "Hey everyone,\n\nI've been exploring unusual ways to deal with anxiety, and I thought I'd share a list of weird strategies that have worked for me. Like probably everyone else here I have tried a ton of different traditional methods to relieve anxiety such as breathing exercises, meditation, journaling, therapy, working out etc and while those are amazing methods that work for some, sometimes nothing seems to help in the moment. So I started experimenting and came up with some unconventional tricks (and some I’ve picked up from others) that work surprisingly well for me!\n\nI have separated methods into different categories so you can browse each category depending on what works for you!\n\n**Body Oriented:**\n\n* **Turn Your Room Cold** \\- Turn the heat down or open a window. A colder space can sometimes help your body calm down.\n* **Chug a Bottle of Water** \\- It’s refreshing and forces you to pause for a second. Bonus: dehydration can make anxiety worse, so this helps on two levels.\n* **Lay on Your Other Side (Away From Your Heart)** \\- If you’re lying on your left side and can feel your heartbeat too strongly, flip over. It can stop you from hyper-focusing on it.\n* **Dunk Your Face in Ice Water/Take a Cold Shower** \\- This one feels extreme but it really works. It triggers your \"dive reflex,\" which slows your heart rate and calms your nervous system.\n* **Hold Ice Cubes or Something Cold** \\- The cold sensation brings you back into your body and out of your head.\n* **Sit on the Floor** \\- Just plop down wherever you are. Sitting on the ground can make you feel more grounded.\n\n**Mind Tricking:**\n\n* **Spell Words Backward** \\- Pick a random word (like elephant for example) and spell it in reverse. Keep repeating with different words until you are distracting enough to break the cycle of anxious thoughts.\n* **Count Things Around You** \\- Look around the room and count how many blue objects you can see or how many things are round.\n* **Force Yourself to Smile** \\- Even fake smiling can trigger endorphin release and convince your brain you’re okay.\n* **Do Some Math** \\- Start at 100 and count backward by 7s. Or do a Times table.\n\n**Behavorial:**\n\n* **Flip Your Environment Around** \\- Rearrange your furniture, your desk, or even just your pillows. Cleaning up your space can shift your mindset too.\n* **Play The Floor Is Lava** \\- Lol like the game you played as a kid. Jumping around the room is a great distraction.\n* **Eat Some Crunchy or Sour Snacks** \\- The texture, taste and sound give your mind something else to focus on.\n* **Wrap Yourself With Blankets** \\- Weighted blankets are ideal, but even regular ones can work.\n* **Gratitude** \\- Think about everything you are grateful for. This can help take your mind off of insecurities you are thinking about.\n\n**Environmental:**\n\n* **Turn on White Noise or Static** \\- The background hum of white noise can calm your brain if silence feels too loud. However, this one sometimes leads to hyperfocusing on intrusive thoughts, dissociation or depersonalization for me, so proceed with caution.\n* **Dim the Lights or Change the Color** \\- Swap your lighting for something softer or cooler (like blue or green tones).\n* **Smell Something Really Strong** \\- Smell something like peppermint, citrus, or even vinegar because a strong scent can \"shock\" your senses and pull you out of your anxious headspace.\n\n**Interactive:**\n\n* **Carry Something Heavy** \\- Holding something with weight can help ground you.\n* **Balance on One Leg** \\- It sounds weird, but focusing on balancing can help distract you.\n* **Scribble** \\- Grab a pen and just scribble as hard and fast as you can. Helps release energy, is super calming, and can help distract you\n* **Stare at Something Moving** \\- Watch a fan, a candle flame, bobblehead, the snow falling outside, etc. It gives your mind something repetitive and calming to focus on. However, this one also sometimes leads to hyperfocusing on intrusive thoughts, dissociation or depersonalization for me, so again, proceed with caution.\n\nSome of these sound ridiculous, but they’ve actually helped me, and I hope they can help you too!!!",

I was telling her how much I hate to pick up phone calls, hate doctors appointments, hate social gatherings, etc. She asked me why I hated them. And for me, it’s just plain uncomfortable. My mind goes to: who’s thinking this about me? why is this person calling me? Why do I have to do more bloodwork? If I don’t put myself in those situations, I don’t have to worry about all those things. \n\nShe says, that’s good! You’re beginning to see the root problem is discomfort. Comfort is something we naturally seek. It’s built in our DNA. BUT! Comfort all the time has a price. Just like too much of anything; coffee, sugar, working out, alcohol. You’ve trained your mind to view discomfort as an enemy. The feeling of discomfort isn’t necessarily a bad thing. In some cases it can be, but in some cases it’s the process of growth. It’s like growing pains. Sure you feel achey but your body is in the process of moving to something better. It’s completely fine to feel discomfort when you start to actually pick up the phone, actually go out and get an oil change, or putting yourself out there to your friends. But the more you do it, the more you’ll realize you can do. And the less it will be in the form of discomfort. Give yourself room to fail sometimes but by all means continue forward. \n\nIt took me a few weeks to think about and process this information until I decided to be brave enough to try. And I have to say, I’m glad I did. Just like she said, I began to see I COULD. And it’s been a game changer. Hope this helps someone else!",

    "body": "I’ve had absolutely crippling anxiety for the past 2 years. I would end up in the ER, sometimes 2, 3, even 4 times a week because of intense panic attacks. I would have seizure like activity and the doctors thought I was having seizures when I was coming in or I had a brain bleed. It was horrible.\n\nBut recently I’ve started working out. I walk for an hour at about 3.5 MPH (brisk pace) and lift weights for about 30/40 mins. Sometimes I’ll skip lifting certain days if I’m too sore or skip walking if my shins hurt too much and use that day to self care and R.I.C.E. to avoid injury. \n\nWhen I tell you I’m a different person, I really am. Just after about a week and a half so much has changed. I haven’t had a panic attack or anxiety for about a week. I became a hypochondriac and would worry about every little thing in my body. I have chronic pain so most bodily sensations are extremely exaggerated because my nerve sensitivity. Even when I have bowel movements they can be uncomfortable for painful when most people don’t notice them. I’ve really honestly ignored a lot of them. I can go through my day with my pain pretty much fine now. I’m starting to get some of my natural humor and confidence back. Not much has really changed on the surface, but my mind has healed to what feels like years worth of therapy. \n\nI’m planning on continuing this, and I would recommend you start if you haven’t been already. Once you start working out you will enjoy it, as long as you ease into it and don’t overwhelm yourself. You’ll start to enjoy it and make goals. And the future will no longer be littered with fears and anxieties, but hope and motivation towards your goals. \n\nBest of luck to all of you!\n\nEdit: WOAH! I had no idea this was going to explode! Thank you everyone for the awards and your kind words. I wish everyone luck. I’m sorry to anyone who said they’re unable to workout for any reason. I highly suggest trying to contact a specialist (doctor/private trainer/psychologist/therapist etc.) to help you work through any limitations you’re having. Everyone should have at least one thing they can escape to to help their anxiety. \n\nI do still get some anxiety working out but with time it’s subsiding. What helped the most was easing into it and making sure I was comfortable with my heart rate before trying to push myself. It’s not perfect but it’s just enough freedom to allow myself to improve my stamina and strength.",

Sitting here the next day, I can't believe I did that but I'm proud of myself. Just had to tell someone! Thanks guys.\n\nEdit: Just to add what was going through my mind at the time. My psychologist has really been getting me to expose myself to uncomfortable situations especially when you know they're going to be uncomfortable. I kind of figured she had a boyfriend/didn't date customers or whatever but I considered this an experiment in allowing myself to become uncomfortable, and just sitting with that feeling for a while. It's this kind of stuff that almost literally rewires your brain (albeit small amounts over time). If you keep avoiding things, your brain will get used to it and that's how you end up using avoidance to deal with being uncomfortable. If you expose yourself to those uncomfortable situations and allow them to run their course, those feelings start to become a lot less scary over time which can help build confidence. I'm no Psychologist so that was probably a C+ at best explanation but hopefully it makes some sense.\n\nEdit 2: Holy Moley the amount of encouragement and props is insane. You all are awesome.

    "body": "Before I start, I want to mention that I have not been diagnosed with anxiety so far, but this is the only community where I feel like I can let this out and ask this question. (Also im new to Reddit and don’t know how exactly this works, so if I do anything wrong please let me know) \n\nSo I’m currently 18 years old and as for my childhood I’d say it was okay. I was a pretty shy and ‘good’ kid so never got into trouble much. That’s also why I can’t recall ever being yelled at or hit. Maybe once, but my parent did apologise and state what they did wasn’t okay so I don’t think that would have affected me.\n\nHowever, I get so anxious when I hear anybody yell. It doesn’t even have to be directed at me. A few examples: one of my teachers has a pretty strong, loud voice. When he suddenly calls out a student’s name while I’m doing my homework, I pretty much flinch even though his tone isn’t even angry. \n\nOr a few weeks ago when a classmate wasn’t wearing a mask, a teacher followed them into our classroom and basically yelled at them for at least a minute. While this was going on, I forced myself to just look down at my notebook and focus on anything but the yelling. Though I tried to distract myself, my eyes were teary and I felt a lump in my throat and I was really tense for the rest of that class. I think that was the most anxious I had felt in years. \n\nMy sibling who is 12 can be described as a ‘troublemaker’ I guess. They’re the opposite of me which can be good at times, but it sometimes gets on my parents’ nerves. They don’t listen, aren’t okay with being told “no” and pretty much do what they want when they feel like it. Because of this I often hear my parents being upset at them and I’ve heard my parent yell at them a lot. Sometimes I’d be in the same room, other times I’d be in my room and they’d be downstairs. During these times I’ll also get very tense and just have a horrible feeling. If I’m in the same room I won’t even say a word and just get up and leave because it’s too much. \n\nI have no idea what to do with this. I have an intake at a therapist next week for some mental health related issues, should I bring this up too? And does this happen to anyone else? I really don’t understand why this happens to me \n\nThank you in advance for the help :)",

On my worst days I’ll have to take an Ativan to cope with the zero gravity rib cage crushing feeling - but if I’m lucky I hope to make friends with it so the floor doesn’t fall out from under me.",

Anytime I was feeling down or negative I would just hop in my car and go. The drive took about an hour and it was really peaceful, by the time I got home I was usually in a much better headspace. I just really loved that drive. \n\nWhen explaining the drive to a girl I was really into at the time, she was talking about how it’s impossible to remember that drive and every turn because there are many. I have driven on those roads enough to remember exactly when to take each turn, I proceeded to go over every turn. about halfway through is when i began to overthink everything. \n\n“does she actually give a shit about this?”\n\n“you look stupid just stop”\n\nthe usual. \n\nI then stopped halfway through everything, gave like a half smile and said that I had forgot. \n\nThis is just something that always goes through my head, there are probably better explanations on this but this is the first one that came to mind.

It is more than ok for someone with diabetes to be comforted even when their their blood sugar gets too low and it affects their work.

Interviews are a MAJOR trigger for me, I almost always have an anxiety attack in the middle of them, and I’m really not very good at them. On top of that, it was for a bilingual role and I knew I’d have to speak German and I was so insecure about my fluency and so freaking anxious that I would totally bomb and embarrass myself. \n\nI was SO close to canceling. I made a million excuses to my friends in family about why I didn’t really want the job anyway so I might as well not go. I am so, so glad I didn’t. \n\nI experienced a bit of anxiety, but no attacks! I wasn’t stammering and awkward like I usually am and I was really confident in all of my answers. Best of all, when they brought in the German dude so I could converse with him, he said it was really good and my pronunciation was great, and after he left they all said he’s Never been impressed by anyone’s German before!!!\n\nI never feel good or confident after leaving an interview, but this time I do. I Really Really Really hope I get the job (the office is UNREAL, benefits are wild, free breakfast and lunch, everyone was super laid back, better pay) but even if I don’t, I’m just so damn proud of myself for forcing myself to go instead of bailing like I always do.\n\nJust had to share because I feel super happy right now. :) wish me luck!\n\nedit: thank you thank you thank you everyone for the kind words. it’s so awesome to be able to share this excitement with so many people! :) I will update once I hear back about the job.",

It got to a point where I had to get my flu shot up my nose as a spray every year (ridiculous, I know. but the phobia was deeply ingrained into me)\n\nI knew I would finally have to face my phobia again with the COVID vaccine. Because I knew if I freaked out and just avoided it, it wouldn't be just me I was endangering. Since the start of the year, the vaccine is all I've been thinking about. I was *dreading* getting that text message to say it was my turn. And then I was having several panic attacks a day leading up to the appointment. It was pretty rough.\n\nWhen the nurse called me in and sat me down, it felt like I was going to pass out or puke or burst into tears... but then I just had this... surreal moment of clarity. I just focused on one of the wall tiles and just... almost tuned out of the situation. And then I felt it go in, and it hurt and I was terrified, but also strangely empowered? Like I couldn't believe I actually got to this exact moment without losing it and running out. \n\nI felt dizzy with relief and happiness when it was over, I think the nurse probably thought I was crazy haha.

I said sure, started prepping for the journey ( buses/trains are the most difficult part for me ). I ate all the right foods, slept enough, felt good. I took max dose of meds to \"guarantee\" success. \n\nEven with the meds and proper mindset, I was struggling at the second I left the house. Every step felt heavy, I wanted to turn back instantly. I made it to the first train then to the trainstation which had a bathroom. I had 45minutes to gather my thoughts before taking the next train to the destination.\n\nI got on the train and things just got worse and worse and worse. Every passing stop I just wanted to jump out, crawl into a ball and cry. 2nd to last stop it became unbearable. I jumped off the train and took the next bus home. Mission failed.\n\nI called my employer and was brutally honest about my situation. They seemed very understanding and offered to keep a 0hr contract indefinitely if I get my things together to a stage where I can reliably commute to work. So I made a good first impression and this guy seemed to appreciate honesty instead of me making up some bs lie about \" having some upper respetory symptoms \" or whatever which would've bought me some time. But I like honesty. I don't have to remember any lies and a lot of people appreciate it.\n\nEven tho they were very kind and understandable, I feel like absolute shit right now. For past 7months my **only** goal was get a job, go there, do well. Be normal. Today even with medication I couldn't do that.\n\nI haven't given up all hope yet and I'll start improving my diet even more and hopefully get to therapy asap. Apparently for people like me, sometimes the therapist meets half way if they know that leaving the house is difficult for the patient. Or even comes to your house. So that's great.\n\nThis was a major, major setback, but as my dad says \" You do everything you can, and that's all you can do \". I did everything. I prepared for everything. I had everything packed hours before leaving the house. I had a plan for when I get to work. But nope. Anxiety and panic disorder won this battle. Hopefully I'll win the war. \n\nAnd what gives a little extra twist to this: Traveling by car is fine. No problem whatsoever. But if I can't get to work, I can't afford a car. And if I can't take the bus, I can't get to work. Fml.",

    "body": "I (23f) am American. I don't know if it is just me, but I am horrified by the thought of working all day every day until I can finally afford to retire (if that ever happens). My current job isn't hard, but it sucks the life out of me. Every weekend is too short, and every work week is too long. I never feel like I am rested enough or that I have enough time to do the fun things I like to do. I don't feel like I have hobbies anymore, and I certainly don't have very many friends. I feel like I have to spend all of my \"free time\" keeping my apartment together or resting to try and prepare for the following week.\n\nI don't know how people do this for the majority of their lives, and I especially don't know how people manage to do this while also raising children. I think of all the things I want out of life, including children, traveling, homeownership, and everything else that comes with that, and I don't see how it is possible for those things to happen working full time. I don't even make enough money to do those things, much less have the vacation time. I'm working on budgeting and building my savings, but the math never seems to work out in a way that feels comfortable. I promised myself I would see Europe before I hit 25 and I don't think that's a realistic goal anymore.\n\nI get stuck in this spiral of \"am I just lazy\" and start to get worried that it is only me. Maybe, somehow, I am the only adult who cannot handle working full time and isn't happy about this being my life for the next 45 years. Sometimes I feel ungrateful. My life is fine - I have a roof over my head and food to eat. I am privileged in terms of the type I work I do. Sure, it is mind numbing and often anxiety-inducing, but it is a job that pays enough for me to stay alive. That's better than a lot of people can say. \n\nCan someone tell me it isn't just me? Or maybe give me a reality check that it is? I just don't know how I can keep this up for another 45 years. I'm so tired.\n\nEdit: I've taken some time to go through all the comments (though I didn't expect so many) and have really appreciated a lot of the advice i've been given! It's great to feel not as alone in this discomfort, and I think I have some ideas and goals on how to improve my situation in this new year. Thank you all so much.",

It was a pretty big story in my state and really big on YouTube if you spent any time on there in 2012.  \n\n[Mr. Anime](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.texasmonthly.com/articles/disturbing-new-details-emerge-about-man-arrested-in-familys-murder/amp/).       \n\nAnyways, I woke up today with a comment from a video on YouTube that I posted on. It was a web documentary that someone did on him, and I thought it was a nice way to get some of this off my chest. Of course, this really didn’t help, and I ended up super anxious. People taunting me about it and all sorts of troll behavior you get in YouTube comments.   \n\nA little backstory: I grew up with Trey from the age of 12 until he killed his family when I was 22. I had been in contact and hung out with him up until like 3 months before he did the act. He cut contact with me around then which I’m pretty sure he either didn’t want to subject me to that or something.   \n\nWhen I say we were best friends, I mean we were BEST friends. I spent the night at his house 3 times a week. We had all night WoW gaming sessions, his mom would cook us lunch and dinner so we didn’t even have to stop raiding. His family was so good to me, they were basically a second family. I was in his first ever YouTube video, and I continued making shorts and sketches with him, and even helped with a couple of his anime reviews when he specialized his channel. \n\nWhen he moved to his grandparents house in Hempstead, I visited often, and we made it kind of a party house. He filled his cabinets with liquor and he loved playing the host whenever I came back from college to visit. We definitely indulged in pot and prescription meds, but we were young and stupid. I didn’t do drugs outside of our weekend chill sessions, and I didn’t realize he had been addicted to those and alcohol.  \n\nThe thing about Trey is he always was pretty secretive. If I ever asked him much about his life or his relationship with his parents, he’d try to change the subject. Don’t get me wrong, I knew a lot about him, more than his other friends, but it took a lot of work by me to get him to open up. Many a night smoking weed and me opening up about my feelings before he finally did about his dissatisfaction with life, his lack of a higher education, and his fathers disappointment in him. I would always try to cheer him up and make him feel better and it seemed to work.   \n\nWhen the murders happened, I didn’t even know what to do. My girlfriend at the time comforted me, but I was just...numb. I literally didn’t feel anything. Then, my roommate at the time was like “oh let’s smoke a bowl that’ll cheer you up!” And that was when I had my first panic attack. I’m talking full on “I’m gonna die oh my god.” This went on for nearly 2 days. Constantly pacing and checking my heart rate. I couldn’t sleep or eat and felt like I was going insane. I actually packed up and drove to Dallas (I lived in Austin) to go to my moms because I didn’t know what to do, and she had a Xanax prescription and gave me one and I slept for nearly 20 hours.   \n\nI’ve struggled with anxiety for years now. I learned it’s caused by PTSD from the events. I have no health insurance so I can’t really go to therapy unless I foot the entire bill so it really sucks, this is my only way to talk about it honestly other than friends who don’t really understand. No one really understands. My dad thinks I should just get over it, shit happens, but he’s never had his fucking best friend kill his second family! A family that was honestly nicer than his real family, who treated him with love and respect and not judgement.  \n\nAnyways, sorry for the erratic writing or if it jumps around a lot. I’m kind of in a panicked mindset because I got triggered by all the memories of Trey. It’s hard for me to organize my thoughts when I get into this mindset. It feels like I can’t focus on any thought and my mind is just swimming and it leaves me confused. If anyone has any questions I’d love to answer, but I’d also love some advice and support. \n\nThanks for reading.   \n\nEdit; \n\nEveryone that responded thank you so so much. You have no idea how much this means to me. I’m in this weird place between joy and guilt that this got so many comments. Joy because I realized people care so much about a random person, and guilt because I feel I don’t deserve that compassion.  \nYes I know that’s stupid but that comes with the anxiety sadly. Like others have said, I feel I may have a bit of survivors guilt because I learned I was actually a target of his, and I read and article by someone yesterday where he did an interview with Texas rangers. Supposedly when he was 13 he was considering killing one of his friends. I know that friend was me. I remember that day because we were playing with guns as country kids will do and I remember him aiming in my general direction but kind of doing a “haha I got you” thing that he loved doing.   \n\nAnyways, I’m trying to respond to everyone, but I work 11am-11pm the next 2 days (yay service industry). So if I haven’t responded yet, I will definitely try. I’ll be going back to my inbox and on this post and trying to get to everyone. Thank you for taking the time to share and care seriously. ",

    "body": "My life is all mental agony. So many coincidences seem to happen, so many random thoughts put into my head while just as many or taken. I don’t feel real, at least a lot of the time. I feel like cutting off my fingers because it might show me something deeper. Like maybe it will bring me back or something like that, just not floating away. I just feel like the repetition in my life exceeds the normal, time doesn’t seem equal, I don’t have a cycle I live in, it’s like I’m rolling around in tube while others are strapped in. Time used to be the way I went through life to ground me, but it’s not even able to anymore, It doesn’t feel real, time doesn’t feel right. \n\nThat is why I’m starting to think that maybe this is all a simulation, or just a lie. Maybe I’m not even me, maybe I am in a coma and I’ve created this reality to stay sane, but I’ve been in it so long I’m not keeping it together. Or maybe I’m waking up and that’s why I’m out of touch. \n\nI laugh at nothing, just sitting in a chair and will randomly start laughing. I don’t know who I am, or what life is. I have a set of morals, but every so often I switch, it’s like I do a full 180. Everything is then different, it’s like I’m a new person, like a completely different person who would have different friends. It’s my secondary state luckily, because it’s the more violent and hateful of the 2 possibly 3 of me. I’m already full of hate and rage, but it’s just a supercharged on that secondary version of me. \n\nI don’t know what you think but am I okay? Should I do anything about this, or does it make sense that I might be imagining everything? I made this post to mainly explain how I feel and say stuff to have it possibly heard. Thank you. ",

    "body": "To start off, I have very supportive friends with whom I am very close. HOWEVER, some of the things they say out of support feel invalidating🙃 I have finally seen a psychologist (and have an appointment set up with a psychiatrist) recently. I’ve been in therapy for years and have felt frustrated with how slow my progress seems to be. That being said, I like my therapist and I had arguably the most life changing year ever last year (the onset of six life altering chronic illnesses does that for ya). I do think my mental health is way better than when I first started therapy, but it’s been so back and forth when I wish it could feel more linear. I’m trying to get into a good headspace before I continue pursuing college especially. That’s what lead me to seeing a psychologist and has me in my current situation. \n\nI strongly suspected I had ADHD for a couple of years after my sister was diagnosed. I finally got an examination, and last Wednesday I was diagnosed. This journey in itself was so frustrating because while most of those close to me validated my experiences,I had a handful of people who would say things like “well you don’t act like my other friend who has it” or just continuously ask me why I think I have it. They came from a place of trying to be reassuring? But instead it just sucked feeling like I had to explain myself and why I was seeking an examination. When my psychologist diagnosed me, she said “Well, I think it’s safe to say you have ADHD, but…” \n\nHence my current dilemma. Basically, during my screening, she said I exhibit very strong signs of having bipolar disorder. She urged me to seek additional screening, as on one specific test, I scored the absolute highest you possibly can for signs of bipolar. I was honestly very shocked but in hindsight, it does make sense. What’s frustrating is one of my closest friends (and roommate), who is diagnosed with bipolar, told me she doesn’t think I exhibit signs of it. It was another situation where she was trying to be helpful, but it just fucking sucks. In the days since that appointment, I’ve had one of the worst depressive episodes I’ve had in a long time. It kind of sent me through a loop that I’m trying very hard to pull myself out of. I’m now at a point where that appointment felt *validating* because it explains my lack of progress, the constant push and pull I feel inside my brain. Again, I don’t know for sure at this time, but just knowing a medical professional sees that makes me know I need to at least be checked. And I do have an appointment set up! This friend just also said “I mean, it’s up to you if you want to get screened.” And it just feels frustrating. I’m tired of my mental health journey being compared to others. Just because I don’t exhibit the same signs as your friend or yourself, doesn’t mean I can’t possibly have that experience. \n\nMy tendency to mask and be “high functioning” makes this experience so common for myself. I want to be able to share with my friends and seek support in them, but it seems to backfire as it just leaves me feeling invalidated. ",

It started off with some panic attacks, anxiety and depression, and I have started self harming as of about 2 months ago.\n\nI don’t know what’s going on with me tbh but I’ve noticed some patterns which I’m here to ask about.\n\nWhat stands out the most for me is the CONSTANT mood swings. My mood can go from happy and enthusiastic to sad/even depressed in a matter of hours, sometimes even shorter. I’ve noticed my mood can switch either at random, or from very small changes in my surroundings, thoughts, etc. these mood changes are really frustrating and I don’t know if this is normal or not. It doesn’t feel normal atleast. I can’t recall being like this 4 years ago even. I feel like shit because of this and I don’t trust myself anymore.\n\nNote that I’m not currently as depressed (idek if I even am depressed currently) as I was 2 years ago. My self harm stems from self hatred for the most part.\n\nAnother thing I’ve noticed that genuinely scares me (im just venting atp), is that my feelings towards people also change drastically as my mood changes. I can go from wanting to talk with the person, love the person etc. to almost feeling a weird type of “hatred” towards them. It’s hard to describe the exact feeling, but it’s like “I don’t want anything to do with you” pretty much. What scares me is the feelings are very real and I can barely force myself to go against my brain in these moments. This effects both my friends and family.\n\nCould this be something undiagnosed or is it normal? do I bring this up with my psychologist? Thoughts?\n\nThanks, confused guy in his 20s",

    "body": "\n\nThere’s a celebrity I’ve been obsessed with for a long time. At first, it was admiration, but over time, it became something more unhealthy. I constantly search for his name online, check comments about him, and get extremely anxious when I see negative opinions. It feels like my entire mood depends on how people talk about him.\n\nEven when I try to stop, I find myself going back, not even out of fear or excitement anymore, but just out of habit. I deleted apps from my phone, but I still find ways to search from my laptop. It’s like my brain is wired to keep doing it, even though I know it brings me nothing but stress.\n\nIt’s not just the searching—I also daydream about him a lot, sometimes for hours. I imagine scenarios, have full conversations in my head, and even respond out loud as if I were talking to him. It feels comforting in the moment, but afterward, I realize how much time I’ve wasted and how disconnected I feel from my real life.\n\nWhat makes it worse is that my life feels empty outside of this obsession. My classmates are moving forward—getting engaged, planning their careers, living their lives—while my biggest struggle is resisting the urge to check what strangers are saying about someone who doesn’t even know I exist. It’s exhausting, and I feel like I’ve lost touch with myself.\n\nI want to go back to the person I used to be, someone who only cared about their own life instead of being consumed by someone else’s. I miss feeling normal emotions. I miss being able to focus on my own goals. How do I break this cycle? Has anyone else gone through something similar?\n\n",

    "title": "Should I be worried about my attraction to fictional characters? It’s killing me inside and makes me miserable ever since I turned 18",
    "body": "So, when I hit about 13 and was watching YouTubers being exposed for being groomers, I suddenly had a thought of ‘what if I become like this when I’m an adult? What if I hurt a child? What if I become a pedophile/groomer/child molester? What if Hurt someone? What if my life gets ruined because of it?’ And it has haunted me ever since. This was around the time when I got into anime and fandom, and also around the time when I first heard the whole idea of ‘if you like it in fiction, you like it in real life’. \n\n\nMy age of attraction has always been higher than my own age growing up, even now I don’t really feel attracted to girls my own age because they look too smooth and too young for me most of the time. Sometimes there’d be a sweet spot while I’d be attracted to girls my own age for once, but then it’d go away and I’d no longer be interested. It makes being in highschool at the moment right now really diffucult, because there’s no one older than me so I can’t really have crushes, etc.. Other than the teachers, who are just my preference of 30s-60s, which is how old I like women. Makes it hard though because I’m only 18 and well, most 30 or even 20 year olds  don’t wanna date a freshly 18 year old woman. Hell, I even remember even having crushes on my grandmas friends growing up. \n\n\nNow here comes the issue, with cartoons or anime characters, this dosen’t apply at all. I’ve never grown out of the anime charcters I’d like when I was 13, for example, I am still very sexually attracted to nagatoro, whom looks like a young teenager, aswell as other ‘younger teenager’ characters like say, Capella from Re:zero or Rin Kagamie the vocaloid, The one orange haired girl from oreimo…this is where my distress has been coming from, and it’s making me extremely anxious. Honestly, any cartoons that look female get me off, including the gals from Scott piligrim, to like, the cars from cars and the teapot from beauty and the beast, but I’m seriously paranoid about the younger ones. \n\nI’ve developed a strong fear of children and honestly, anyone younger than me over the years because of this paranoia and a mix of other things (Bullied heavily in 6th-7th grade and elementary school, molested by a young teenager when I was 10, etc) while I know I’m not attracted to them, I’m still always paranoid I might be in the future or I’m repressing it and it makes me miserable. I hate going to school because of it, because I’m around people younger than me, and it makes me miserable and scared. And now the fact I still like these characters Is making me extremely paranoid and if this means I’m attracted to children or young teenagers. I don’t want to be a pedophile, or anything like that. I never want to hurt anyone. Ever. But I’m so paranoid that maybe, one day I will. It’s so miserable. I’ve talked to therapists before, never about the drawings, but about my paranoia and they think I’m fine and not a pedophile at all but, I’m still so anxious about it. I spend so much time researching it, and I feel like so many people would think I am a pedophile because of these fucking East Asian cartoon characters and by god, what if I am? What do I do? I honestly wish children didn’t exist sometimes, or that people under 18 didn’t exist, I hate being around even 16 year olds or someone in a grade below me. \n\n\nSo, Should I be worried about being attracted to younger anime/cartoon characters? Is this unhealthy? Am I going to become a pedophile because of it? Is this the first step to a slippery slope of harming an innocent child or teenager in the future? What do I do? I’m incredibly paranoid about it and it’s making me miserable. Any advice is appreciated. ",

I fell for him really quickly, he was so sweet, affectionate, charming, so we became exclusive after about 5 months. He told me he had aspd when we were dating, he told me he had like therapy and stuff when he was 20 and he can manage his mental health well. \n\nThe situation: once we become exclusive i noticed he started to change a little, he started becoming jealous if i was around other gay/bi men, including my friends, but i didn’t think anything of it. Some time goes by and we move in together. This is where things started really changing. \n\nSo I struggle with anxiety, depression and I was diagnosed with adhd around the time we moved in together, I was really struggling with working and juggling the responsibilities of the household because off my mental health. He suggested I quit my job and just stay at home because his salary would be enough, but I was unsure. He kept insisting over a few weeks, he said he hates seeing me struggle so much so I quit my job. We got a joint bank account too. \n\nHe started becoming really controlling of everything I do, where I go, who I’m with. We were arguing a lot at this point, he kept blaming my mental health as the reason and I believed him. I tried to get my adhd treated, I was put on meds and I felt better but we kept arguing so I didn’t think it was my fault. He then started hitting me, he says I make him angry, but he is really apologetic afterwards, but it just became more frequent. He’s says things that are odd which I know is because he isn’t in a good place. \n\nI have been begging him to please get help because this isn’t who he used to be, but he won’t admit that he needs help. I know it’s not all his fault, I have my part to play but how can I make him see that he needs help? \n\nI’m sorry if parts are badly written I’m writing this while I’m really emotional. I just want my boyfriend back to how we was. Can anyone give me any advice? ",

    "body": "Very disorganized rant, sorry...\n\nSo, ever since a couple of months ago, my sister has been experiencing paranoid delusions and auditory hallucinations probably due to her MS diagnosis. She claims to hear voices in the walls of her bedroom and accuses my parents of installing a speaker in the wall so her abusive on-and-off again boyfriend can mess with her. She doesn't believe us when we say that's not true and that we don't hear what she's hearing. She also says that there's something about the room that doesn't want her in it? I think that's just because she knows that the room used to be my grandpa's and he died in there but it's just a room at the end of that day... Tonight she kept ringing the doorbell (she's not allowed house keys since her bf took hers before and we had to change the locks) at 10pm but refused to come inside because she was afraid of the house. I guess her boyfriend dumped her. She also was paranoid about him breaking into the house and on one occasion she called the police because she thought she was hearing me being assaulted by him/whoever. This delusion kind of morphed into her thinking I was secretly involved with her boyfriend and started coming into my room at night to search it. It ended up getting a bit aggressive when one night while I was undressed (I told her this) and holding the door closed, she like battering rammed herself in while I was fucking naked! After that, I became pretty cautious and rightfully afraid of her so I got a lock put on my door. But this didn't stop her from pounding on my door some nights, insisting that she heard someone in my room with me. She refuses to believe anything I say and sees everything I do as suspicious. She says that she's been seeing a therapist but only once a month so I'm not really inclined to believe her either. She refuses to voluntarily go to a mental hospital, so am I really just going to have to wait until she hurts herself or me and my parents for something to be done about this situation? So, I guess I'm just asking for advice on what to do about all of this because I'm starting to feel kind of helpless! ",

    "body": "Hi I have been dealing with major depression and anxiety since I’m 10 years old I’ve been in and out of several crisis during my life, now at nearly 38 years old I feel like I’m finally losing the battle, I want to die, I don’t want to be here anymore, I want the pain to stop and after trying therapy for many years and psychiatric treatment and other efforts I’m finally convinced that this is it, there’s a lot of things that I need to take care before I can plan for it but that’s it, I’m tired to feel this way and I refuse to feel this way any longer. I wish that there were something to not feel this way but I have tried everything and nothing’s ever worked so…",

    "body": "i’ve dealt with anxiety my whole life and i’m just confused. i will occasionally have bouts of paranoia, always at night, and always that i’m being watched. the conditions are very specific: it’s usually something/someone in my room, they appear to be human but they aren’t, they’re contorted, they have red eyes and sharp teeth, and i will only be harmed(specifically eaten) if i see them. when this happens, i just leave my light off and try to sleep. rationally, i know that nobody is in my room, but i don’t want to risk anything, even if there’s a small chance. this has only happened a handful of times: 1) a woman died in my area after being trapped in an arby’s freezer —> i thought of the lady that died in the water tank at that one hotel —> i convinced myself that a man did these incidents and i was going to be eaten by him. \n2) i watched monument mythos (analogue horror youtube series) —> i thought that the washington monument was going to come to my house and eat me \n3) i read a conspiracy theory that john lennon and kanye were replaced by lookalikes —> i thought of clones —> i thought that their clones are in my room and they’re going to eat me. \n\n*** very important to note that i don’t have any hallucinations and i do know that none of this is possible/real, but for some reason i still get scared. also, im not asking for any kind of diagnosis!! i know that this is due to anxiety disorder, but i just want to have insight into what causes these specific fears.\n\ni really just want to know where this stems from. i’ve talked to two therapists and they can’t really give me an answer besides anxiety disorder and stress.",

    "body": "For some reason I always feel like I've been through too little to feel the things that I feel. I understand that it isn't comparable but most of the other people in my life don't and they compare me to others. They assume that comparing my life to others with objectively worse lives will make me view my life more positively in comparison. It doesn't.\nI don't remember a lot of the things I've been through probably as a defense mechanism. This caused my life recently to just be a murder mystery of what happened that was forced out of my memory. Maybe there was never anything at all. But I think something must have caused me to have adult levels of maturity and no will to live since a very early age.\nI guess people just assume that this is normal and a completely natural thing that happens to people at that age.\nI know that I've been through things incomprehensible to many people, yet it seems like many assume that they understand every feeling ever and make hideously wrong assumptions about how I feel and what I need.\nI have symptoms more severe than others that I view as struggling more than me.\nAt times when the symptoms are more severe I feel selfish and ungrateful but at times when the symptoms are less severe I feel like I've been through too much to live a normal life.\nWhen I do normal hobbies I feel like I'm wasting time because I have no chance of living a normal and happy life. With the state of the country and how it's going, I'd be lucky to live at all. Actually maybe it would be unlucky to be alive in a world like that. At least my symptoms would be valid at that point.\nI feel like the only way that I can live an enjoyable life is if I work and try as hard as I can but I already try as hard as I can and it isn't enough. Unfortunately everyone thinks I'm lazy because I don't do as much as others.\nPeople say that people should preserve their childhood for as long as possible but I've never had the chance to experience what a proper childhood is like. I don't remember being given adult responsibilities or pressured into maturing faster but something caused me to be this way.\n\nI wish I could find out what.",

I don’t have any desire to manipulate others or take advantage of them I believe it’s morally wrong and I can and have felt guilt over past things I have done when I hurt people. However the complicated thing for me is people explain that empathy is when you truly feel what others are going through. I have an easier time expressing sympathy or letting them know I hope things turn around for them soon.Or perhaps help others with thing when they need help like giving rides to coworkers and such. But I rarely FEEL what they are feeling. Am I overthinking it, not needing a diagnosis but just any input on what it could be. Once I have health insurance from my job I’ll be talking to a therapist.

    "body": "\n\nCant establish what's real or what's fake.\nSchizophrenia, psychosis, hysteria, or some kind of awakening? It's often said that crazy people aren't aware of the fact that they're crazy however I wonder if I am daily.\n\nI'm I losing my mind? Have I already lost it? Or was I doomed from the start? Is it my parents fault, genetics, or my own overexraggrated imagination?\n\nI am a 19 year old male. I should mention that I was diagnosed with ADHD at a young age and was prescribed medicine as a child but was eventually taken off as I approached middle school due to it getting, \" better\" as iv gotten older. \n\nMy family has no history of Schizophrenia or any mental illness apart from ADHD. So why do I feel the way I feel? Why do I dream the way I dream? Why do I think the way I think? Why does everything correlate with each other? \n\n Iv had these weird dreams that lead into each other. Dreams. If you could even call them that. More like nostalgic nightmares. I say nostalgic because it's feel like I belong there in a weird way, horrific yet comforting depending. Why? Why do I feel that way about it. \n\nSome of the dreams I would record and look at from a logical standpoint. As there is a lot of ways you can tell if your dreaming. Things such as not being able to tell time, reading/ lack of comprehension skills, lack of control ect. \nAll of which seem to add up. Yes. Just typical Dreams I believe. Shortly after turning 15 I started having these weird vibrations in the center of my head when I played down to go to sleep. Iv have had them before but not like this. Not all of the time but every so often.\n\nSkeptic? Ik. I don't blame you I am to. I still don't believe anything I feel regarding this is real. I don't believe that I'm special or that I experienced some sort of,\" awakening\". \n\nDuring these vibrational periods over a while I've Been able to get that feeling on command but only while laying down. When I give it to that vibration it spreads from my head to the rest of my body especially my finger tips. \n\nFrom there if I give into It ill end up asleep but in this world. The dreams I have don't feel like dreams. Call them lucid if you want but this still doesn't check out. \n\nNone of the former rules apply anymore. I can read, I can understand and communicate, I have control of myself but not the people around me. But there are two things that's always stood out to me.\n\nOne pain in this,\"place\" ,\"state of mind\",dream\" whatever is very real mental and physical. Two unlike typical dreams when you die in this place instead of waking up it take you somewhere else. The most considering part about that is it's always the same places. \n\nAnother thing I should mention is that in this place I have never seen anyone that I know personally like in dreams. My mom, dad, family friends nothing. Just strangers. Some kind, some not so much, some completely unhinged, and some not even human. Extremely horrific beings. As well as emotions I can't explain nor feel in the real world. \n\nAs a child I grew up with a religious grandfather, my mother and step father. My mother believed in demons, angles ect. My dads always been Skeptical. And my grandfather that goes without saying. \nWhen I was around 8 years old we lived in this house. location lexington Kentucky, Jackson Street ‐--‐--‐- A house with a lot of questionable history we didn't know of.\n\nIv never really believed in demons, or anything like that for the longest. Maybe my it was my childish imagination or maybe I saw something I wasn't supposed to. I would see shadows around the house, back door constantly slamming in the kitchen throughout the night, and distorted voices and stepping sounds coming from the kitchen not just a night but also throughout the day. \n\nI went to the school near there at the time William wells brown. A great school and as much as I love my parents going to school was the only good thing I would look forward to due to the amount of dread I would feel the moment I walk into that horid house. The worst part is no one would believe me until a month in and it started getting worse my dad went from Skeptic to full believe.\n\nMy mom and dad own a boxed wooden dresser well over 200lbs quite literally impossible for a draft to knock over. Until one night my mom and dad where laying in bed then they said it flipped over. My dad was the first out of the bedroom leaving my mom behind out of fear lol. \n\nFrom here on out things got even worse. At the time my cousins where staying with me. We feel asleep in my room on the floor. That same night woke up unable to move that was my first time experiencing sleep paralysis as you could imagine I was terrified. \n\nAfter what felt like 5 mins I could move but when I looked upon the wooden stand we had that held the whatnotts/ dolls we had that hung from the wall. There was one corrupted doll in particular that didnt look the same. What was once a piggy bank dog animal that my uncle had won for my mom via carnival game. Was now a dreadfull, black eyed, clearly in distressed baby doll with what looked to be wearing a bid and a dirty ripped bonnet. \n\nAt this moment even though I wasn't sleeping this was the first time I had felt that same vibration I felt when I got older. \n\nApart from my head and shoulders vibrating like crazy I was overwhelmed with adrenaline, dread, and disgust.\nWhile still maintaining eye contact with the entity I tried tapping my cousin next to me to wake up. \n\nWhen he did wake up, he couldn't really understand what I was trying to tell him until I told him again and again to look up. Eventually I gave up and bolted out of the room. He followed soon after with a scream. I'm not sure if he ran and screamed because I left him in a dark room by himself or because he saw what I saw but whenever I did ask him he swears he doesn't remember. \n \nThat same scream my cousin let out ended up waking both mine and his parents. I then started to explain what happened to and what it looked like. If I had to describe as a of today I would say it looked almost like the baby that fell from the celling from Trainspotting.\n\n\nSoon after that we moved out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe need up moving to a house right across the street from this one. Same street name, cover store, school and all. But this time the issue wasn't the house.\n\nAs i said before my grandfather is a religious man. And so he always took me to church with him on Sundays. I loved Sunday school. Even though i was a bad kid and usually ended up in trouble. But this particular day we ended up get someone new. A girl who appeared to be around my age. But something was off about her something I didn't like. \n\nIn Sunday school we had a small room all of the kids would go into it had coloring books, TV, a table and chairs that went all around it. At this table we all sat at and around lunch time is when they introduced her. We she came in she was wearing black shoes, white old fashioned leggs that led into a white dress. She had brown hair and her skin was extremely pale and abnormal, glossy like almost like a doll, like she was made out of plastic. \n\nFrom the moment they brought her in i Immediately wanted to do nothing more than leave. I experienced that same vibration again only this time another feeling came along with it. Canny? This was my first time ever experiencing a canny valley like ordeal. I was still a kid so I had no idea what I was feeling at the time. \n\nIt was just abundance of fear and I felt trapped in that small room with her. She didn't look human but for someone reason I must have been the only in the room that felt that way because no one look bothered. After a few minutes of being around her I feel sick to my stomach and immediately made and excuse to my Sunday school teacher that I needed to use the bathroom. \n\nThat was a lie. As soon as I left the room I booked it up there stairs into the main room where my grandfather was. He asked me why I wasn't in Sunday school and I told him why. He proceed to call me silly and laughed. He then gave me a hug grabbed my hand and walked me back down the stairs back to class. \n\nWhen my pops and me walked into the class he got a look at the girl and then turned around and gave me and strange unnerving look. A face I had never seen before. He then grabbed my hand once more and led me back up stairs with him. He turned back to look at me once again but this time he had a distraught look in his face almost as if a tear was about to fall from his eyes. \n\nWhich is saying a lot because iv only seen my pops cry twice in my life. He's a tough man that has been through a lot. \n\nHe kept me up there with him until the last 5 mins of the main service was left then walked me out to the parking lot and we left. He still goes to that same church till this day but he took a couple weeks break from that one after that day.\n\nWhen I got older I eventually asked him what happened. The first time he act like it never happened. The second time he told me somethings are just better left alone. That was the last vibrational feeling I had until after I turned 15.\n\nTo be honest I'm not really all that religious I believe in a god but I skeptical of a lot of things. For one the vibrations I feel. That may be some mental issues but idk. If so I would love to heard some thoughts.\n\nAnd for the record I have zero TBIs. All my mental and physical medical records are clean. What's wrong with me?",

    "body": "Hi,\n\nI'm 25M, and lately, I feel like I'm starting to hate everyone. I had a close friend from college who helped me get into his company, and I was grateful for that. But as time passed, I started getting better opportunities—higher salary, chances to work in other states, and overall career growth. I used to share my work experiences and achievements with him, thinking he’d be happy for me, but he would instantly cut my calls whenever I spoke about work.\n\nLater, through a mutual friend, I found out that he had been badmouthing me. Once, I told my friends about partying and dancing with girls at a pub, and he went and told them about how I got rejected in college and became afraid to talk to girls after that. Yes, it happened, but why bring it up just to embarrass me?\n\nHe also had a crush on a girl, but he would constantly criticize her dressing, how she posts pictures, and even trash-talked her and her ex to me. He said he’d never love her, but suddenly, he committed to her and hid it from me. When he finally told me, he acted like nothing had happened.\n\nTo make things worse, he’d mock me in front of others, saying I never dressed well before getting my job, and even told a senior that I wouldn’t be a software engineer without his help. I’ve decided to cut him off, but I can’t forget the past insults.\n\nI stopped talking to him for 2 years, But he's still in my instagram followers list and couldn't block him because he will reach out to me asking why or through mutual friends and it would really embarass me. what to do ?\n\nHow do I truly move on from this? How do I stop feeling this hatred?",

    "body": "On November 6th 2023 I tried to kill myself. I had been planning/writing my notes for about a week beforehand, when I finally decided that that night would be the night I did it. I stole my grandfather's gun, a half of a bottle of rum, and a bottle of pills as an extra measure. I drove maybe a half a mile down the road from my house at about 4am and parked next to a small gated field where I had gone to have multiple mental breakdowns beforehand and sat for a while, trying to build up the courage. I drank the rum (I had never drank before this point, only gotten high) and sat with it for a minute to try and ease my fight or flight, fortunately, it made me want to live again, at least long enough for me to call my sisters boyfriend and have him come pick me up, and take me home. Then I went to the psych ward, blah blah blah, not the point I'm trying to get at.\n\nI recently just haven't been able to stop thinking about that night and if I had actually gone through with it. I've even had times where I've doubted that I didn't didn't do it, and that everything happening now isn't just my brains final moments dying. But that kind of makes me sound crazy so I don't tell many people that. And it's not that I don't have anyone to talk to about it technically, I just don't have anyone I can tell that isn't too invested in me to be of any help. What I mean by that is that I have great friends and family that are there for me and want to help me, but the problem is that my friends either can't relate with me enough to understand and will freak out and tell my parents, or as for my parents, they care and want to take care of me and help me, but they will try to put me into some kind of lock down mode and have constant check-ins or suggest even going back to the psychward every time, non of which helps me, and I just need someone who understands and is here for me, not someone who will either over react, or down play it. \n\nTldr: I can't stop thinking about the time I tried to kill myself and I feel like if I tell the people in my support system they'll overreact",

    "body": "Not diagnosing- just trying to understand. I can’t talk to people IRL because they mock this. For about ten years this person has been obsessed with being a professional football player. They played for a junior college and spent a lot of time training and being great but not NFL material. We thought it would stop after college but he only became more dedicated and all this talk about scouting and how he’d been contacted for deals sounded like bragging or lying to ppl who knew him. It didn’t help that it was all he could talk about or bring up, so everyone got annoyed and thought he was just trying to lie. Im not saying this to be a jerk or ruin his dream but he’s over 30 now and somebody as football obsessed should know that it doesnt really happen at this point. The main point that’s freaking me out is he posted these things of like an “unknown number” missed call and he’s convinced it was a scouter and he needs to figure out who to get his chance back. To me this is the point where something is seriously wrong if something as simple as a missed spam call registers as a career in the NFL. He has been posting basically essays nonstop for days defending why this is legit and how upset he is and i cant twll if his mother thinks this is true or if she’s just trying to comfort him. Like i said this has been going on for years but it’s never escalated to this level of him being upset and it scares me that this all started from a simple spam call. To see him this confused and freaked out makes me think maybe he isn’t safe or conscious if that makes sense? ",

    "body": "I have put some thought to it.\nRecently I was at a mental hospital for about three months (wasn't my first stay) and I got diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. My therapist recommended that I should do interval therapy (staying at the mental hospital for 2-3 weeks every 1-2 months) to help me get more stable. I still go to school and I don't like the concept of interval therapy. Everything would be very stressful and chaotic. I'd always have to change between staying at home and being at the hospital. Normally I would've graduated this year but because of my mental health and long stay at the hospital I will have to repeat this year. If I do this interval therapy I won't be able to go to school normally at all and I probably won't be able to get proper grades. I'm aware that I probably won't be able to go on like this right now because I'm very unstable but i genuinely don't want to go to the hospital again. I love being home with my family and friends but I know that I do need therapy. Is there anything I could do? I still have some time to decide whether to go or not. My next planned stay should be at the end of April but I must say, I did not really have ANY profit the last time I was there. There were so many (to me at least) unnecessary therapies. I want to do therapies to help me regulate my feelings and anxiety, how to live with myself and my emotions and I really want to do trauma therapy. I do already have some knowledge and I don't think it's necessary to draw my emotions, to pet animals, to exercise or what skills are. I don't really know if I should go. I really don't want to but I really want to get better😭",

I start sweating as if someone raised the temperature in the room, the discomfort of my being in my own skin, the agitation continues to gnaw at me while my brain screams at me.\n\n\nI can’t breathe and It’s triggering. As the distress and feeling of a panicked emergency take’s place, I want to desperately run to someone, get on my knees and beg for help, I need help. By then and now I feel trapped and paralyzed, I feel imprisoned and my own body won't respond. I don’t want to feel this way again. I want to make it stop, I'm scared.\n\n\nForget being scared because by then everything is already out of control. Something is very wrong but I don’t know, I don’t know what it is but I need help because my mind is screaming and it’s triggering, I want it to stop, please.\n\n\nOh, by then I can’t stop sobbing, I can’t control my tears. By then it felt like I met my demise again and again. Something about being in distress while being screamed at just goes together. While being yelled at and confronted for not listening and cooperating, I try to control my breathing because by then I'm hyperventilating and having a panic attack. It felt like the world just collapsed on me, this is not what I wanted, in such a situation I didn’t think that I would be finding myself worried that the neighbor’s would hear me getting screamed at and that a poor indoor grill had to face the wrath of suddenly being broken due to this person all because I couldn't stop my panic attack and it pissed them off.\n\n\nI don’t want to feel this way, I don’t know how long I can continue to deal with this.

    "body": "My partner (NB, late 20s) is being discharged today after a serious mental health crisis that involved a manic SH episode and SI. Their psychiatrist has diagnosed them with PMDD with some bipolar and OCD traits.\n\nThey’re autistic and have ADHD. They were previously on Fluoxetine and Vyvanse, but it triggered mania, suicidality, and toxicity. Now they’re being discharged on Lamotrigine, an antipsychotic, Zoely (birth control for PMDD), calcium, Vitamin D, and a different stimulant.\n\n1. Confused about \"taking too much accountability\"\n\nLast night, they told me:\n\n-They feel scared to come home because of our \"dynamic.\"\n\n-Their psychologist and social worker told them they’re taking too much accountability for our conflicts because \"it takes two.\"\n\n-They feel like I’m always criticizing them and never seeing the good.\n\n-They feel like my expectations are too high and that they can't meet them.\n\n-They don’t know what this means for our future or whether we can even live together.\n\n-They feel like they don’t even know what I look like anymore (it’s been six days).\n\n-They said they’re tired of masking around me—but previously told me I was the one person they don’t have to mask around.\n\nThis really threw me. I never asked them to take 100% accountability - just to actually acknowledge and change the behaviors that hurt me. I don’t understand what their team is telling them because, from my perspective, the cycle is:\n\n1. I bring up a concern calmly.\n\n\n2. They react defensively, shut down, or deflect.\n\n\n3. I try to stay calm and explain my perspective.\n\n\n4. They continue to deflect or misrepresent my concerns, and eventually, I get frustrated and reactive.\n\n\n5. The original issue gets buried under their emotional response or my eventual frustration.\n\n\n6. Later, they apologize and say they want to change, but the cycle repeats.\n\nI know my own reactivity is part of this, but I don’t understand what “taking too much accountability” means in this context. I know my partner often omits key details when speaking to mental health professionals (their conditions got so bad because they were under representing how bad it was for them) and I am wondering whether I'm in the wrong or whether they're not explaining the situation objectively to their team for them to say this. I've never blamed the 'dynamic' solely on my partner but I'll readily ask them to take accountability for their side of the road. And I do the same whether or not they raise this with me. I'm just confused.\n\n2. My grandma died yesterday, and after begging for my partner's support, they still couldn't show up in a stable and supportive way despite being discharged and coming home today.\n\nWhen I spoke to them after she passed, they were cold, detached, and emotionally unavailable. Instead of holding space for me, they focused on their own fears about coming home, our relationship, and whether we should even be together.\n\nThis isn’t the first time. Every time I’ve dealt with a major loss or crisis, they’ve either been emotionally absent or actively made things worse. I don’t feel emotionally safe with them.\n\nMeanwhile, I have supported them through:\n\n-Their mental health crises (including helping get them hospitalized).\n\n-Visiting them almost daily in the hospital while juggling my grandma's impending death and visits, an intense work schedule and schedule for second job and and a sick pet.\n\n-Picking up all household and financial responsibilities alone.\n\n-Advocating for their care and researching resources.\n\n-Providing patience, space, and emotional labor during their dysregulated episodes.\n\nI don’t understand how I can do all of that, but it seems that they don't see it and think my requests for support are asking for too much? \n\n3. \"Your expectations are too high.\"\n\nThey told me they feel like I only ever criticize them and that my standards are impossible to meet.\n\nBut my expectations are literally just:\n\n-Follow through on what you say you’ll do.\n\n-Take responsibility for how your words/actions affect me.\n\n-Communicate instead of shutting down or getting defensive.\n\n-Be emotionally present and consider your feelings instead of immediately reacting to them as if they're true. They'll often hear criticism in my words that simply isn't there, or read into them the worst possible interpretation and I feel like I'm constantly saying 'i didn't say that though'. Recently, they've taken to saying 'intent doesn't matter' (because I told them that intent doesn't matter if they're running late and meant to text me but didn't for example) and so if they read into my words meaning that is literally not there that it's my fault because intent doesn't matter. I tell them, no, I said the words I said and that's all I mean.\n\nI don’t think that’s unreasonable. I don’t expect perfection, just effort.\n\n4. This used to just be PMDD, but now it’s not.\n\nIn the past, these patterns were confined to their luteal phase. But now, it’s happening outside of luteal. I don’t know if this is:\n\n-A medication reaction (they just started an antipsychotic and Lamotrigine and oral contraceptive)\n\n-A sign that there’s another condition at play (bipolar? CPTSD? something else?).\n\n-The mask slipping and this is just who they are.\n\nThey flip between loving me and acting like they barely care. Their opinion of me changes dramatically based on their emotions. I don’t know what’s real anymore.\n\nMy questions:\n\n1. What does it mean when a psych team says someone is taking too much accountability? What are they seeing that I’m not?\n\n\n2. Are my expectations actually too high? Should I just accept that this is all they can give?\n\n\n3. Why do they only seem to realize what they’ve done after the damage is done? Why does it take me getting upset for them to have self-awareness?\n\n\n4. Has anyone dealt with something similar? How do you tell the difference between mental illness symptoms vs. fundamental personality traits?\n\n\n5. Would breaking up be the only real option? I’m not in a place where I can financially move out right now, but I feel so exhausted and trapped.\n\nI feel like I’m going crazy here. Would love some outside perspectives.",

    "body": "TW: assault\n\nHi. I’m not sure exactly what to do but after researching and trying, this is my last stop. \n\nMy sister was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia in the past couple years. I’m quite distant from my family and me and my sister are even more distant. I never got along with my family so the caretaking of her has been taboo for me. The only link I have to her is that she constantly thinks everyone is telling her she graped me. I’ve attempted multiple times to tell her that didn’t happen but every time she’s off meds, she spirals and this is her only repeating thought. It’s starting to affect me since I did actually get assaulted twice (no connection to her) and my parents didn’t care at all but they constantly call me to reassure her that she didn’t do anything to me. \n\nIn recent years, we’ve attempted to mend our relationship with little to no hope. My family is quite avoidant and starting to give up on her and although we don’t have a good relationship, I’d rather learn how to help her with this and stay with her than for her to be completely abandoned. Help please . ",

Mostly people who talk to me about things that make me feel really insecure and then they vanish or false memories that pop up or sensations of being places I'm not. \n\nI have paranoid Ideation. It sucks. Like I know it's not real but I still think it is. I'm on medication but it only really affects my moods. I've been hallucinating for over 10 yrs. I didn't know at first. I just thought it was a glitch or something. Like an unexplained thing that everyone experiences. \n\nI just am constantly on edge. It's really holding me back. Sometimes I get deep into the false ideas and stuff. I will just stop taking care of myself or be disappointed that the stuff isn't real. I get periods of euphoria and I'm more likely to hallucinate during that. I start to think I'm over everything rough I feel. Then I just get so depressed when I realize it's not real. That I've been wasting my time. The worst of my paranoid thoughts manifests as hearing myself in others conversations and thinking bad things are gonna happen. I struggle to be open so I feel I have to pretend these things don't happen. I got diagnosed with BPD a year ago. \n\nMy psychiatrist dropped me because they didn't think I needed check ins so often. I have a thing where I always think I have to be doing well. Sometimes I don't feel that way but I cannot put it into words. I've had a few psychiatrists. Been misdiagnosed with a lot. I don't think I'm getting the care I should yet I can't talk about it. I'm doing rough internally. Nobody gets it. I can't explain it either. \n\n",

I know... that's a big and very loaded question. \n\nFrom the outside, my life would surely be described as worth living. I'm 34, mother of 3 wonderful kids, since last summer separated from my still-husband but we still get along very well. I have a job, a home, no financial struggles. My parents help with the kids and more and are very understanding.\n\nStill, I hate my life. Not the people in it. They are all great! I love my kids very much! Life is just so very exhausting. Of course, there are good moments, there always will be. Still, I just don't understand why people like living. I hate it. And I hate the thought, that I still have to exist 40 to 60 more years. I have weekly sessions with a great psychologist and meds that help. I have a severe depression and since december an autism diagnosis. That explains, why I never felt like I belonged. I really am trying to get my life sorted out. To adjust it to my needs, since I ignored them for 34 years. But that's a slow process. You can't change your neurotypical life in a few weeks into an autism friendly one. And I really don't know if I'll ever like living. If it ever will be less exhausting. I really don't want to live anymore. But I can't quit, so I won't. Because I have kids, and they don't deserve a dead mother. \n\nI don't know what I want to get out of this post. Nothing I guess. I just needed to get it out. Tomorrow I go to my job like every day, smile at the people around me like every day, cry in the evening like every day. ",

    "title": "7 years of isolation amde me hate humans",
    "body": "I wrote this in Arabic first, but here is the English translation:\n\nFrom the age of 18 to 25, the number of friends I spent my youth with and shared the most important moments of my life with is literally the most depressing number in existence: zero. Since I graduated high school, every attempt to experience any form of human connection has only resulted in failure, embarrassment, and shame. I wouldn’t even mind if my relationship with someone was full of drama and problems—I just want to feel like I still exist. These past seven years have not been easy. At first, I felt a bit of hope, but it quickly turned into panic, fear, and constant rejection from people. I ended up completely alone with my thoughts.\n\nWhen intrusive thoughts hit me, making me feel like something bad is about to happen—like a heaviness in my hands that makes me unable to lift them, weakness in my legs, or my heart beating too fast—I start thinking these are all symptoms of a heart attack. Literally, everything in me and everything I see around me becomes a reminder that I’m about to die, and there’s nothing or no one to take that fear away from me. And it’s not just about death. It’s also about losing my sight, my hearing, spinal injuries, and so much more. Every single thought that enters my mind forces itself into my reality, and with no one around, there’s no one to reassure me that I’m just imagining things.\n\n\nThese fears inevitably forced me to find a way to cope and reduce their intensity. And what was the only way I found to lessen these obsessive thoughts and fears for seven years—and still rely on today? The only thing that relieved me, even a little, was putting on my headphones, playing music, pacing back and forth in my room, and imagining people talking to me. I would physically react, talk to myself, laugh, feel sad, get angry, cry, and experience every emotion I’ve been deprived of. Most of the time, these imaginary conversations weren’t even related to my intrusive thoughts at all. Just imagining another person engaging with me—even about random topics—somehow made me feel a little comforted.\n\n\nI feel like I’m missing any presence of another being in my life. What hurts me even more is that one time, I was walking on the sidewalk, and two people were walking toward me, shoulder to shoulder. One of them needed to step back so we could all pass without bumping into each other. But to my surprise, neither of them moved aside, and my shoulder collided hard with one of theirs. The strange thing is, I didn’t get angry or upset at all. On the contrary, my first thought was that I hadn’t felt another human being in so long. Any touch, even a random bump or an accidental hit—I don’t mind. Just anything that reminds me that I still exist in this world. The feeling that no one knows me isn’t just about \"no one knows me.\" It feels like I’ve been exiled from existence itself.\nWhy haven’t I been able to form any real human connection to this day? Why have I been deprived of something that shouldn’t be this hard at all? Other people also want to connect with others, but they don’t want me. No one I’ve ever met has been as isolated and alone as I am. Everyone has at least one friend, even if their friend is annoying, stupid, or insufferable. But me—specifically me—no one wants. I am the outcast, the unwanted one, the one with a personality that even I hate, and everyone else hates, too.\n\n\nEvery time I tried to make an effort to form friendships, my weirdness and terrible social skills would show in the most embarrassing way possible. From kindergarten to the end of middle school, I spent most of my time alone, and my friends were extremely limited. I feel like this affected my basic social skills when trying to meet new people. I didn’t know how to introduce myself properly or pick up on the social cues people use. I was literally dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb. No one would ever be proud to walk next to someone like that. So, of course, I remained alone. But in high school, somehow, by pure coincidence, my social life suddenly flourished because of a few lucky events. I don’t even know how it happened. I felt popular, I enjoyed school, and my personality improved in a way that made me unable to imagine my life without my friends.\n\n\nBut then we graduated. And now, here I am—25 years old, feeling like my personality is stuck at 18 or 19. I haven’t achieved anything, I don’t know anyone, and I haven’t moved forward from my room. Every time I look into people’s eyes in the street, it feels like my shame takes the form of a giant being in the sky, crushing what little self-worth I have left. I feel my inferiority, my delay, my weakness. I feel envious of everyone. My future is over.\n\n\nI won’t say I want to kill myself or anything like that, because I’m not stupid. I know full well that if I did, the only reaction people would have would be mockery, ridicule, and laughter at me and everything I’ve felt—all the emotions that no one knows about. I don’t blame them. I mean, what else would you expect from a weirdo who lived seven years unnoticed? Did you really think there would be any other reaction? Huh, you idiot?\nThat’s why I would never harm myself through suicide. Because that would only prove everyone right—that my existence is as good as nonexistent. Honestly, even calling myself \"human\" is a compliment, because I’m less than that. No one has ever acknowledged my existence, as if I was meant to be erased from the world, as if I never felt any of the emotions they feel. But my will is strong. And I’m not saying I’ll become a criminal or physically attack people—no, never. That’s not who I am.\n\n\n\nBut I swear, all the pain and isolation I’ve felt will have an impact. The suffering that has destroyed my body and drained me—I will return it to the world. My pain has meaning. My emotions have value. No matter how much I want to reconnect with people, I can’t force myself to forget these past seven years. I just wanted someone to look at me like a normal person. Forget being a friend—just a normal human being. And then maybe, maybe we could become friends. But everyone sees me as weird.\n\n\n\nI swear, I hate all of you. I swear to God, I hope you all suffer and feel pain, and I won’t allow myself to feel any sympathy. Because sympathy is mutual, and if no one feels for me, I swear I won’t feel for them either. If I’m not human like you, then you’re not human to me either.\nThis time has been enough to prove to me that I have no value in this world. My life has been at a standstill, and it still is. My existence is as good as nothing. But I will make sure my feelings don’t just disappear like they never existed. With whatever remains of my life, I will make sure I prove my existence to everyone, and I will take my revenge.",

    "body": "I’m exhausted. Every day, I wake up and go to the hospital. I’ve seen doctors from almost every department, and yet, every single one tells me it’s just anxiety. I panic over the smallest things—like a tiny scratch—convinced it will turn into something serious. No matter how irrational it seems, I can’t stop myself from rushing to the hospital. Today, the staff even laughed at me because I’m there so often. I felt like a clown.\n\nMeanwhile, I see people my age enjoying life—riding bikes with their partners, hanging out with friends—while I waste my time and my parents’ money on hospital visits. My biggest fear right now? That my penis is permanently damaged due to extreme masturbation—10 to 20 times a day for the past 10 years. I’ve had erectile dysfunction since 2022, and I suspect I have Peyronie’s disease, even though multiple urologists ruled it out. They say my penis looks normal, but how can they be sure without proper tests like a Penile Doppler Test? I’ve also been experiencing extreme numbness and discoloration in one part of my penis, yet doctors keep saying it’s okay. Are they being dismissive just because they assume my anxiety is making me imagine things? Do they have some kind of preconceived notion or prejudice against me—that I’m just an anxious, paranoid person and not worth taking seriously?\n\nBut where did this anxiety even start? Is it genetic? My father was always an anxious person—stressing over things others wouldn’t. He used to hit me almost every day until the 9th or 10th grade. I couldn’t fight back. As I grew older, I became toxic too. I started taking out my anger on my mother. The cycle of abuse continued until one day, I cut off contact with my father. He stopped abusing me, but I couldn’t stop myself from physically harming my mother. It became a part of our daily lives, and I know that’s not normal.\n\nThe worst part? Outside my home, I’m a completely different person. I don’t bully anyone. I don’t get into fights. But the moment I step inside, I become someone else. I hate it.\n\nSometimes, I feel like ending my life. But I don’t want to die. I still believe I can turn things around. I just don’t know how. I want to be loved. I want to be a good person. I want to be happy.\n\nThe happiest time in my life? When I was dating my ex. That was the first time I truly fell in love. I’ve been in relationships before, but this was different. I felt so joyful, so alive. And strangely, that was the period when I masturbated the least. My lust disappeared. I respected her so much that I couldn’t even think of her sexually, especially in the beginning. It felt like divine love—love without lust. I was obsessed with her, ready to do anything for her. But in the end, she ruined me. She cheated on me too.\n\nSo, what is it? Can love heal me? Or is it something I have to fix on my own? Am I like this because I’ve spent years stuck inside my room with no social life? I didn’t go to a regular college. After high school, I just stayed at home. Could that be the reason my mental health is so bad? Would having more sexual experiences help?\n\nI don’t know what to do. I believe in God. I pray all the time, asking for relief, for happiness, for peace. But I’m still suffering. I just want to sit by the beach, watch the sunset, feel the breeze, and relax. But my mind won’t let me.\n\nEven as I write this, my anxiety is telling me something terrible is about to happen. That I’ll get diagnosed with some awful disease. That my worst fears will come true. And if that happens, what will I do? Cry? Give up? Live in misery forever?\n\nI don’t know. But I do know I need to change. I need to save myself. I just don’t know where to start.\n\nIf you’ve read this far, thank you. Please, any advice or suggestions would mean a lot.",

My anxiety is so bad that I feel like my heart is beating outside my chest, I want to crawl out of my skin, I’m floating above my body, I want to die. The only thing that’s keeping me alive is that I’m starting ketamine treatments on Monday and that’s my last hope for my mental illness. However that’s for treating depression and my ptsd not necessarily for my anxiety. So I told my therapist about all this and she said to make an appointment with the owner of my psychs practice and I did, for the 31st. I feel like I’m sneaking behind my psychs back but if she’s not willing to help me then idk what to do. I feel so suicidal rn. I just want something to sedate me so I don’t do something I regret. ",

    "body": "My friend \"A\" is the smartest, funniest, coolest person I know, but he has a very unhealthy obsession with running for president of the United States. \n\nWhile part of me thinks he could win, he has no qualifications, has never held office, never held a job, never attended college, and rarely leaves his house. He did make several million dollars in his 20s by gambling and investing, which he says he will spend on his campaign if he has to. \n\nHe says the only thing that motivates him to leave the house is the thought of running for president and making a difference. He is also slightly autistic, though he is definitely high functioning. He was diagnosed with Asperger's as a kid but has told me that is no longer a valid diagnosis. He says he'd like to be a light for other autistic people, which does make me think I could be underestimating him, but I don't know... \n\nMy heart wants to tell him to try but he's also said he doesn't want to make a fool of himself. \n\nThe problem is he's good. He knows every politician's name, he knows all this stuff about policy, and he's actually a kind, good man. He's articulate, he's charming, he knows just which words to say, and when he hits his groove I swear his fake speeches are as good as Barack Obama's real ones.\n\nHe used to have speech problems and was a very shy kid, so he's spent years perfecting his speaking abilities in front of a mirror. When we were teenagers he told me, \"If I can master my biggest weakness, talking to people, I can do anything.\" Well he went from being shy and socially awkward to one of the best speakers I've ever seen. I find him very inspiring, but I'm scared for him. Running for POTUS is no joke.\n\nHe will turn 35 before the next presidential election, and likes to tell me he would be the youngest person to ever run for president. He also has all these plans he's worked on that may or may not be good ideas. \n\nSo he is showing every indication he is serious about this. He's talked about it forever and always says he's been planning this for most of his life. \n\nBut \"A\" struggled with drug addiction for years and also has some mental health problems, although he can be good at hiding it. He is mostly sober now besides a little alcohol/weed, and I am proud of him for that, but running for president still seems crazy. \n\nHe has had these sort of manic episodes in the past when he's gotten really stressed, and I'm afraid of what might happen if he takes the plunge.\n\nI'd love for him to prove the world wrong, but how do I prepare to help him if he goes down in a ball of flames? \n\nHe has said that not trying will make him feel like a failure. He also admits it will be hard to win, and admits he does not expect to win, but still thinks he might. \n\nDo I help my good friend with his longshot bid to become the 48th president, or should I try to stop this train in case it becomes a trainwreck?\n\nAny advice would be appreciated...\n\nAlso sorry if this is the wrong place to post this, I wasn't sure.",

    "title": "Does it really get better?",
    "body": "I (F28) am having suicidal thoughts again. For context, I’ve always struggled with suicidal thoughts and thoughts about wanting to die since I was about 8. I grew up in an abusive household within a narcissist family unit. I still live with them unfortunately and have struggled since I was 15 to leave my home. For the longest time, my parents didn’t allow me to have a job, a bank account, nor did they teach me how to drive. I wasn’t every allow to go out or even so much as to go over to a friends house. I first attempted when I was around 16 and within one month I was hospitalized 3 different times. I basically spent Christmas in a mental health facility. My mom attempted to legally disabled me, never understood why. My family always complained about me not being able to do anything for myself because I was never taught to do anything by my family so it’s ironic to me that they tried to disable because wouldn’t that mean you’re the ones stuck taking care (or lack there of) of me? Anyway, I reached these basic milestones of getting a job and car through trail and error on my own. Even then, my biggest challenge has been moving out and cutting off my family. I live in Florida so rent is absurdly expensive and I definitely want to move out of the state and then I remember that I have to essentially buy my own freedom. I recently lost my job and have been nonstop applying trying to find even a shitty job just to have consistent income and not have to do ubereats all week. I’m in therapy and every morning I start off with practicing gratitude and positive affirmations. Lately, it’s been incredibly difficult and yesterday morning my suicidal thoughts came in hot. They have been in and out of my mind but with emotional regulation I was able to manage them, now… not so much. I cried all day yesterday and thought it was just a bad day and if I went to bed earlier, I could have a new day and feel differently. I was wrong. I keep trying to do my best to regulate myself and remind myself of a job interview coming up. My biggest question that has yet to be unanswered, does it actually get better? I tell myself and my therapist this can’t be it and there has to be more than just living in a meaningless marathon of misery. Of course, I know we all have bad day, weeks, months, years. Suffering in our life time is inevitable but I do wonder if this feeling of being unhappy and wanting to die will ever go away? If I can emotionally regulate my suicidal thoughts away and never feel like I want to hurt myself again or will I unfortunately be someone like one of my personal heroes, Robin Williams? Waking up one day in my 40s/50s, still unhappy and just end it all? I don’t really have a support system. I refer to my family as the “working class Roy’s” from Succession with all the narcissism and betrayal. The most I have told my few friend is that I lost my job and they haven’t really reached out to me and when I hang out with them, I don’t feel like they enjoy my company anymore. Other than my therapist and even then, her advice on “focus on what you can control” or “have you tried self-care?” Just feels insulting at this point. And let me clear it up, yes I am still doing my health coping mechanisms of reframing my thoughts, practicing gratitude and self care, daily exercise and socializing when I get the chance and above all else, believing it will help and this will pass. But the wanting to not be alive, even when I tell myself life IS worth living and trying to force myself to believe it when my material conditions don’t mirror that and I’ve been stuck in the same environment for almost 30 years, will that really pass or am I just gaslighting myself?",

    "body": "I was dismissed\n\nI was dismissed when I opened up about being sexually assaulted.\nCertainly, I was a jealous, lying 11-year old.\n\n\nI was dismissed when I tried to escape an abusive household.\nSurely, I couldn't make choices for myself and a teenager can only be the cause of problems.\n\n\nI was dismissed when I left home.\nOf course, I must not have realised what it meant.\n\n\nI was dismissed when I showed signs of depression.\nCertainly, it only meant that I was finally showing my true colours. It was simply who I was.\n\n\nI was dismissed by a therapist.\nHe fell asleep every time.\n\n\nI was dismissed by another therapist.\nYou see, a therapist cannot do anything for you but show you the door if you start to have suicidal thoughts.\n\n\nI was dismissed when I opened up about my struggles.\nSurely, a platitude with no later check-in is enough of being a friend.\n\n\nI was dismissed when I shared my feelings.\nObviously, I must have no idea what some people go through. People actually suffer, you know? \n\n\nI was dismissed when I shared my situation.\n'Why do you care?' 'Why do you stress?'\n\n\nI was dismissed through the obvious.\nYou see, some people end up telling you they really worried about you seeing you like *that*, but apparently they had to wait for you to get better to let you know.\n\n\nI was dismissed by another therapist.\nCertainly, I must not have been trying enough, do I even have discipline? Well, at least I was acknowledged for being 'indeed' fat.\n\n\nI was dismissed by a psychiatrist.\nThe appointment never happened.\n\n\nI was dismissed when reaching out for professional help.\nThe reality is that it took 8 months to find someone who wasn't even a good match, all the while dealing with suicidal thoughts.\n\n\nI was dismissed when I needed time to process being dismissed.\nYou see, I was creating a bad atmosphere.\n\n\nI was dismissed when I questioned things.\nWho do I think I am? What do I know?\n\n\nI was dismissed when I showed concern.\nYou see, I must have had too much time on my hands during my unemployment to imagine something was wrong. \n\n\nI was dismissed when I backed my concern with observations.\n'Are you on your period?'\n\nI was dismissed when I looked for connection.\n'You don't matter because I have broken up'\n\n\nI was dismissed when I offered help.\nSurely, nobody ever does need help.\n\n\nI was dismissed when I needed help to do something.\n'Just do it!'\n\n\nI have been dismissed as we all have been in some way. I was lucky to experience it very soon in relationships that should have been safe, when I still couldn't really grasp what it meant. It certainly prepared me better for what I was going to go through. But that doesn't make any of it OK, not with anyone.\n\n\nReaching out for professional help is brave, it is often what seems like a last resort. But those places are not always safe. I personally experienced only one matching safe place in therapy out of 5. This translates into a 20% chance to find a therapist that would actually be helpful. \nThis is ridiculously low. A therapist being unhelpful, if not straight up bad is *not* a neutral situation. From a place of despair, any interaction has deep impacts. And professionals come with an authority that is hard to fight, especially when our state is fragile, when trying feels hopeless, when our thoughts already need energy to be fought.\n\n\nI want to believe that I've been unlucky, it would mean that things are better for others, but it seems all too common a tendency for me to truly believe that. \n\n\nMental health issues are on the rise. Maybe you've been lucky, maybe you've looked down on those with such issues, but statistically, your kids, your nephews, are next. It is alarming. \n\nI am sharing those snippets of my history because while I was dismissed, you are not. You are not dismissed from playing your part in our collective responsibility to create a caring society. \n\n\nIt starts at our level. \n\n\nIt starts with how we interpret what we see. How do we label people who don't fit our expectations? How do we react when someone's acting differently than they used to? How do we act towards someone struggling? Do we ever push people to get a sense of satisfaction?\n\n\nIt starts in the space between each other.\nWhether with colleagues, relatives, friends, strangers, lovers.\nWhat do we bring to that space? How do we nurture it? Is it shared equally? What can enter it, what can't, and why?\n\n\nIt starts with ourselves. \nAre we accepting ourselves and our flaws? Are we putting our comfort first? Are we allowing connection? Vulnerability? What and who feels safe? What and who doesn't? Why? When are we defensive? When are we betraying ourselves? How is fear guiding us? What are we blocking? What are we fleeing? Are we observing our behaviours and others'? Are we aware of our impact on others and are we taking accountability and responsibility for it? Are we truly listening? Are we acting or hoping? Are we trying, are we questioning, are we learning, are we improving? Or are we dismissing, resigning, avoiding?\n\n\nHelping and receiving help are equally hard. Our efforts may not always matter, they may go unnoticed, get deflected and dismissed. But I think our collective power lies in trying, in refusing to give up, in keeping our light going and making it grow. With every smile, every eye contact, every small act of care, through every way we can show that we remember something about someone because we listened, that we recognise what someone did and contributed to, that we understand a situation someone is going through and how it does feel. It lies in every question that replaces judgment, it lies in acceptance replacing criticism. We're all flawed and we're never going to love everyone. But we don't have to make ourselves feel better at the expense of anyone, we don't have to bond through judgment, through the cultivation of feeling superior to anyone.\nWe can instead start to bond because we make space for each other, because we make each other feel seen, appreciated and accepted. \n\n\nI am not trying to advocate for a naive and impossible vision of interpersonal relationships. But it doesn't take that much to change a dynamic. It's inviting someone to join a group, it's calling out a bully, it's sitting with someone isolated, it's backing the voice of those who speak up, it's showing understanding for those who struggle. It's a thank you, a compliment, a 'are you okay?'.\n\n\nWhat if we started to truly care for each other and show up? \n\n\nAs James Baldwin said: everyone you're looking at is also you. But maybe you first need to see yourself fully.\n\n\nA ridiculous amount my 34 years, I have dealt with mental health issues. I have gone in and out of darkness more than once and reached depths many will luckily never know. Sometimes, life hangs on not much more than a feeling of guilt, a memory of kindness or new music to discover.\nWe are fragile and our battles are unseen a lot of the time. \nThe system is failing us and we are failing each other.\nIt is not to say professional help is not needed and helpful, it absolutely is. If my story is common though, it is easy to not feel that way and to give up. That's why we need to step up for each other.\nConsider donating to a mental health charity and hugging your loved ones a little tighter. Let's do better.",

I'm way more productive and social and forward, but I'm also way more reckless and I have noticed myself feeling violently angry when I haven't been that way since I was like 15. I'm even getting annoyed at my boyfriend for doing harmless things, which has never happened!! \n\nBut I haven't been to a doctor in like 8 years and do not have insurance and I am fucking terrified of the doctor's anyway. I feel like I'm gonna do everything wrong and answer every question wrong and my doctor is gonna be a terrible person who believes people with uteruses can't feel pain and should weigh 100lbs. I feel like they're only going to say I'm fat and all of my mental issues are all in my head and I'm clearly just too lazy to handle the real world. I feel like they're going to tell me i'm pregnant or have cancer or ask to look at my genitals. I feel like they're gonna tell me I need to get needles in my flesh for one reason or another. I feel like I'm gonna have a panic attack about absolutely nothing. I feel like they're gonna say there's nothing wrong with me. \n\nBesides, I'm poor as hell and couldn't handle a full time job anyway since we're too poor for a second car (bf works full time) and I'm too afraid to drive anyway. \n\nI struggle SO hard with understanding my own emotions beyond just \"bad\" and can't easily recognize patterns in my own body and mind because it all just feels like constant random painful chaos. How am I supposed to figure out if I'm having a manic episode, and wether all the energy to fix my life that I have now just disappears on me one day, and I get fat and lazy again???\n\nI'm so on edge and can't stop thinking and talking about politics, either, and NONE of my old hobbies hold my interest anymore. Everyone is an annoying asshole who needs to get the fuck out of my way right NOW. I feel like a crazy person with this barely controllable anger. \n\nI can't sleep or eat worth a damn!! I've slept an average of 5 hours over the last 2 weeks, never getting more than 6 1/2, and I can't eat well either. I get full to the point of nausea really quickly and so many food items are suddenly gag-inducingly repulsive even if I would not have minded before.\n\nOf course none of y'all can tell me what's wrong with me, but I don't feel like reading a list of symptoms on WebMD is gonna make me feel anything other than \"omg i have all those symptoms!!\" \n\nSo if anybody by some miracle has put up with me for this long; if you have any of these disorders, do these things happen to you?

    "body": "I’m not sure if I have some unknown mental disorder, or some sort of deficiency, or if I’m just like this. \n\nThis is a horrible word vomit so not all of it makes sense. In a rough place right now. \n\nI have no motivation anymore. I don’t really enjoy things. In highschool, whenever I was suffering chronic depression, I started a lot of medications, (SSRI, SNRI, stimulants,) and at the time they saved my life, but I am not sure if maybe they fried my brain or something \n\nIn highschool I used to be super driven to make art, I was super creative and had a lot of visions in my head. I’d fill up sketchbooks constantly, start difficult projects and just constantly creating with different mediums. I wrote a ton as well, and my brain was always churning with ideas and creativity, sometimes making it hard to sleep\n\nAfter highschool I just started losing motivation and sleeping all the time. I probably slept a whole year away. Lost an insane amount of weight from doing nothing. I can’t even really remember if I was on medication at this time or not. I think I was on anti depressants, and maybe ADHD stimulants as well. I felt happy but just preferred to sleep instead of be alive. \n\nI started working a full time job, and I didn’t really feel like the medication was doing anything for me anymore, so I just stopped taking it. I didn’t notice any withdrawals or anything either. \n\nNow, I work a full time job, go work out at the gym, go skate, hang out with friends, don’t eat unhealthily, etc. But I have no motivation to do anything on my own, ever. I don’t do laundry unless I have to clean an outfit to leave. I haven’t cleaned my room in months. I haven’t done all my laundry in years. My room literally looks like a hoarders room, it’s so bad. I don’t like to make myself food, or get gas, or get groceries. I constantly start projects and never even get halfway before abandoning them. \n\nThe worst part of it is I don’t create anything hardly anymore. I rarely draw. I rarely write. It is so boring and I don’t enjoy it, I have to force myself to do it, even though I just really want to make art. I can’t see things in my head anymore, like it’s empty inside. My attention span is so terrible that I go crazy trying to focus on the project at hand for more than a couple minutes. I just sit on TikTok during any and all of my free time because it’s the only thing I have the capacity for. \n\nIn the distant past I have suffered short manic episodes in which I would suddenly clean everything, start spending all my money and not be able to sleep at night for several days. Sometimes I go through bouts of paranoia where I start to think about death and get so genuinely freaked out I can’t think straight and do or say stupid things\n\nI tried weed to see if it would bring back any kind of creativity (probably a few months ago), and it hasn’t caused any problems that weren’t already there. I only indulge maybe once a week or every two weeks, to reset stress that builds up from work. Even then I don’t get fried. If I just stop taking it, nothing changes other than not getting to have a decompression hangout night. I don’t feel any smarter and my memory doesn’t get any better, and I don’t feel withdrawals or like I need it. Just a little sad I can’t turn my brain off for a couple hours. \n\nMy short term memory also stresses me out, it’s really bad, but it was like that before I even looked at weed, it started getting horrible right after highschool like I said. Same with my mental cognition, I am at least 1/3rd stupider now than I was in highschool, despite only having graduated 3 years ago  \n\nMy mental health was the absolute worst in highschool, I’d have random psychotic breaks and anxious meltdowns, sleep for ~18+ hours, and yet I was at my most creative and constantly making art. I was as sharp as a whip and very perceptive. I would get so excited over things it would make me sick, and would always be looking forward to starting new projects and finishing old ones. I just want to create things I love again and I can’t. I don’t know where it went and I don’t know how to get it back. I’ve been trying supplements and schedules and it feels like I’m just going to be like this forever. Like I’m going to keep watching myself get stupider and less creative and my motivation just completely gone in it’s entirety. Life feels really grey for me right now, like all the color has been drained from the picture. Days fly by and there isn’t anything that necessarily excites me in the ways it used to, like my brain doesn’t make those chemicals anymore. \n\nI don’t want to live like this. I don’t know if it’s adhd or if it’s some sort of schizoaffective or autism or what, I don’t know why I started mentally declining so roughly and so quickly after highschool. Am I just growing up? Is everything boring now? Did I have some sort of stroke or do i have some sort of early onset disorder? Did the medications fry my brain? Do I need to get back on all of them to function again? Was I even functioning on them in the first place? Do I have some sort of TikTok addiction which has ruined my motivation hormones? I just want to cry and sleep forever. I don’t know what’s wrong with me and I don’t know how to fix it anymore, and I’ve felt like that for over a year. \n\n",

    "body": "I have a psychiatrist but not a therapist at the moment. I’m only on Zoloft right now, dose definitely needs to be increased & maybe something else added. The Zoloft was prescribed to treat depressive episodes, paranoia, and irritability/aggression. My paranoia mostly consists of thinking people can read my mind, my partner (& sometimes other random people) is part of a conspiracy against me, & a strong distrust of people with minimal evidence. The paranoia really only hits when I’m in a depressive episode, its not necessarily my constant state of being. My primary reason for being medicated was because of angry outbursts directed at my partner for very minor non-issues (ex. fell asleep without telling me goodnight, etc) I have had visual & auditory hallucinations in the past but not at all frequently, the only full visual hallucination I had was years ago (& maybe you could consider shadowy figures/flashes halfway there) auditory hallucinations are pretty uncommon too. I used to have really bad issues with not being in control of my own thoughts (disturbing *gory or scary* images popping into my head without ability to remove it, other things that just irritated me) This is kind of just a rant, I’m undiagnosed and I feel like Zoloft just isn’t everything I need. I feel somewhat better on it I guess, but far from what I think I should feel like. If any further information is needed, ask away. I’m not asking for a diagnosis lol, I am just curious as to what my symptoms sound like to you (I won’t take it as the absolute truth or anything) &/or whether or not anyone else feels like I should be more medicated ?

    "body": "Thank you - seriously, even if it sounds sarcastic.\n\nFor the longest time I’ve kept up delusions of my “”life”” having any worth, or of there being any chance of me becoming an actual human being. Now that I was in residential for the longest time, and for past 2 months have been in yet another albeit less intense mental health program far away from “home” or my real home college, I realize fully that those things aren’t true. But the process of realizing that true thing didn’t begin with treatment.\n\nI know that you said that you said weren’t proud of how you handled the situation (as if I somehow deserved any sort of apologies or respect). But, and I mean this genuinely and appreciatively, it was inadvertently a huge factor in helping me understand that not only am I NOT an actual fucking HUMAN being like EVERY SINGLE OTHER PERSON “MY AGE” AND ESPECIALLY IN COLLEGE (even if I’m still not back there), but that at this point there is absolutely no chance of me becoming one at this point in my life “”””life””””, in terms of undoing past damage. So even if for whatever bizarre reason you thought that a thing like “me” was somehow entitled to an apology (I’m not) as opposed to anything other than expressions of disgust on yours or anyone’s part, the prior mess was still actually productive for me.\n\nI remember you telling me in your last message that you understood the way I felt, and had once been in a similar position yourself. I’m not sure if you meant just in terms of harming my”self”, or more broadly the experience of spending part of one’s life not growing up like a normal human being and than being lost when in the world, but I feel like you meant the latter. And that was one of the most important things. In conjunction with what you told me about your own history with harm, I saw that even if you at one time had lived a life where you were not human, you must have turned everything around WHILE THAT WINDOW WAS STILL OPEN, and still were a person by the time you STARTED COLLEGE at least. So, thank you for once again inadvertently helping me let go of another delusion about “me” changing. I now recognize that at this point in my “”life””, I’m too much of a mentally ill, sheltered freak to ever become a human as well, and that there’s no time, or point, anymore.\n\nSadly after some previous nights spent staring down bottles of pills I ultimately still seem to lack the courage to fucking kill myself like I need to (even though logically I understand that’s what I should do, I doubt I ever will, especially since I put all of that effort into my appearance, which working on makes me feel better than anything else in the world) but I’m really appreciative that this situation helped me realize just how fucking WEAK and EMPTY and HELPLESS I am. And more than ANYTHING how HOLLOW I am, completely devoid of normal HUMAN MEMORIES of having fun and also suffering and discovering one’s self and growing with other HUMANS.  \n\nWhat’s even more sad is that several days ago I was forced to be on a mood stabilizer. So as that kicks it will probably steal the depth and intensity of my emotions of which I am so proud, probably the only thing I can say that about. Already it’s more difficult to imagine myself being really moved by, say, a piece of music, or having these beautiful sobbing fits at night thinking about all that was stolen from me. And even if this med don’t make me feel outright horrendous like my previous concoction of 3 pills I was on until somewhat over a year prior, I predict that such “stability” will cause me to maybe believe these false delusional ideas about “changing”, or even worse make me okay with not being human.\n\nObviously I understand fully that this is wrong and inappropriate to send. In fact I understood that about the email I sent in early September, too. When I sent an apology the next night, I claimed that I was hanging on to a false hope about friendship, because that was easier to explain then the fact that I knew it was wrong but lacked sufficient mental stability and self control to not compulsively broadcast my suffering. That I’m doing that again just PROVES how FUCKING CRAZY and UNWORTHY of INTERACTING WITH HUMANS “I” am. And more than anything I’m just so tired of being me that I can’t even think of what’s wrong anymore. Plus my true feelings need to go out NOW before the meds kick in and I begin to believe aforementioned false things anyway.\n\nAgain: even if not intentionally, I’m really glad that I was able to experience something that helped me stop being delusional about “changing”. And, considering my outward freakishness and pattern of behavior, I’d hope that you’d be even one percent as disgusted by me as I am by myself, because I believe that’s the sensible attitude towards “me”.\n\nMy plan was to go back to school in August. As much of what remains of delusional part of me wants that to happen and still believes that things will turn around, I hope that by point that for one reason or another won’t occur; least of all so that I can’t be a THREAT to all the actual HUMANS that I meet!\n\nSigned,\nA HOLLOW, *exceedingly* effeminate, hopelessly awkward, sheltered, unintelligent, neurodivergent, FAT (21.8, up from 20.4 a year ago), hopeless excuse for a man, let alone a “”””person”””",

When I first started talking to them I didn’t tell them what was REALLY bothering me at first l, which were my violent thoughts. At first I told them about my other issues that weren’t as major but we’re still causing me distress. I’ve just recently told them about my violent thoughts and when I did they ended up calling a crisis center and wanted me to go there. I said I didn’t want to go and that I wasn’t gonna do anything but they were extremely insistent on me going. When I finally convinced them I wasn’t gonna do anything, I went home without seeing the crisis team.\n\nIm thinking about stopping going to that mental health clinic because that day was so horrible. I literally didn’t want say anything about these thoughts at first because I was scared of being seen as a monster and it felt like they seen me as a monster. I felt like crying while in that clinic because I felt so ill. Im most likely gonna stop getting treatment as a whole because im feeling extremely hopeless right now and that I’ll never be able to get the help I need. Also they have prescribed me anti depressants, I haven’t picked them up yet but say if I do stop going to that clinic and but the medication end up helping, would there be any way for me to get refills on the meds?",

    "body": "I’m 34, F.. I have been dealing with fear of developing schizophrenia, schizoaffective psychosis, delusion & hallucination since i was 27. \nI have been to different psychiatrist and I was on and off with Escitalopram 10mg. Right now it is my third time retaking escitalopram after long period being stopping medication. It’s my second day restarting it and I’m not happy and feel so much panic and anxiety. I know posting here on reddit may not be a good idea but I really want to vent out. \n\n\nMy major concern is the loud intrusive thought that sounds more like mind chatter and mental images/scenarios in my head whenever I tried to sleep and during a severe anxiety episode. I always get these whenever I close my eyes and it usually stops the moment I open my eyes. Usually it doesn’t bother me esp when I’m really tired but when I have heighten anxiety and panic episode. It caused me so much distressed and anxiety. \nThe voices that i have in my head are like internal chatters that says random words or phrases. Most of the time they sound familiar and it sometimes accompanied by vivid images. The way I would describe it is like watching a video playing in your head. It’s like dreaming while your still fully awake. Other times,  I hear song loop usually chorus. I’d also hear my name being called. Sometimes it was a faint scream or yell when I’m about to sleep/have shallow sleep and when I was awaken by panic attack. Sometimes the images are disturbing that I refused to sleep because it cause me so much distress cos I feel like I am schizophrenic and experiencing psychosis. I read article, tiktok video and post about people experiencing internal auditory hallucination and closed-eyed hallucination very similar to my own. And they it is a symptoms of schizophrenia now my mind is convince that I have it. I feel like sinking. \n\nThere are times when I am constantly thinking about my symptoms almost 24/7 that I trigger my anxiety and I started having disorganized word salad train of thoughts where my mind would send me gibberish thoughts/words that doesn’t make sense and it would caused me so much distress. And whether I happen to think or imagine positive/negative scenarios my mind would automatically think it’s delusion.. I keep constantly asking myself what if I start believing in my thoughts. What if i experience delusions? What if I start having psychosis. What if my meds don’t work anymore. When I read about symptoms of schizophrenia or psychosis being not able to process a thought or having different thought that doesn’t make sense it sent me into a downward spiral. I have become so fearful and scared of almost everything. I get scared when I get intrusive thoughts. I get scared when I stutter or paused when I speak. I get scared when I get mental block or forget things. I get scared when I had typo when I text. When I watch a video about prodromal psychosis or read about it, my mind think i have it. And not just that. I’d even feel the sensations and symptoms starts showing up. \n\nI have become hyperaware and sensitive with what i hear. Even the tiniest noise. With what i see that I need to double check. Lately even I become sensitive to smell that when I smell something bad even the slightest my mind would question whether I am the other one who can smell it. When I hear even the fainting noise, I’d try to look for the source. Sometimes I get scared looking or watching videos because I was scared I might start believing it. I have been avoiding messaging my friends because I’m scared I might send them crazy stuff. Sometimes I get scared being out in public bcos I kept thinking what if I start acting crazy. Heck I even got scared looking at posters and billboard even though it’s not scary. I feel like I am experiencing paranoia. I can’t sleep cos I can’t stop thinking about it. From the moment I wake up to the time I go to sleep. I honestly thinking rather die than to experience psychosis delusion or go insane. \n\nIt’s really hard living like this. I forgot who I used to be before my anxiety. ",

I grew up with a bipolar mother and knew how it would be, i had insight. I continued to go and to therapy (plus hospitalizations) and whatnot until i was 17 then stopped because it felt like a waste of time. I started back going when i was 19 and started talking to someone new and was diagnosed with PTSD which had been a discussion before ( i never stayed in one place long enough) but again I knew that BUT was okay with it. I once again fell into the pattern of stopping and going back until last year i gave it one more shot and was told during my last session that my new diagnosis would most likely be borderline personality disorder and honestly it scared me. I stopped going again. It felt wrong and it scared the living shit out of me because i never heard any good things about it and from hearing ppl talk, they called anyone with bpd crazy and i didn't want to be that. i heard it enough growing up and continue to hear it because still, i am struggling and i desperately want to get help because i feel like i'm constantly falling apart but still i'm scared to received that diagnosis. I want to feel better, even if it's a little. i just want to feel.. normal? again. I'm stuck in this weird cycle of wanting to be diagnosed so i can get better but at the same time i'm scared that i will be handed that card. i don't know much about bpd so i don't even know if it's possible to get better so what i'm asking is, how did you come to terms with it? is there good treatment options? is it even worth getting the diagnosis? or am i just screwed?",

    "body": "Hey folks, \n\nSo, im very open about the fact I struggle with treatment resistant depression, PTSD, BPD, and ADHD. I have tried every antidepressant (first generation, SSRIs, SNRIs, atypical/off-label), typical and atypical antipsychotics, and some mood stabilizers as well as cognitive behavioural therapy, dialectical behaviour therapy, cognitive processing therapy, EMDR, emotion focused therapy, existential/eclectic/psychodynamic therapy, internal family systems therapy, and somatic/hypnotic therapy. I have even tried third-line depression options like IV ketamine therapy and unilateral (one side/temple) ECT (electroconvulsive therapy). Right now im being recommended ECT again, however it would be bilateral (both sides/temples) this time, which tends to be a lot more effective but also have a lot more side effects. \n\n*side note: to those who aren’t aware, yes, ECT is still something performed today. It is nothing like it used to be back in the 60s or how it’s shown in the movies. You get put to sleep, given a paralytic so you don’t experience muscle contractions, and then a low electric current is passed through your brain to trigger a controlled, therapeutic seizure. You do not experience any pain other than possibly a headache and the entire procedure + anesthesia lasts maybe ten minutes. It is a very safe procedure*\n\nThe active phase of the procedure is getting ECT three times a week Monday, Wednesday, and Friday for a minimum of four weeks. Once the active phase is completed you move on to the weekly maintenance phase and slowly decrease the frequency of treatment. Anyway, the efficacy for this treatment is 60%-80%, which compared to other treatments for mental disorders is considered very high. I only noticed mild benefit with unilateral ECT (this is often the case, most people end up needing bilateral ECT but they try the unilateral first for those who only end up needing that one side for full benefit and that way reduce the possibility and intensity of side effects). I’d also like to reiterate just how much “this is my last option”. I have tried everything, I mean literally everything that can be tried for depression AND then some. \n\nHowever, the side effects of bilateral ECT can be pretty intense. I was lucky to only experience headaches when I did unilateral but I was promised I would not be so lucky with bilateral. The biggest, most common, most intense symptom is memory loss. It can be pretty severe, lots of people report having blackouts where they lose memory of several hours of the day and just randomly “gain consciousness” in the middle of nowhere or performing a random activity hours later. You experience significant cognitive decline (like they make you do typical Alzheimer’s diagnostic tests to monitor the rate of your decline). The bright side is that permanent memory loss and cognitive decline is uncommon, it usually only lasts during the active phase of your treatment and maybe early into your maintenance phase too. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice or even just their personal opinion on what they would do? \n\n",

    "body": "So I wanted to start this by saying I’ve been clean from c//tting as a self harm tool for years now, I don’t know the exact time frame and quite frankly I’m not bothered about that but the point is I haven’t c//t myself for years. I stopped because my parents found out and I couldn’t bare to see them see more fresh scars so I stopped out of fear and then I’ve not touched a blade in that way, minus the brief period of relapse shortly after without visible scars on my leg. \n\nI’m scared, because usually when I’ve had thoughts of c//tting myself they’ve been momentary, I know they’ll pass, just the urge gets strong. Except the urge isn’t strong right now in this period of time, it’s come up a few times right before panic attacks but the planning, the made up scenarios of what would happen if I do do it have happened. Like intrusive thoughts except… I lean into them. It’s like I’m mentally preparing myself to get worse and need this tool again. Because the truth is, my mental health is shit again, the shittiest it has been since school, I opened up something inside of me and suddenly all this repressed anxiety has just made its way to the top and I don’t know what to do except actually deal with it because I can’t suppress it again, I want to get better. I’m receiving therapy so I CAN get better. \n\nPeople at my work know about my anxiety right now, I’ve been trying to tell as many people as I can about my mental health so that they can support me so that it’s easier to look after myself. Even the store manager knows right now (she’s been super supportive and I really trust her). But fuck can they find out about these thoughts. There’s only one person I’d potentially trust with this information because she’s young but old enough that she’s more recovered from her anxiety, but I don’t want to worry her with this information and she is a supervisor despite the fact she’s very friendly with me and I worry that even mentioning something like this to her she’d have the duty to report it. I worry people will think I’m a danger to myself but right now I’m not, that’s the thing, I’m just growing increasingly worried that it’ll only be a matter of time until I will be. How much anxiety and pain and suffering do I have to endure again to feel like I need to relapse to cope? Because everything is getting more serious, what was just more panic attacks and more anxiety has mentally drained me over the past few weeks and made me more actively process the trauma I’ve been through because ultimately, that is the root reason as to why I’m doing this shit right now.\n\nI’m scared though. I keep saying these are just thoughts and it doesn’t mean I’ll do anything but I have a blade in my bag. It’s from my past job, a box cutter, I need to get rid of it but idk how and where. And this is so stupid of me but I just picked it up and looked at it and I pressed my finger on the blade part and then really pressed down just to see how easily it COULD cut, and yes it’s very blunt but I figured with enough force and pressure it could do harm. I don’t know why I did it, I didn’t draw blood on my finger cause it wasn’t the attempt of self harm it was just seeing how easy or hard it would be to use and now I feel like an idiot and more of a danger to myself than I was because why would I absent mindedly do something like that? If I do that with barely any thought then what’s stopping me from making the first mark again? Then what? \n\nMy partner doesn’t even know I’ve had these thoughts and considerations, they’ve heard when I’ve had urges but nothing this serious because they know about my anxiety and if they know I’ve had these thoughts it’ll break them. I’m seeing them tomorrow and staying over theirs for a few nights and I don’t know what to do because what if I have these thoughts there? I don’t know how to tell them that I might not be able to keep myself safe come a few more weeks when I might have had enough…",

But for the past couple of years it has made its own dark effects. Sometimes, when i look at my hands my mind tell me this is not how they're supposed to look. It makes me slit my wrists trying to get the blood out of me. Recently the same thing started to happen with faces around me. I look at someone and it hits me that this is not how one should look. I look at my skin and it feels unfamiliar. But its so pretty! Im usually cheerfull, but i have periods where i get very depressed for months, start having suicidal thoughts. Its like there is no in-between. About 90% of the time there are intrusive thoughts in my mind, telling me to just kill myself. I've made it a game - i gave those thoughts bodies, theyre dark blue and green hedgehogs. I pretend that its their job to tell me to kill myself, so i can usually brush them kff pretty easy, by locking them up in their cages. Its all in my mind anyway. There is also a ghost in my room who wants to kill me. Ive made friends with her. She still hates me. I don't care. My walls are lovers. \nI feel like im mad, but when i try to tell someone they don't believe me. I feel like im high most of the time despite being clean. Maybe i just have wild imagination. Its not always funny. I don't know what to do. Yesterday i had a chat with random person on the bus about the matrix. He was one of those people who talk to themselves in public. We became friends, i think. We were both the same. \nToday the classroom was shaking and no one else seemed to notice. Everything is spinning. It has been spinning a lot for the past months. I tried to admit myself to an asylum but they need parental permission. Also in my country the asylums look like they're frim a horror movie. They're so pretty! \nSome days i feel like im on the verge of completely losing it. Other days i try to get a break from living by just existing. So really, am i crazy? What do i do? I've tried to attempt once when the depression got me good, but realised i couldn't do it. The voices don't bother me much but there are some moments. Makes me a danger to myself. \nPs. I know this sounds like a fanfic written by a 12 years old. Im sorry. I also apologise for any errors.",

She always tells me the truth eventually, but there have been times where it takes a second to come out. \n\nTo make matters worse, she reconnected with a toxic ex-partner and met up with them recently to relapse. And I don’t say “toxic ex” out of jealousy; this person is objectively terrible and destroyed my friend’s life while they were together. \n\nI want to believe her when she tells me she isn’t going to see this person again and “doesn’t even want to” yet I can’t shake the feeling that she could be lying to my face like she technically has before. \n\nAnyway, because of all this I obviously really worry about her… and this morning has now been the second time that I’ve checked to see if her car was where it’s supposed to be. Yesterday I did it when I intentionally drove past her workplace and this morning I did it when I intentionally drove past her apartment complex to see if her car was in the usual parking spot.\n\nI have ADHD and was diagnosed with depression and a generalized anxiety disorder years ago, but I’ve never come close to doing anything this extreme.

During this time I also felt in constant arguments and having issues with many friends and family feeling very distance from everyone and everything. I spent a substantial amount of time alone particularly in December of last year where throughout the large majority of the month I was isolated. I had many emotions during this time and admittedly struggled deeply being told that I should seek professional help\n\nFast forward to mid February the emotion I was feeling began to fade and began to feel emotionless in short. Since then I have got a new job and a possible route back into education with a new possible relationship on the horizon aswell but I still don’t feel any different. I used to feel the need to connect with someone and find happiness in various field in my life and now those goals mean nothing to me and past activities such as nights out and social events don’t interest me or give me the joy the used to. I used to hate the feeling of isolation and loneliness but now I’m very unbothered by it and do not care wether I spend a hole day inside or if I meet up with friends and family. In addition iv also noticed this in scenarios such as arguments or debates were in unbothered and in this exact emotionless state were I feel I should be angry or upset \n\nI’m not sure if this bothers me or not but I suppose I’m just more curious to see what others believe the situation to be from an outside perspective \n\n",

It’s hard for me to talk about in therapy. How I saw the texts and how he fucked his new gf (who he cheated on me with) in his car. How everyone took his side. How we broke up since I didn’t want to send him nudes after my uncle beat my mom infront of me. How much I got blamed for everything when at the same time the majority of his time was with the girl he cheated on me with. How my slut sister caught feelings for him.  \n",

Hydroxyzine 10-20mg helps me calm down at least.\n\nI tried Olanzapine 2.5mg yesterday, and my mind isn't in turmoil anymore. It's a relief that I feel calm and normal for once. This feels like a good thing, but I started reading other people's experiences on reddit/drugs.com. Their withdrawal symptoms are scary, and it seems like it can cause permanent severe insomnia (along with brain shrinkage in some studies?). It seems this can also happen with just a few weeks usage.\n\nMy psychiatrist didn't tell me this, he just said olanzapine was going to be a nervous system regulator for me at night. I'm thinking that I definitely don't want to take it for two weeks consistently (before our next appt). I would rather take Seroquel if it seems like antipsychotics would truly help me. My friend has been on it for 7 years, and it seems like its side effects are much better. I was wondering if anyone here has similar experiences in their life journey, or has used olanzapine before? And what you're diagnosed with. Thank you!",

I have a good family with loving parents, siblings that are…well…siblings. I have a comfortable life, I have had support for doing the things I wanted, I live in a very good country, I never experienced any traumatic event, no random deaths of relatives.\n\nMy father has depression so I am predisposed to it but everything I listed should have avoided it ?

I have a whole life and many talents but the whole time im involved in anything not related to men, im thinking the whole time what they would think. If I paint a picture im wondering what their thinking. At work I daydream and imagine I brought my man into work that day for whatever reason! Like ill imagine myself touring him around. And thats with every. Damn.  Guy. It’s humiliating. It scares off every guy. As I get older im able to be more closed off and mature but I still get hurt every day. I just want it all to stop. No matter how much i accept it it won’t go away. But i do tell myself “this is affecting me bc it’s something deeper” if i ever cry over something stupid. I can’t go on a date with a guy without me fearing him leaving if he goes to the bathroom. God forbid a guy shows up late too bc ill imagine that they’re blowing me off. It’s constant, it’s everyday, it’s only with men I want or have a relationship with. It seems like no matter how hard I try this is something I just can’t change. Also this guy I like a lot rn had to go to to his car to get something and I literally panicked the whole time he left, even tho he literally left all his belongings inside. It’s irrational and makes no sense. I fear being left so much and I just want to move on with my life!!!!!",

I really don’t have a “reason”. The stress in my life is fairly light. I’ve worked hard to simplify my life and reduce my stress. I’ve developed coping skills to deal with the bad stuff and great boundaries professionally and in my relationships to deal with my people pleasing. I do have an amazing support system and I am blessed with loved ones I can always count on. My suicidal thoughts are intrusive with absolutely no meaning or reasoning. My brain just tells me that I shouldn’t be here. \n\nWhen the er doc asked me what’s causing my thoughts I tell him that I don’t know. He’s surprised. He continues and asks why I want to die. Again, I say I don’t know, my brain just tells me this. He CHUCKLES and said you don’t have a reason? Are you stressed? Is work hard? Having trouble with money or relationships? Again I say, I don’t know why I’m thinking this, and that’s why I’m in the ER. I think he caught himself and goes into the whole talk about self care and balance and having hobbies to help your mental health. \n\nI guess I wasn’t distressed enough and my bloodwork was fine: they gave me something for my headache and an Ativan, plus I had a nap and they released me and told me to follow up with a psych appointment. \n\nNow I’m sitting here a little calmer due to the Ativan but upset at the afternoon I spent in the er with no real help and the bill I’ll soon be getting.

Eventually it got better after a positive experience with psilocybin in 2018 but still had this anxiety and fear running in the background somewhat.\n\nFast forward to now, I’ve been working from home for 4 years and have become increasingly socially isolated. These days, I get anxious even when my partner’s home.\n\nI used to call up family and friends and have fun chatting etc but now I just feel so depressed and full of dread. If I’m talking to someone, I can be ‘present’ but do find myself very weary and on edge. What do I do? I’ve never felt so alone and unable to connect or be happy.",

    "body": "Hello Reddit. I have quite a bit of trauma growing up. Put up for adoption at 7 due to my bio-moms mental illness (abandoned by bio dad prior to being born). Adoptive mom passing away when I was 11 and my adoptive dad abandoning me at 12. Friends parents who's couch I was sleeping in kicked me out at 14 and I was homeless between 14-16 discovered as a homeless youth and adopted again on my 17th birthday to be kicked out at 18 with very little contact. \n\nI'm now in my countries military and find socializing extremely difficult and caring about others even more difficult. I want to be able to have friendships and genuine connections and be able to work well with others. Every single slight social interaction scares the hell out of me unless I'm beyond drunk. I know I'm very smart but if you tried having a conversation with me you would be very convinced I'm dumb as a rock. I'm not sure if I should seek therapy or if I just need to grow up and get my shit together or both idk. I want your thoughts.\n\nAlso when I do make friends and make an effort to socialize I always end up in a situation where I feel like having friends is draining and I'd rather just be alone all the time but now that I'm in the military, I don't have the luxury of working a job where I don't have the interact with many people so I know I need to figure something out but idk how. \n",

What is the approval process like?\n\nI am a 45f and have been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder, Bipolar Type 2, GAD, and Fibromyalgia. I have never been arrested, never been to jail, and never hospitalized. I have almost always had a job and almost always had my own apartment and my own vehicle.\n\nHowever...\n\nI can barely take care of myself. I have not showered in over a year. I do not cook, clean, do laundry, go grocery shopping or into any store for that matter. I am extremely lucky that I found my partner of 12 years and he does not hold this against me. Before I met him, I had slept with well over 150 people, male and female. I am scared to death of being alone.\n\nI have been to college 4 times and I have dropped out 4 times. I have had 27 different jobs, ranging from 1 day to 4 years. I have been fired at least 10 times. I have always had trouble with attendance and have signed many attendance contracts. \n\nEven though I have usually had my own place, I have moved 23 different times since turning 19. I would usually only stay long enough that the place got so dirty I couldn't stand it.  So instead of cleaning, I would just move (unless I was kicked out for being late on rent, which also happened several times). The only reason I have never been homeless or hospitalized is because I have supportive family members.\n\nI have isolated myself so much that I no longer have any friends. The only person I talk to aside from my partner is my mom.\n\nEven though my partner does not have a drivers license (but I do), he is the only one that drives because I have too much anxiety behind the wheel.\n\nOver the last 10 years, I have been working from home because I have a hard time getting ready every day and being around people. Before getting laid off this last Sept, I have only been working part time. I've been unemployed for 5 months and I only have 3 weeks left of unemployment benefits. I'm having a really hard time finding a new job and my mental and physical health have greatly deteriorated. \n\nI know that most people are denied disability the first time they apply.

We had a child together and he was only getting worse so we separated for about three years. I had hoped he would use that time to reflect and figure himself out while he had fewer responsibilities. He stopped drinking after two DUIs but was still very obviously depressed and kept losing jobs. He told me he was probably going to be homeless and sounded so hopeless that I asked him to move back in with us as long as he kept not drinking and got into therapy. It took him over 6 months but he got into therapy and has been doing minor housework and being home to take our kid to and from school. \n\nWell a little bit ago he was doing some electrical work around the house and we started talking about him getting into that field of work like an apprenticeship. He liked the idea and did the testing and had an interview scheduled for this morning. But last night got very emotional about the idea of going down this road and said he actually wanted to do something else. I said okay we’ll call around tomorrow after the interview and see about getting into that field instead. But you should still see the interview through in case being there and hearing more makes you feel better about it. I sent him a good luck text this morning and he replied saying he was sorry but he couldn’t go to the interview. I know this probably has a lot to do with his anxiety and depression but I’m feeling like he’s never going to get back out into the world.

It feels like no matter how much I try to be sure of something, there's always doubt lingering. What really throws me off is that I can't seem to escape the feeling that *even people who are not mentally sound* can be convinced of their own clarity or normalcy. For example, the idea that *stupid* people never question their own intelligence, or that *crazy* people truly believe they are normal, can send me spiraling into self-doubt.\n\nI grew up with a mother who had schizophrenia, and she was completely convinced of her delusions, which was extremely unsettling. I often find myself trapped in this paradox: how can we ever be certain of anything, when even those who are mentally unwell believe they are right?\n\nDoes anyone else experience this kind of thinking? How do you cope with the fact that it's impossible to be 100% certain about everything? Does the ambiguity cause you a sense of deep distress, or do you find ways to tolerate it?",

I know she blames herself for how severely mentally ill I am, but she never did anything to actually change or confront her own trauma which her own mom inflicted on her and genuinely still does to this day. All she did was get onto antidepressants. She lives in the different country and doesn't even call me, I am the one who needs to initiate the calls.

The problem is I have gone through some issues in my life and some ongoing, I have OCD, PMDD gone through some surgeries for my uterus and have painful periods cramps. My bf on the other hand has had a easier life and he doesn't really do well in stressful situations, a small thing like minor fight with a random person in street would make his mood godown and small physical injuries also would hurt him a lot. Even in our relationship, if we fight or have an argument he can't really handle it and he says it's fucks his mood up and he's sensitive like that. He wants to have a lots of fun and would avoid anything that's uncomfortable or stressful even at the slightest. He has himself said he is not emotionally mature. He also has listening problems like he won't listen fully to you and would often cut you off even though he has worked on that problem and has come so far for me. I mask my mental health struggle so well and I often felt alone and unheard in this relationship and I asked him to check up on me now and then and he does that and he tells me I can talk to him and open up but the times I did I never felt understood and I feel like he's doing it just bc I have asked him to. The main problem here for me is, if he has not faced any life challenge and trust me I come with challenges like mental ups and downs and physical struggles I need some support, how will he be there for me when I need him? I need an emotionally mature, understanding and listening man to be with so he can see that I'm struggling and is there for me.

    "body": "I (40F) am sort of a walking assemblage of diagnoses myself, so I get it. I've been that person who people worry about, the one who struggles. I'm lucky that busting my ass in counseling was something I could do and that helped. I'm lucky that I had a great doctor to check in with every quarter, lucky to have her behind me while I got my medication sorted. I just don't know how much my friend \"N\" is capable of making positive changes in her life, and I don't know how to be friends with someone who can't, in so many ways, stop needing so much and ever get \"better\". \n\nMet N (39, NB, I will use different pronouns since she does) about 4.5 years ago or something like that when they were dating someone I know. Moved in fairly quickly because N was living an hour and half away. While N and I were taking a class together, they started to open up big time about their relationship problems. This went on 8 months, hours and hours of talking, until the break up. N stayed with some friends of ours after moving out while she was looking for a new place. Was supposed to be there a month, was there over 3. My friends were expecting a baby at the time and couldn't decorate their nursery because she was in the space.\n\nAfter the break up, there was one big instance of her snapping at me about \"staying friends\" with her ex because I wouldn't stop going to a bimonthly event where he was on the same team as me, nor would I commit to trying to get him kicked out. This was literally the only place I saw him or spoke to him, make 4 hours a month. N was in a good place regarding the ex until after entering a \"relationship sobriety\" 12 step. Suddenly, N went from staying she was fine with possibly attending events where he was soon, to not being able to even attend events he was invited to, needing to check with her sponsor about everything, and resentful of people who \"invited\" him places by sending out invites to an established large group text. They asked me to double check he wasn't going to be at a Christmas party, which I did if not enthusiastically, then bitched to a friend that they hadn't felt supported because I hadn't gushed while doing it I guess.\n\nThere's a lot I will have to leave out, but N is hyper focused on being social to the detriment of her well being. When she finally rests, she stays in bed until 1:00 PM or 2:00 PM. Their apartment is disgusting half the time, and I don't think their dog is always getting the proper attention. N recently called me at 1:00 AM saying her bipolar symptoms were severe and I told her to go to the hospital and let me know she was there. She did, then dropped off the face of the earth so I had to call around to hospitals to find her. Thankfully they were fine and went home at lunch time. The next day, N asks me if I can watch her dog the following Saturday night so she can go to a party after her second job. I say no, and am secretly fuming. Why is this person not at all focused on counseling or resting or anything to get well when they were just in the hospital with a mental health crisis the night before? Another friend tells me that N didn't get admitted because she couldn't miss work. I had off work randomly the next Tuesday and ran into her. Said they had taken off for a mental health day. Great, we should all do that. But why is that suddenly possible when the week before when they were in the hospital with doctors who could help them, it wasn't possible?\n\nRecently, a friend had a birthday party and we all agreed to specifically have it on a Sunday and not Saturday because of N's work schedule and picked one around the friend's birthday. N committed to being there, then a few days later, remembered there was an improv event they wanted to go to on that day. She actually asked if it was possible to reschedule for the upcoming Sunday 3 days away. She asked someone else to reschedule a birthday because there was something else she wanted to do. They asked 4 other people to change their schedules to fit what they wanted to do. Birthday girl explains the reservation is paid for and N still decides to go to the imrpov bullshit and cost our friend the money paid for the reservation. Now, N offered to pay the birthday girl back, but come on. The improv thing was totally a choice and after all picked this day especially in consideration of her, and she knew a reservation had been made and paid for, choosing the dumb improv event was rude as hell. \n\nI resent N so much at this point. I hate that I am starting to hate this smart, talented person because they're exhausting, needy, disorganized, and inconsiderate. ",

I hate having labels that make people want me to not go out and actually do stuff. They're too concerned. I'm an adult. They think bad stuff is going to happen to me. I think the over concern is the cause of my issues. I'm not allowed to just go out and make friends or even date. It's so irritating. I'm the unreasonable one for questioning it though. Sometimes I want to just leave and not talk to my family for like a month. \n\nI don't think I'm doing that bad. They just want me on meds because they don't like a part of me.

I've liked him since I was 14, and Since I was 16 I was multiple times rejected by him, he's the kindest man I've known. He wasn't rude about rejecting me he either avoided the argument or did it kindly, that makes me only fall more for him. I'm convinced that we have our really sweet moments and a lot of romantic tension. (Or maybe I'm delusional)\n\n I'm jealous he has other female friends, and I hate some of his friends which I think may be one of the reasons I got rejected (btw I don't hate his friends because I'm jealous but because they're downright creeps) and I full on hated him when he protected his friend (a lot older btw) who was being a creep and an asshole to me and he always stands up for that friend who treats him like shit and never for me.\n\nHe's so kind but lately I start thinking he's more a coward than a good soul. He's a bit challenged too. When someone confronts him on anything serious he doesn't dare to open his mouth not even  for breathing.\n\nI'm mean sometimes just because I want to see him stand up for himself (and because I'm pissed at him too) but he never does, it makes me mad.\n\nI've been in a relationship after he rejected me once  and it was kinda terrible, and then after it confessed my feeling when drunk but he completely ignored me.\n\nI also think a lot about sex, and that makes me feel so guilty because he's obviously not only not into me but not into relationships, sex or girls in general. But I can't stop, it makes me sick how much I daydream about him and I can't stop no matter how much I date or hookup.\n\nI want to date him so much but I know that of he gives me a chance I will ruin him and I don't want to ruin him.\n\nOur shared friends (who hangout more with me) say I'm a really toxic person, and I know, I wish I was toxic and unaware because being aware of it makes it all worse, I wish someone to understand I don't mean to be malicious.

    "body": "Hey, 20 F here. I have been diagnosed with both anxiety and depression in the past, so I take Wellbutrin daily. My concern is somewhat...strange(?) because I don't know what this is tied to.\n\nEveryday I HAVE to change my phone around. So, wallpaper, app placement, light/dark mode. I delete and install apps, even reinstall ones I've deleted. I haven't gone a single day without doing so, in years.\n\n***I'm always beating myself up or in distress over something. Things that I don't even know why they're stressing me to the point of tears.***\n\nLately, its the fact that I don't know Chinese or can't get myself to enjoy studying it (note: *I am NOT Asian.* I'm Latina, but have always enjoyed Asian media and culture. I had like a month and a half in the beginning of 2024 that I enjoyed learning simplified Chinese). So now, anytime I try to watch a Chinese drama or listen to an OST, I force myself to stop because the thoughts of NEEDING to know the language are too overwhelming. I end up going on my phone and forcing myself to study until I'm exhausted and can't stand it. Literally have had no fun learning it these past two weeks but when I stop I get so distressed-- same thing happens when I do try though, its a daily tug-of-war. This happened with Korean-- when was OBSESSED with k-pop, Japanese--anime, manga, japanese baseball, Russian--literally liked ONE Russian character and enjoyed watching figure skating, etc. Then I start thinking about people who are learning it, who are capable of reading it, and how they're SO much better than me and the cycle repeats. I stop learning and listen to a song and the need begins again. I don't know if this is because of a self-worth issue, or because of my innate interest in Asia since I was younger? But I'm losing it daily. I delete my language learning app, reinstall, repeat. Guilt arises, I reinstall. Stress and unhappiness over the forced learning, delete. I see someone else learning it? Reinstall. Etc. It doesn't help when I see people say that simply knowing Spanish as a second language isn't as good anymore (as it's my second lang that I'm fluent in), so I start getting insecure...it never ends. On top of this, I tend to learn pronunciation in other languages relatively...easily? So I think about having potential at learning it and stress about NOT learning it because I want to prove that I'm capable?\n\nI can't draw without feeling guilty. I can't keep learning ASL because my brain goes to the other language. I can't play a game without feeling like a waste of time. I can't listen to my usual music since I feel like I'm just \"going backwards\" instead of improving(?) -- so I guess, listening to Chinese music to enhance immersion would be going \"forward\" in this point of time for me. I feel like I'm obsessed with self-improvement/productivity or something because I overanalyze everything I do now and feel bad if I don't think it'll give me huge benefits in the future.\n\nWhen the year STARTED, my stress was about my sexuality out of nowhere. I'm telling you, the second I woke up on Jan 1st. I don't know where it came from, but it was a 24/7 stressor. To the point where it was all I watched on YouTube or looked up online. After that subsided around mid Feb, this began. I'm so mentally exhausted and feel so strange because idk why I am like this. I have breakdowns daily because I just don't know HOW to stop this. Maybe I can avoid exposure to the language/culture until I can regulate how I feel, idk.\n\nAny...advice? Probably just therapy huh.",

Say get up to make food at 6:00, and if i dont get up at exactly 6:00, then i have to wait for 6:30. Sometimes on bad days if i miss my original time then i cant get up until im starving and shaking from it and Need to eat. A less extreme version of that is that if im getting up to do something, it has to be when the clock is at :00, :15, :30, or :45, or else i cant get up. Another example is laundry day, but if i dont do laundry that day, then my brain says that i Cant do it until next saturday or up until I Absolutely Have To because i have no clothes for the next day. \n\nI dont know whats stopping me but i feel like im somewhat paralyzed or forbidden from doing whatever it is unless its a specific time/day. Unless i have permission. Permission/direction from someone overrides everything and i can immediately go and do it no matter what time or day but unless i ask for it, it doesnt happen. Often times i just struggle until i absolutely have to do something because there is no option to Not do it. And often times my fragile schedule will fall apart afterwords. My thought process kinda goes \"well i didnt stick with the schedule so why do anything ever again\" and i just lay in bed with the inability to get up and do the thing\n\nIve been diagnosed with anxiety, depression, adhd, and autism. Is this a symptom of one of those? It helps me know terms for what im experiencing and it relieves my anxiety and some stress over it, plus it allows me to do more research and find ways to help me.

I'm curious about what people think about this as well but also I feel the need to share this with some people as well as it feels... disturbing? (for the lack of a more explanatory word) to keep it inside for 17 years.\\]\n\n\\----------------------\n\nSo, it might look like it but this is seriously not a shitpost. I'm just trying to be directed towards the right path to understand a part of myself that I haven't thought about much in a long while but suddenly came to my mind.\n\nAlso, my posts usually don't take off anyway if this post already has some upvotes, please don't upvote it any more. I really don't want this to be seen at the front page of the subreddit as the thought of that feels disturbing.\n\nAnyways, without making myself too comfortable in the process, I always had a thing for thinking about unconscious/passed out women as long as I knew myself, like even around 4 or 5 as said in the title. I would dream about that stuff in the primary school and even a clearer example was how I dragged a girl around on the floor (just at normal speed) while we were playing (with her agreeing to play of course) (and we were of course both 4 or 5) and she was acting like she was a fish and I hunted her (silly, I know but kids are kids) in the kindergarten. And I enjoyed that \"game\" we played, like, a lot. Carrying her around like that was so... hot? It can't be at that time as the thing down there wasn't working yet, but it was so enjoyable in a way I can't describe. There were also scenes from the cartoons I watched I would later find from the internet or desperately wait for the scene to appear again TV that included similar or the same things that gave me this same feeling.\n\nWhat's weirder is that, I've been interested in similar kinks as long as I entered puberty, still to this day. Now, I know the fundamentals of this stuff to some degree, at least. I'm not claiming to be an expert but I'm just trying to stay informed. I've done a lot of reading about it even though I didn't get a chance to partake in a scene so far. I know that the trust and consent are the keys, and the importance of safewords and the traffic light system, or something equivalent, and I of course wouldn't try to act out these kinks I didn't mention with someone who doesn't agree to them. Maybe I'm getting too defensive and making too detailed explanations here without a particular reason, but I just don't want to come off as a creep, better to be safe than sorry.\n\nSo, what might have caused this interests? I'm not asking for a diagnosis as that's impossible to do through internet. It's just... I trust my therapist but there are still stuff I can't talk face to face with him. Like, my mind just goes in a protection mode where I have a hard time analyzing those topics I try to bring to the table, I just lose all my thinking energy that's needed for critical thinking out of stress and my defense mechanism based on some events in the past; but this is a lot easier to do when you're doing this on the internet for obvious reasons. I just wanna try to start from somewhere.",

I have one trait that has been with me absolutely all my life (this is important to keep in mind, as some people may mistake my personality trait as a consequence of something having happened to me at some point in my life). I don't feel empathy towards real people I might meet in life, for example. For the most part, I don't understand the emotions they feel, or I myself don't feel compassion if they have something going on (even if it's someone in my family), but that doesn't mean I hate them. I just can't, I don't know how to force myself to be different. Even though there were more negative moments, I can't really talk about it, but I remember not feeling anything for any people since I was a kid. There wasn't some event that made me this way, it just is, and always has been. \nBut for all that, I am capable of experiencing very deep feelings similar to empathy for inanimate objects and animals. For example, I would be heartbroken if I saw someone stepping on a flower or hurting an animal. When I see something like that, most of the time I start crying and run away somewhere just to avoid seeing it. I also have a hard time getting rid of unwanted items because I feel like I'm betraying them and they are forever alone. Also, on top of that, I can feel something similar about characters when I watch movies, even though they are people. I can't say I understand all the emotions they feel, but I get hurt when my favorite character dies or something bad happens to them. I probably see characters from movies more as \"inanimate\" since with real people in real life I do lack empathy. No doubt I have some very horrible thoughts and ideas, and I also believe in a lot of things that are morally \"wrong\", but I don't see the point in talking about them now. Still, I'd be interested to know what something like this can be called, and whether it can be called \"low empathy\" in general. ",

If you’re even thinking about going there, or know someone who is, please—**DO NOT.** Here’s why:\n\n# 1. They’re Dodging Taxes Like It’s a Game\n\nThese guys are straight-up **scamming the system**. They’ve got all sorts of tricks to avoid paying taxes—fake invoices, cash payments to dodge GST, and even fudging their books to make it look like they aren’t making money. They’re literally **breaking the law** to save a buck. It’s disgusting.\n\n# 2. Employees Are Getting Ripped Off\n\nAnd it’s not just the government they’re screwing over—they’re **totally screwing over their employees** too. They play around with salaries to avoid giving people their rightful Provident Fund (PF) and don’t even bother registering employees for Employee State Insurance (ESI). People are getting paid in cash with no records, no benefits, and no protections. It’s a mess.\n\n# 3. Patients Are at Risk Here\n\nIf you care about your mental health, **stay far away** from Athena. They’re not even **properly licensed** to provide care, and they’re handing out meds without proper documentation or supervision by licensed professionals. They’re also faking insurance claims, so it’s not just bad—it’s **dangerous**.\n\n# 4. They Don’t Even Follow Basic Health Standards\n\nThey claim to be accredited, but that’s **complete BS**. They don’t meet any of the necessary standards for running a mental health facility. They don’t have qualified staff, their buildings aren’t up to code, and they don’t even follow basic health and safety rules. They’re lying to everyone, and it’s **unsafe**.\n\n# 5. They’re Hiding Money and Financials\n\nIt gets worse. They’re using **fake shell companies** to hide money and avoid taxes. They’re literally trying to cover up their financial tracks to make sure no one finds out what they’re really doing behind the scenes. This is not just shady—it’s illegal.\n\n# 6. They Don’t Care About Patients or Consumers\n\nOn top of all that, they **ignore** complaints from patients. If you’re overcharged, mistreated, or just want to know what’s going on with your care or billing, **good luck**. They don’t give a damn about their patients or consumers. It’s all about making money for them.\n\n# Bottom Line: Don’t Trust Them\n\nIf you value your health or your money, do yourself a favor and stay far away from **Athena Behavioral Health**. They’re not just a bad business—they’re **breaking laws, hurting people, and getting away with it**. Spread the word. Don’t let anyone you know get sucked into this scam.\n\nJust stay away.

It's the same thing with my hand, it looks like it's several feet away even if it's only a few inches. \n The times I remember it being triggered the most is when I was getting yelled at/lectured for longer periods of time (15-25 minutes) But that's not the only time it's happened. It also happens when I talk about it, I remember telling my sister about it when suddenly it started happening, same thing with my doctor and with my friend.

My sister doesn't talk to me much and I only have one friend and we only talk through the phone. I don't get to talk to people much because of this. I'm also very mentally ill. I have anxiety, ADHD/Autism OCD and at some point depression. I also have this other thing were my brain will find small things to worry about for weeks or even months on end and no matter how much I try to talk myself out of it, it still remains and lingers in the back of my head, almost 24/7, I have no idea what it's called but it happens very often and it started ever since I found fetish/vore content when I was 6 on the internet. It hurts a lot to deal with at times and it recently came back and I feel awful. I cope with my problems by talking to people but there's nobody. I've been to a psych ward before and I liked it because there was finally people o could talk to and I miss that sense of community. I just wish I had a support group. ",

    "title": "prolonged grief, chaos&hell",
    "body": "\nBefore I begin, I just want to say that this is going to be a very chaotic vent filled with self-pity. I’ve never shared these feelings in real life, not even with a therapist or anyone, because I feel so ashamed of myself. But I need to get this out. If you’re reading this, I apologize in advance for making you go through this jumble of thoughts.\n—————————\n\nalso possible TW? (death/loss/self-harm/ED/SI) \n\n\n⸻——————-\n\n\n\n\nThe only reason I keep going is because I don’t want to destroy my parents. I can’t bear the thought of putting my mom through all of this. I feel selfish for wanting to give up when I know there are people around me who care and want to see me fight through it.\n\nAt the same time, I don’t feel like I deserve to feel like this. I feel like I haven’t suffered enough to warrant healing or anything of that sort.\n\nI’m still mourning my silent attempts, the ones that hurt me deeply, but I stayed quiet. I never spoke up. They weren’t loud or dramatic attempts, and I guess because of that, I feel like they don’t matter. I’ve struggled with an eating disorder for years, but I’m not even underweight. In fact, right now, I’m overweight, and it feels like I’m failing at everything.\n\nMy self-harm? Yeah, it’s bad, but is it really that bad? I’ve never had to go to the hospital. I’ve never had stitches. Most of my scars are shallow now.\n\nBut the thing is, I’ve been overlooked and dismissed my entire life. People don’t care until you’re on the verge of losing everything. I’ve had a licensed therapist tell me that my scars weren’t serious compared to her other clients. I’ve had people tell me that my grief isn’t justified.\n\nYes, people validated my grief when I lost both of my grandparents, especially my grandmother, who was like my second mom. But even then, I felt like I had no right to grieve. My mom lost both of her parents in a short span of time, and I couldn’t help but feel like my grief wasn’t as valid as hers.\n\nWhen it comes to pets, especially smaller ones, some people just don’t understand. \nThey say, “It’s just a pet, you’ll get over it,” but I didn’t lose a pet. I lost my best friend, my purpose, my reason to keep going. Losing my first cat wasn’t just a loss; it was everything.\n\nAs for friendships, people just say, “People come and go.” “It’s not like they died.” \nBut the truth is, I lost the most meaningful and authentic relationships I’ve ever had. I lost the people I trusted enough to truly be myself around, the ones who knew me in a way no one else ever did.\n\nLately, I’ve been feeling incredibly alone. I’m about to drop out of college, and all the grief I’ve been suppressing is surfacing. I’ve been dissociating and numbing myself for so long that it feels like everything is hitting me all at once. On top of that, I’m moving out on my own, and I’m slowly losing contact with my roommate, the only friend I still have.\n\nLook at me, though—how pathetic it is that I can’t just shake off this self-pity. Here I am, venting on reddit like it’s some kind of cry for attention.",

    "body": "Hi there. I'm a 30-year-old man and was diagnosed with Major Depression and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. I hospitalized myself back in December for suicidal thoughts and had the flu at the time. They put me on Latuda and Sertraline and told me it was Bipolar 2. I feel whatever for the next 2 months. Got 2 therapists surprisingly, one for EMDR and one for CBT, a psychiatrist (after cycling through 3), and waiting for a peer support program.\n\nI switched from 60mg of Prozac to 50 mg of Sertraline and 20 mg of Latuda in the hospital back in December, and the first month and a half of that made me feel less anxious about everything, but the depression was definitely still there, along with some intrusive thoughts every now and then. 2 weeks ago, my psychiatrist outside the hospital told me I most likely am dealing with just Major Depression and took me off of the Latuda and upped my Sertraline to 100 mg. She said if I'm not feeling better by this coming Thursday, up it again to 150mg.\n\nWhen I stopped the Latuda, the first 2 days I felt fine. The next 2 days I slept over 30 hours total. Then the next 6 days leading up to now have been insanely bad for me.\n\nMonday: Just felt groggy I believe\n\nTueday: Water got shut off and I had the urge to cry the entire day, and when I got back from errands and appointments, I burst out crying for about 10 minutes straight. Thought I was going to need to go back to the hospital because suicidal thoughts came up again, but after crying I felt a little better.\n\nWednesday: I woke up feeling really crappy and intrusive thoughts were really bad (mornings have been the worst part of the day for me this week). Felt a little better later on.\n\nThursday: I think this day was the day I started to not feel like myself. I feel like I've changed somehow, or maybe I'm starting to dissociate. I'm not completely sure, but the mental gymnastics and rumination start here.\n\nFriday: The feeling intensifies, and I just have intrusive thoughts questioning everything I've done, am doing, and will do. I start to feel like I've lost my morals and values and am just a blank canvas waiting to be painted evil and paranoid by my intrusive thoughts.\n\nSaturday (Today): I wake up from a dream where I felt no emotions from all the craziness happening around me. Almost all day I've felt like I've become, or am becoming, a changed person and don't hold any of the values I used to have. Like I'm just waiting for something to happen to me and that will define who I become, or I'll just start accepting the intrusive thoughts as fact and become that person. This feels like my soul is caged by a wicker basket and the intrusive thoughts are trying to crush it until I change, for better or worse.\n\nGuess I'm writing all this out for anyone that has had similar experiences, maybe? Or just advice on things that could help me? I haven't written to this board before, but I'd like to hear any replies, honestly. I'm also sorry if this is typed out poorly. Thank you.",

    "body": "\nText:\nI (23M) was in a relationship with my ex (22F) for a year. We loved each other intensely, almost foolishly. She was a genuinely amazing person—supportive, kind, and loving. She stood by me even when I had doubts, and I struggled because she had so many great qualities. But suddenly, everything changed, and now it feels like I never existed to her.\n\nThe Biggest Issue in Our Relationship:\n\nFrom the start, my struggle was acceptance—I didn’t feel 100% sure about her. I liked her, but I kept questioning whether she was \"the one.\" She knew about my hesitation and was patient, believing we could work through it.\n\nDespite my doubts, we were deeply connected. I was incredibly supportive of her, especially during her mental health struggles. I went to therapy, both for myself and to understand her condition. I tried everything to make this relationship work, and she did the same for me.\n\nWhat Happened to Her? (A Breakdown in Steps)\n\n1. She stopped taking her medication (Carbalt) in late January 2025.\n\n\n2. She entered a phase of unusual energy, confidence, and hyperactivity—a stark contrast to her usual withdrawn self.\n\n\n3. Then, she faced multiple personal crises:\n\nFights with her family.\n\nConflict with an old friend (who was also the sister of her ex).\n\n\n\n4. She started showing drastic personality changes:\n\nBecame aggressive, impulsive, and confrontational.\n\nStarted swearing more and posting bizarre videos with confusing statements.\n\nChanged her online identity and dressed differently.\n\n\n\n5. A few days later, she broke up with me, saying:\n\n\"We were lying to ourselves. Your eyes were never fully on me.\"\n\n\"This relationship wasn’t right for us.\"\n\n\n\n6. I simply asked her not to talk about me on TikTok. She reacted by:\n\nSending me a 5-minute voice note full of insults.\n\nBlocking me everywhere.\n\n\n\n\nHow I Tried to Help\n\nEven after she blocked me, I knew something was wrong. I contacted her therapist, who then reached out to her family. They couldn’t find her for hours.\n\nI went to another doctor near her home for advice.\n\nI helped track her phone location to get her safely to the hospital.\n\nShe was hospitalized for weeks.\n\n\nMeanwhile, she started messaging one of my old friends, someone I had past conflicts with because she used to be overly friendly with him. She told him everything about our relationship, even though she once said:\n\n\"If I ever leave you, I’ll disappear from your life completely, including your friends.\"\nNow, they still talk to this day.\n\n\nAfter She Got Out of the Hospital\n\nShe reopened social media but removed me instead of blocking me this time.\n\nWhen I saw her stories, she removed me completely.\n\nShe acts as if I never existed.\n\n\nWhat Her Cousin Told Me (Who Still Talks to Her)\n\nI reached out to her cousin, Randa, who told me:\n\nShe still holds resentment toward anyone who was around her during her crisis.\n\nShe believes everyone who tried to help actually hurt her.\n\nShe isn’t ready to face people who remind her of that period.\n\n\nEdit : I didn't ask for the diagnosis as the therapist told me that his ethics can't allow him doing that, I didn't ask her cousin and i really need to know what happened but it seems in our culture that may be i will be an Intruder as We didn't get married or even plan seriously to do so we were just in a romantic relationship and literally fixing my sight and acceptance for here at therapy sessions cause we both wanted to continue but I didn't dully accept her, she knew all of that ,even though she loved and accepted the state as it was till we figure it out.\n\n\n🌀For what really happened after all of that month at the hospital, I couldn't ask her family about her due to our society restrictions , I was praying for ger for a month and giving her such excuses as she wasn't normal at doing these actions , then I was surprised after a month that she was talking to that friend that we struggled due to him , then appearing on social media and removing me from Instagram and Facebook and interacting with these friend and here other friends like Don't care about my reaction...\nEven though that friend came and told me everything and said to me that he respected my My existence back in her life so not treating her like she will not be his gf \nBut she is acting like she didn't know me before and I am afraid to talk to her or even seeing her in the university as the therapist said she might take  a bad action against you or I might even see her with another one or in a bad state that hurts me \n\nI EVEN DIDN'T MOVE ON TILL A MONTH LATER without knowing anything about here and just waiting her to heal (which still in progress) and just GIVING HER AN EXCUSE THAT SHE IS ILL , now SHE IS LIVING HER LIFE LOOKING GOOD AND TALKING TO THAT FRIEND AND I'M STUCK HERE DIDN'T EVEN TAKE THE ACTION OF MOVING ON ! \n \nI really so loyal to her but her actions rn are so painful to me despite their reason wether they're due to mental illness or Personal will& personal decision \n\nThe therapist told me that she blocked me when that happened earlier and when she left the hospital she removed me again 🤷🏻\nI think removing is different than blocking for her as she was believing that doors might be opened in the future again and she actually told me that when she blocked me but I'm afraid that these doors might not open again anymore 😭 as chatgpt said that these traumatic people might change with No way back\n---\n\nNow, I’m here, wondering what actually happened.\nDid her mental health shift make her genuinely stop loving me? Was this truly a breakup she wanted, or was it influenced by her condition?\n\nHas anyone else experienced something like this? Can someone just delete you from their life so easily after everything?\n\n",

He had a very bad divorce with a restraining order involved with his ex wife. Probably was not necessary but it is what it is. Long story. He had supervised visitation and lost it bc of his mental health issues. He’s been diagnosed as bipolar 1 but also seems to be slipping into a schizophrenic state. He believes there is a high powered government run gang out to destroy his life and that his ex wife and son have been kidnapped. Nothing further from the truth. My question is: how do you get a 43 year old mentally ill man to see they need help? He thinks nothing is wrong with him and believes all these delusions mentioned - and many more. We have no idea what to do with him after he gets out of jail? My parents are 80. They can’t deal with this. He’s also nasty and just plain mean. What do you do with a person like this? I feel like he’s destined for an early death or being on the streets. Any help is appreciated. I need a plan and ideas to help my parents. ",

(or the other way around?) (also, im pretty sure our breasts hadn't developed yet, so idk if that narrows down the age.) \n\nthen my aunt called us frm the window and i could kind of see her face peaking through the curtains so i rushed to close them properly and we hurried to dress and go down. (this was the reason why i thought i was the one who first hugged her frm behind bc i was the one who closed the curtains.) \n\nthat night, when we got home, i cried myself to sleep. i hated what i did and resented myself for agreeing to even do that. \n\nbut it happened again, idk how far apart they were, probably a few months, like 2-3. and this time i'm sure she was the one who suggested it. i was hesitant, i wanted to say no, but i didnt. instead, i was able to convince her to put something in between our lips. (?) \n\ni know i was at fault, that i agreed to it with no shame when she Was disabled. but i really need some help. idk if i was to blame, hell i dont even know if i was the one to suggest all of that the first time. i wish i hadn't made myself forget, then i would have a clearer picture in my head and more to base my opinions on, but i dont. so please help me. \n\nps: i still had a good relationship with her after that though, i still used to help her in school before i left last year. i just had always hoped she forgot and didn't tell anyone.

    "body": "\nI don't think I'm cut out for life. I don't feel like I'm fit in or in place. I am emotionally sensitive and empathetic. I don't feel like I belong. I can't find a job that pays a liveable wage. I have had a good amount of jobs for my age.  Don't have a driver license yet and I can't afford lessons right now but whats the point if I can't afford a car. Even if I work full time and make 600 a week I still wouldn't be able to afford one.\n\n I am in community college for accounting. I worked 30 hours a week at a pharmacy and made 400 a week still not enough. I can't afford anything and it sucks to know that this is how life is and I would have to work 3 jobs. I reduced my hours to focus on studying but now I can't afford hobbies or all of my needs and definitely not any wants. \n\nRight now I'm still studying but don't know how I will keep paying for college since my father is a tax evader for fafsa. I could do a payment plan but It will be all of my money. I binge eat. I don't have anyone to talk to. I have mental illnesses including depression and when I was on antidepressants I gained lots of weight and binge eating got worse so I stopped. I see a therapist and it doesn't help all they do is just suggest meds. \n\nMy dad is dying and I never grieved my brother committing suicide. I'm lonely but a man could quickly make my life worse and more complicated. All the jobs I've been applying to virtually pay the same $12-18. I'm back to self harming. I feel like a failure and feel guilty for being alive. My parents are abusive but I don't want to have a victim complex. I still live with them and I am not able to afford to move out even with roommates. Maybe my expectations for earning is too high and my standards for life as well.\n\nI went to beauty school to become a certified nail technician just to find that there's virtually no job openings out there for that near me at the moment. Or they are part time working 1-2 days a week. I'm considering selling press ons though but its a saturated market and I don't know who would buy from me. I have had 2 businesses ages 16-20 that flopped. Multiple hobbies that flopped and there is absolutely nothing that I am passionate about or enjoy. I don't enjoy entertainment either.\n\nI'm not sure what to do with my life and how to feel better and I have been forcing myself for the past few weeks to forget every single thing and move forward but I genuinely do not see much to be happy about.\n\nWhen I confided in my friend she said I'm privileged and my life is not that bad and they have it worse. I'm not doubting others have it worse at all. What prompted me to write this post is while searching for a new job because my current one I am very underpaid and staff is toxic and I am sick of abuse from the customers, I realized I still can barely find anything that would allow me to live that I got overwhelmed and cried and my mother said that I need to grow up and asked me how am I going to manage to survive which is true, and I don't think I will to be honest. She also said that me crying causes her stress and said that the stress I cause her and my dad is what turns them to drink. She says I make excuses which I think is true in some cases. I have been dissocoating for the past 6 years and every second every minute every week every month and every year passes by me in seconds. I will wake up one day and be 50 if i make it to then wondering where all the time has gone. \n\nI think the people in my life think I am weak which is true. I'm not even trying to seek pity or be self pity or a victim but I just don't see the point. I am not a victim it is all my fault and I believe any abuse that I have endured I must of have deserved it. I just get easily overwhelmed and I don't know why and I am immature. \n\nI don't know what to do with my life and I need someone to tell me. \n",

    "body": "Hey Reddit, I know the internet is not always the best tool for a mental health diagnosis but I no longer suffer from these symptoms and haven’t for some time so even a false diagnosis would cause no harm, I just want answers out of curiosity. As a child I had severe anger issues, a problem with compulsive lying even if it got me in more trouble than the truth, and whenever my mom would explain to other people how awful I could be I would always act like an angel in public and have great manners but only act bad in my house, I also went through a pyromaniac phase at 11. Not sure if those traits are gonna help towards a conclusion but maybe they will so just dropping that info. I can’t remember the dreams but I remember feeling impending doom after waking up from them and my mom would come in my room and in the middle of the night and said she woke up to me yelling and scratching the wall which I didn’t even know was possible from night terrors. I also up until I turned about fifteen would always see “shadow people” frequently but not clearly, always in my peripheral vision and couldn’t make it out, I’d see the silhouette of a dark figure opening my closed door and then look at my door and my doors still closed and stuff like that. I also valued pets like my dogs just as much if not more so than I did people and still do, I was hard to control so was mostly in my room grounded from 6- 13 years old with my books and my dogs to keep me company so they became my company. I grew up with a single mom working two jobs who was gone before I woke up and home after I was asleep, but we lived with her old friend who we would find out to be a severely sick narcissist, when my mom wasn’t home she would give me the “ slap you and give you candy” treatment. Never physically, but emotionally, she would tell me my mom didn’t believe in me, but she did pretty much, and just wanted to feed into the idea of me hating my mom and liking her as an ego thing. She was a compulsive liar as well who even ate all my Halloween candy one year and blamed it on me so my mom got mad at me since I had an eating disorder. My traits developed around the same time we moved in with her, were these learned from her or was I just this way as a kid. No doctors could give my mom a definitive diagnosis and they just gave me a bunch of treatment drugs like lithium to calm me despite having no idea what was wrong with me. At around 14 I started to lose my anger, and the only thing that made it leave was sadness, because of all the stress I caused my mom and nights she spent crying after I said I hated her, I thought she hated me but it was her friend lying all those years and I felt terrible. Ever since that realization I physically can’t feel “rage” I can get annoyed but I literally haven’t felt true anger since and that also worries me. Sorry for the off topic rant but are these traits or symptoms common with certain diagnosis’?",

    "body": "THIS CONTAINS SELF HARM. I think, not entirely sure? Anyway. To preface: I’m a 15 year old girl and I have already been diagnosed with ADHD and Autism, but this is not my concern. Lately, I have been having very explosive anger outbursts over small things and in result I have been hyperventilating, scratching myself until I bleed, and disassociating heavily. I always have a strong urge to do something big like rip out my hair or punch a hole in my wall or throw my phone at concrete and to cope with these feelings I’ve just been scratching my skin. As an example, today I was watching tv in my living room and my mom came home and turned off the fan that I had on. (She has issues with fans and doesn’t like the way they feel). I got very upset because it was hot in the living room, and I asked her if we could come to a compromise, to which she absolutely refused. It made me super upset for some reason and I felt like the only thing I could do was leave the room before I said or did something I would regret. I had already started crying (for some reason?) before I left the room, and when I did leave the room, my dad said “perfect timing”(meaning now he could take over the tv for himself since I was leaving) and it just made me feel so embarrassed and defeated. I left to my room and hyperventilated/sobbed while throwing things and being incredibly destructive for a good 45 minutes before I decided to take a bath. I was still crying and sobbing heavily when I got into the bath and then I really started scratching my arms. Both arms are now really scratched up and I just feel really stupid for over reacting so terribly. During all of this, I felt out of my body. It felt like my mind would be running with thoughts but I couldn’t control my body or I felt like I was someone else. Along with this, I feel like I am slowly losing my sense of self. I don’t want to do things I usually enjoy and I have no idea what I look like. Some days I think I’m absolutely hideous and I don’t want anyone to see me or even go outside, while other days I think that everyone is looking at me because I look good.. So overall I just feel like I’m losing myself and I don’t know what to do. If anyone reads this, thank you. (I hope I did this right, this is my first Reddit post. Also, I am trying my best to not violate the rules here so, I am not looking for a formal diagnosis but rather some advice on what do to with myself here).",

    "body": "Life is so hard. I feel dark, cold, & alone. I feel like I have no one to talk to. No one that I can trust. I am 43 male. I have issues with anxiety, depression, and ADHD. I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was in elementary school. The same things keep happening to me over and over again. No matter how hard I try to avoid the same mistakes or disasters, they keep happening over and over again. I need help, and I am trying to find the right help. I am tired of getting angry and walking out on my job.\nYou see I keep having these panic attacks. I get angry and do things out of impulse without thinking about it. I would get so angry that I would walk out of my job. Sometimes, I would smash and break things on the way out. Sometimes I would just walk out. I always have a hard time getting along with others or the managers. I always feel like an outcast no matter what I do or try. I got so used to not having friends that it does not matter whether I fit in anymore. I dwell on things too much, even when I try not to. I always take things too personally, even when I try not to. I flip out when I get angry and go crazy. But what's weird? It takes a lot to get me angry. But once I'm angry, I go nuts or wild. The weird part is I'm usually friendly, calm, and laid back until when you piss me off or get on my bad side. Some folks say it sounds like I have different personalities. They would say because there is the calm Me, shy Me, and crazy Me. I also keep getting complaints at work that I'm talking too loud. But to me, I don't sound that loud. I always get complaints about not being fast enough or unable to complete the work. I am very ashamed to talk about these issues I have. But I have to know, is anyone else going through this? And what do you do about it?",

    "body": "I'm not sure this is the right subreddit for this but here I go.\n\nMy entire life I've felt responsible for how everyone around me feels. I'm constantly worrying that I did something wrong or \"immoral\" to someone I care about (or something \"wrong\" in general), and when I do, my whole world falls apart and I feel horribly anxious and paranoid that that means I'm no longer a good person when I've spent my life believing and trying to reflect that.\n\nI can't rock the boat in school either. I've always been a good student and seen almost as a \"teacher's pet\", and even the thought of ruining that is terrifying because to me, that teacher would hate me and I'd ruin my reputation.\n\nMistakes terrify me too, specifically with social situations. In 7th grade, a former friend and I got into an argument with each other, and I let my mouth run to anyone wanting to know what happened. It's been almost 4 years since that and I still feel like she resents me (when she's been nice to me) and that deep down, people still think I'm that idiotic 12 year old.\n\nI feel like everyone is almost \"out to get me\" in a way, even my closest friends. I'm scared the people who know me secretly hate me or are talking shit behind my back.\n\nA little bit ago, my bsf's ex said that ny bsf was shit talking me, and I believed her because I know that she can be nasty towards the people she doesn't like and doesn't even distance herself from those people either. I ended up confronting my bsf about it after she asked why I blocked her and she denied everything and was genuinely taken aback by it. We cleared things up in the end, but I worry that she hates me for believing her ex, or that I was stupid for believing her ex and that means I'm a bad friend/person.\n\nI also internalize every mistake I make and try to avoid them at any cost. For instance, I used to be so terrified of driving simply because I was mortified of making a mistake on the road. Yesterday, I accidentally ran a crosswalk in a parking lot because there was no sign and I was about to just stop the car and make one of my parents drive because, in my head, \"I fucked up. I can't do this. I can't believe I made a mistake. I upset everyone because I did that\".\n\nNot only that, but it's literally like everytime I make a mistake or don't know something, I actually, genuinely upset people. When I ran that crosswalk, my parents immediately got loud and yelled at me, especially my dad who just has to dwell on everything that goes wrong. And it's been like that since I was young so I get that the mistake thing may be like a trauma response or something like that. But it still makes me wonder if I developed a disorder because of it. I'm a maladaptive daydreamer, so who knows if I have something else.\n\nThe reason I bring up moral scrupulosity OCD is because I identify with a lot of the symptoms and compulsions such as:\n- Feeling responsible for others' wellbeing\n- Seeking reassurance about moral issues\n- Avoiding situations that could cause conflict (and make me feel immoral/like a bad person)\n- Excessively apologizing for a mistake or conflict (and then feeling bad for apologizing because it makes me think the other person thinks I'm being manipulative, though that's specific to me)\n- Constantly wondering if I did something wrong\n- Excessive guilt\n\nI have another, specific compulsion/ritual (at least I think it's that) where, if I were to put my empty sandwich bag or other garbage by someone, it would make them think that I think I don't like them or think of them as garbage.\n\nI don't know what's wrong with me and I'm sorry if I offend anyone diagnosed with these disorders. I'm trying to make as much of an educated guess as I can and wanna know what the rest of yall in the sub think.\n",

    "body": "Hi everyone,  \n\nI’m reaching out for advice or insights about a situation I’ve been dealing with for the past two years. After experiencing a drug-induced psychosis, I was put on antipsychotics and antidepressants. Over time, my dosage has been gradually reduced, and for the last three months, I’ve been taking only half a tablet of Cypralex (escitalopram) and half a tablet of Kempro (olanzapine) daily.  \n\nDuring my recent visit to my psychiatrist, I shared that I’ve been struggling with a complete lack of drive or passion to excel, succeed, or even engage in activities I used to enjoy. He mentioned that I might be experiencing something called **amotivational syndrome** (I think that’s what he called it—please correct me if I’m wrong). He explained that this could be due to one of three reasons:  \n1. Drug use (I’ve been clean for over a year, so this likely isn’t the cause).  \n2. Depression (I don’t feel depressed, so this seems unlikely).  \n3. An after-effect of the psychosis I experienced.  \n\nHe believes it’s probably the third reason—lingering effects of the psychosis.  \n\nHere’s the thing: I don’t feel like myself anymore. Before the medications, I had drive, passion, and a sense of purpose. Now, I feel like I’m just going through the motions. I want to get off these medications for good and regain the person I used to be, but I’m not sure how to do that safely or effectively.  \n\nHas anyone here gone through something similar? If so, how did you navigate getting off medications while rebuilding your motivation and sense of self? Are there specific therapies, lifestyle changes, or strategies that helped you? I’d also love to hear from anyone who has successfully tapered off medications under medical supervision and how they managed the transition.  \n\nAny advice or shared experiences would mean a lot to me. Thank you in advance!  \n",

I’ve always been pretty paranoid about “bad” things happening to me as a child, I used to lay down before I fell asleep and all I thought about was what bad things could happen to me. It’s started to get worse as I get older. I find myself struggling to be alone, ever. A few months ago i was having to get my stepmom to sit in the bathroom with me while I shower. It seems to be a reoccurring theme that there is someone coming to get me or hurt me, or hiding somewhere in my house. All of my nightmares consist of someone watching me, I remember the first time I experienced sleep paralysis it was one of the most frightening experiences, but I remember my dream just being a man following me in front of my house. I sometimes see “shadows” or things in the corner of my eye that don’t really appear to be there. Nothing extreme but it definitely plays into my paranoia. I’ve been wanting to solo travel and go places by myself and I recently bought these concert tickets  and was going to stay the night since it’s pretty far from me, but I remembered I would be alone and a horrible feeling came over me and I ended up inviting someone to come with me, even though I didn’t necessarily want someone else’s company I just can’t handle being alone. \n\nWhen I google my symptoms it says “paranoid schizophrenia”  ",

I'd hit my head on the wall if I had to say he'd stop touching my neck. Also, the girl randomly jumped on me or touched me and now I freak out at random touches. I'm asking if anyone might know if this is something like PSTD, anxiety, or if I'm just overreacting since the girl never did cut off my air.\n\nEdit: She did this multiple times for the 2 years I was in middle school. In high school, she acted nicer, and I knew she was better due to her asking to touch me and such. I still tried to stay away from her and attempted to move classes to avoid her or have my other friends talk to her. I got flashbacks throughout high school and still get them now.

I felt it for the first time and it lasted days to weeks, the time frame was so odd I'm not really sure.\n\nBut now it's how I feel most days. TMI but I've been on the toilet for a half hour because I am having a hard time feeling my bladder at the moment and I'm simultaneously afraid of pissing myself if I leave and second guessing that I'm even on the toilet and thinking I'm pissing myself now.

I'm 23 now and I have seen a doctor maybe twice since I was 18, both times before I was 20, and I last saw a Psychiatrist when I was 18, just long enough to be diagnosed with PTSD but not find out until a year after I stopped seeing him when I was looking up my medical records. I have very few diagnoses and just struggling. I feel doomed to fail and I've always joked about my problems but the fact that I feel so helpless so often is terrifying and I'm completely independent. If I can't function then I'm screwed.",

They only helped the panic that ocd itself brings because its so stressful and awful but its temporary relief and not worth what benzos come with so I told my Dr i was leaving them.\n\nI also have a chronic GI disease and it is linked to lack of serotonin. So i decided to finally give an SSRi a try. \n\nI started Fluvoxamine 25mg once a day, almost a month ago. \n\nOn week two of that, i went up to 50mg. \n\nIve been there since. \nI felt better the first few days on 50mg (thoughts were still there but not as brutal which is a relief and a blessing in itself) and all of a sudden i feel incredibly down and stagnant and the thoughts are almost worsening. \n\nNot sure if i should stay on 50mg for a few more weeks, in the hope that itll be enough of a a dose and i just simply have to give it time?\n\nOr is it not enough of a dose for OCD and i should just go up to 75mg for a few days, and then to 100mg?\n(Id like to not go over 100mg for as long as i can for now) \n\nPlease help. Ive heard and read and been told that im on way too low of a dose for OCD, especially OCD as severe as mine. Would really appreciate feedback from others that have actually gone through it. \n",

I have a learning disability as well as anxiety and depression, I was diagnosed at a young age. I struggled making friends in school and had a hard time learning, I was also in the mental hospital in 11th grade. I was doing decent for a bit, taking my meds, going to therapy, etc. I felt normal, like I knew who I was. But recently, I feel like nothings working, the thoughts of not wanting to live and feeling hopeless are back. I've tried working at 2 different places but I'm so horrified. The second time I cried infront of the supervisor. My dad thinks I'm lazy, he tells me \"I'm only hurting myself\" and I know that, but I just can't seem to fix myself. It feels like I'm in a world that isn't meant for me, everyone around me has a place or something they're good at, but I don't. I was very into art and writing but now I can't even bring myself to do the things I love. I cant even play video games, I just scroll on my phone all day. \nI'm just so stuck right now, everything seems impossible.

She got back on schedule with her medications. \nAnd then I remember begging her to be part of this family, because she had been abusing her meds again. \nI started drinking in middle school. I didn't stop. We had many pets, and in that sense I watched many of my pets due to not being able to afford vet care. I remember when we lost power on Christmas week and we froze all week. I remember boiling water to bathe and dumping water outside of my bathroom window because the tub wouldn't drain. \nI started cutting myself in middle school. Everyone thought it was because me and my friend had a falling out because my mother attacked her father. \nWe became friends again and I did stop cutting myself. I hated the attention it had brought me. I felt so empty. I started smoking weed and experienced my first panick attack. I kept smoking weed, I kept drinking. I was in high school when I met her. Her mom did cocaine, we did Cocaine. I missed a lot of school. I was quite drunk or high for most of my developing years. I got my first legal job at 17. I worked as much as I could. I started paying bills around the house. I felt helpful. I drank every night. \nI met him during high school. It started as a one night stand, but he had a car and knew how to get me off. I remember him calling me in the middle of the night for me to go meet him in his car and we'd go smoke weed and fuck until I had to be to school the next day. \nI started college a year after high school. I got worse then, but made good and bad friends. I fell in love, again. My love got arrested. I was 20 then. I moved back home and he moved in. We had been together the whole time. He became angrier. He would yell, he would scream at me day after day. Then he would hit me. I used to tell him no, but he would pin me. I stopped crying so long ago. I knew I didn't deserve anything else, not even death. \nI found out I was pregnant at 21. I hadn't gotten my period for 3 months. I still drank heavily. I even convinced my friend to cauterize a cut on his finger. I was 9 weeks when I was able to get my abortion. I had to go in for the vaginal ultrasound, there wasn't a heart beat. That broke me. I always wanted kids, but I couldn't have a child with this man, especially a dead one. I suffered alone with that. I bled and cried and drank and smoked. \nMy mom left me. I was in and out of therapy. He hated when I went to therapy. I had a good counselor, but I fucked that up too when I tried to sleep with him. Part of me thinks I still would. I had always planned on killing myself. It never got better for so long. \nAnd then I met my lover. He showed me kindness my own mother couldn't. He gave me refuge and love. We fucked too, of course. I left my ex. I tried to. I packed my stuff and left to go be with my lover and his kids. \nAnd that's where I'm at today. Nearly 4-5 years later. Still in and out of therapy. Now on medications and now clean. Diagnosed with Barrets esophagus, non dysplasia, and PTSD, Depression, GAD and probably more. But the last few months I started using body soap and a loofah, in addition to my very few self care routines and now I use lotion on my bumpy arms. I go to the gym. I just graduated with my RN degree and have a high chance of passing my boards. I fell in love with caring for people when I became a CNA. I am surrounded by healthy animals who's bills I can afford. I have such a patient and loving man helping me navigate my crazyund and crazy past. I get frustrated with myself easily, and he reassures me constantly. It's not a perfect road for either of us. Lots of trial and error, especially getting me sober or navigating my moods. I talk to my family again and I miss them now. I see them more. I have good relationships with people. I did lose a lot of my old friends, but I had to. I am doing so much better, and of course I still fuck up and of course I still cry all the time, but I'm healing. I'm 28 and I should of been dead at 25. I do not want to kill myself. I just want to be a little better every year. \nDon't give in, never give up. It's tough. And I'm still fighting my head every day, nearly every second. But it does go silent at work. Or when I see the kids having a moment or when we go to fairs. It helps.",

If you watch it, you’ll see a psychology student reflecting on how her first day working as a “psychologist in training” at a psych unit for children didn’t go as as expected because she saw a patient (a child) eating their own feces. The comments range from shock to laughter and others just being entertained at what must’ve been a very humiliating experience for a child who was probably in a traumatized and/or severely impaired mental state. \n\nOn tiktok I see many mental health practitioners or therapists/interns/psychologists talking about their patients. Normally I would just get upset and move on, however I noticed that this TikTok video came from a content creator, Sarina, who actually is a psychology student at an Ivy League school that claims her tiktok account is meant to educate others (she even names her account “psychandeducation”).\n\nI have been in psychiatric units and I’ve shared with the staff, and on one occasion with a group of psychology interns, many embarrassing stories and details about my trauma; mainly because I trusted they would reserve all judgment and trusted that what I said and did in the psychiatric unit would be kept confidential. So seeing her (Sarina) violate patient confidentiality and that trust patients have with their mental health treatment team in psych units made me upset enough to leave a comment. She should not violate patient-provider confidentiality and judge a patient, especially one that is a child, with severe mental illness. Not to mention going on to share their experience for tens of thousands of strangers to laugh at on the internet. \n\nIn my comment, I said “but they’re mentally Ill smh” and several people liked it. She responded that she actually has no judgment and this was meant for education (I’m not going to bother explaining how that’s just not the case). Anyway, I ended up commenting back: \n\n“I have no judgment for this at all!” *proceeds to judge a child with severe mental illness for tiktok clout* \n\nShe deleted my comment and blocked me less than a second later.

At the end of the day yes, we all do have to eventually toughen it out and get over it, but when you try your best to move on every day exerting excruciating amount of effort. it just gets me mad because that's not how it works at all, if you can then that's good but for me, I've tried to and it doesn't work that easily for me.\n\nmental illness is real, you cant toughen out everything just like in one go in a day, pain doesn't subside like that, when you've experienced trauma. It just really makes me mad when people say that its really insensitive when I'm trying my best, I know that's what I have to do. its like people don't think that you have to move on but I do, I try to \"get over it\" everyday adopting new mindset's and being excited about the future and working on myself constantly every day to the point where its my main priority no work just working on my mental health. SO believe me when I say its a lot harder than just getting over it, there are ups and down's but remaining up all the time, while inst the midst of recovery is really hard.",

    "body": "It's almost like I don't have my own personality. A few years ago, I'd constantly try to get people to describe me; Part of it was because I wanted to get people to compliment me, but now that I think about it, I think most of it was because I wanted people to tell me what they saw in me because I didn't know how to describe myself or who I even was.\n\nIf I'm talking to someone, I'll end up:\n\n- Mirroring their personality. I start acting like them, obviously. My values are entirely based off of theirs. You know how people can actually start showing traits (positive or negative) of something if they read about it enough, even if they didn't show any signs of it before? That, but with people.\n\n- Becoming what they 'need'. Someone is in a very bad mental state? All of my energy is dedicated to helping them, even if it destroys my mental health in the process, and my personality entirely becomes \"therapist friend who helps everyone.\" This sort of relates to the next point.\n\n- Becoming what they describe me as, which is based off of the previous two points. If they describe me as confident, that's how I'll act around them.\n\nIt doesn't feel like I'm repressing my 'true self', but I never feel like myself either. I don't consciously do any of this. I end up thinking my personality has always been the way it is at the time, with the exception of how I feel now; I can only think about mental illness and all of my problems. It's helpful for becoming aware of what I do and why, but I don't exactly enjoy only being able to think about everything that's wrong with me.\n\nIf I'm not talking to people, then my personality sometimes bases itself off of whatever my current interest is. It becomes everything I talk about, all I can think about, and I start to plan my future around it. My personality literally becomes \"I like this thing a lot. This is what I'm passionate about.\"\n\nI don't know how to feel like myself when I don't know who that even is. Being bored is one of my least favorite feelings because I feel so lost. I don't care about not having a distraction from my thoughts, it's just that I'm forced to deal with the emptiness being so much stronger. I can't distract myself from the feeling of not knowing who I am.\n\nI never realized just how much all of this bothers me until now.

It makes me wish there were better options and that we all had our basic needs met in a significant way without having to jump through hoops, struggle alone or go into debt.\n\nI sometimes imagine what this country would be like if the government actually cared about people more than money. If they actually invested more in people and environment than the military and big business. If the people here had their basic needs met, a good education and didn’t have to struggle so much to survive, I dont think mental health would be nearly as big of an issue. think about it, if you had what you needed: a safe space that you own, healthcare without dealing with insurance, a supportive community, a healthy environment, a purpose, healthy food and all the resources you need to live well, would we be as ‘ill’ as we are? If you didn’t have to be rich to get socialized services, would you be happier and more successful? \n\nI like to imagine sometimes what a good alternative to psych hospitals and anti depressants would be like but if this country took care of its people better, I think that would “treat the cause rather than just the symptoms.” I realize what im describing is more socialism. I just think having compassion and caring for your people is more important than money or power because what are we without each other or support? lonely, angry and afraid. I also partly blame the rich for taking advantage of the ingrained individualism in this country encouraging the poor to fight amongst each other so we don’t turn that anger on ‘them’.  what do y’all think? what would you change about this country so that the people benefit from it?\n\nyou can respond if you weren’t born in the US.",

    "title": "I grew up with a mentally ill parents. Mother had depression and bipolar and and father had rage issues. Terrible together. Absolutely terrible.",
    "body": "I hated my father until I was in my 20s. Ever since I could remember he would scream and yell and break shit like a 2 year old having a meltdown over everything. If my mother didn't have the house clean or if my mother didn't make peas with supper or if the Christmas tree wouldn't stand up straight. My mother slept all day and would forget to feed me. I was 4 I believe, I know I wasnt in school yet. My mother would get up to send my brother to school and then would go back to bed. I would use the VCR and watch Cinderella over and over and over. If I got hungry I'd  go get stuff out of the fridge.  I would cry if I got to hungry and I couldn't find anything to eat. I'd cry and cry and try to wake my mother to get up and she wouldn't.  She would moan and fall back to sleep. I remember crying so much and I had my Cinderella shoes on (my mothers heals) and I was kicking and my shoe flew off my foot and smashed the window. My mother finally got up and cried she knew my dad was gonna be mad.\n I remember her hugging me and saying sorry. My brother and i were left alone all the time from age 5 yr old and my brother was 8 and up. My mom worked nights and my dad worked days. When my mother left for work my father would wait til she left and then left us home by our selves. I dont know if he was to cheap to get a babysitter or just didnt care.  My mom would get home at midnight and found us alone and scared and crying. We lived in an old house beside a cemetery. So every noise scared us. CPS was called once maybe more but they only came to my house once and never came back. My mom cried all the time. She also lied and stole all the time and would take me with her when she stole and if she got caught she would lie...ill fast forward this. Years later when I was 12 my parents came into my bedroom and told me my dad was leaving. I never felt so happy. He was so mean towards my mother. I thought finally we can live happily. Boys was I wrong. I didnt know about metal illness. My mother couldn't cope. My dad took care of everything and did everything for her and worked so hard to keep food on the table. But as a kid I didnt see that. I saw just how mean he was all the time. My mother got very sick.. I didnt know what was going on. She started not eating except cottage cheese and jam. I tired getting her to eat other foods and she wouldn't. Then she started pretending to choke her self and buried our dishes in the snow in our yard. Also thought she was giving birth to my older brother. She started to forget who I was but always knew who my father was the great love of her life and my brother. She started to get jealous and mean towards me. One time I got home from school and I heard her screaming and I ran into her room and she called me nurse and asked me to help her. Said the baby is coming. Then pissed in her bed and said where's the baby. Where is the baby. And passed out. I called 911. She was in and out of the hospital. They kept sending her home saying nothing is wrong with her. I tried to get her to sign a child tax cheque so I could go get us (my mom, brother and I) groceries. And she flipped out said I gave her a pen that didn't work and that I must work for the government and punched me in the face. My mother never hit me before. Never. I then ran into my room crying and and she came after me. I was lucky i had a lock on my door. I called  my father to come get me that something is wrong with my mother as she was pounding on my door trying to get into hurt me. My older brother lived in the basement and I barely saw him. He use to be so mean to me growing up I didnt bother with him much.  It got to the point that I couldn't stay in the house with my mother and my friend mom let me stay with her. Finally after my mom lost so much weigh and was so so sick that my bother called my mothers sisters and they came down and the doctors finally took it seriously and she was admitted for mental health. My father moved back into the house and I moved back home. My father still a  Workaholic so I barely saw him but he wasn't angry anymore. There was no more yelling and he took us to go see our mother at the hospital. It was terrifying. Ill never forget the smell of the hospital and the people looked like zombies. My mother talked so fast and her eyes looked so different and she talked about God about how God heard her and is saving her and she showed me something she made in work shop out of clay. How she was in darkness in this cave and God opened up the cave and gave her light again. Fast forward to 6 months she was in the hospital. I was home with 2 of my girl friends and my mother came in the door and I said mom! I felt so happy to see her and she wouldn't even look at me like I didnt exist and she packed her things and left. Did not even say a word to me. Just left. I felt something change inside me that day. I was so hurt. My mother wasn't well but the love she gave me and showed me as a child when I got hurt or when I was having a bad day. It was like she could make it better. \nShe ended up moving back in months later and it she was different. It was like she didn't care about anything, blamed everyone for her problems, if she got caught in a lie she would blame it on something else. She didn't seem to care about anything other then money and stuff. She started filling our house with stuff. So much stuff and clothes. My dad stayed and his rage came back...\nI got sexual assaulted when I was 13 and my girl friend saved me from him going further with me. She heard me crying and telling him to stop... I never felt so scared. He made me look him in the eyes and kept telling me he wouldn't make me do anything I didnt want to do.... and i kept telling him i didnt want to do anything. He wouldn't listen. Tears running down my face as he was doing what he wanted. My friend and her bf came running over and said what the hell are you doing. He let go of me and I ran. I ran so fast. I didnt know where to go but to just run.....  I felt like I had no one to talk to. I got so depressed my friend told the guidance counselor at school what happen and she brought me in and then called the police. When my father picked me up from the police station. He said \"boys don't know what to do now a days\" and my mother cried and said nothing. It still bothers me to this day what my father said to me. Didnt ask if I was alright or he'd kill the bastard. He should of just said nothing like my mother instead of what he said.... We went to court and bc it was his first offense he got probation and had to stay 500 feet away from me. Boys seem to scared to even come near me. People at school didnt believe me. I heard them say how can you get sexual assaulted. She must of did something. I ended up quitting school. My father got a job in away and moved out again when I was 17. I got a job at subway and moved out with my boyfriend. Who would cheat on me and I would always take him back. I went back to school and got my high school diploma and I applied for college. I took my boyfriend with me to the city and left the town.... should have left him in the town. He brought me down so much. He quit his job while I was in school so we lived off on my student loans and I worked and I couldn't take the stress I quit school and focused on working. He signed up for the military. My father bought all the things he needed on the list to go. And he left. Bf  brother and preganet girlfriend move in with me to our small one bedroom apartment. (Thats another story...) anyways ill fast forward this too. We end up breaking up a year after the military. I was completely heart broken. I thought he was the one but I knew i couldn't take him back this time. I made a list of everything I ever wanted to try and do. I move in with my brother and then one by one I was checking off my list and I started to feel better and started having confidence and loving life. I went to 5 different dance glasses aweek, gym, I bought a pink bike. I always wanted a pink bike so I went out and got it for my self. I went para sailing, white water rafting,  tidel bore rafting \n, zip lining and going out with gf, getting my hair done monthly and read alot more books. Its funny the things you give up about your self when your in the wrong relationship. My ex ended up wanting me back 9 months later and I told him I'm never taking him back and that its over for good. I never felt so good to be rid of him.\n I wanted to have a relationship with my parents again so I got my license and would go home to visit and help them out and take them to doctors appointment etc we grew close. My dad went to therapy got help with his anger. My mother was always obsessed with my father. Wanted him back would cry all the time and then get really mean. It was an everyday thing. She wanted to know everything about him. Even when she had a boyfriend she would obsessed over my dad. It was so sad. I would tell her she has to move on and live a happy life. But its like she couldn't. My brother stopped talking to our mother. Couldn't deal with the toxic relationship. \nI met the love of my life from a different province when I was 26 and 2 years after we met we moved in together and started a family. \nMy mother got sick and had to get a bag when my first born was 5 months old. Her mental state declining saying horrible things about me and everyone. Very racist and  Homophobic said terrible things to the nurses and doctors.  She was pissed i couldn't take care of her. But I had a 5 month old and breastfeeding, I couldnt do much. She got home care but her house was so full of stuff they couldn't make it in past the livingroom. fast forward again...\nMy mother now imagines things, thinks people are following her, thinks her phones and house is tapped and says the most outrageous things to me. Said she had sex with her Psychiatrist but now thinks he's someone else bc his hair looks different or if he goes to the bathroom his twin comes out. Still obsessed over my father and they haven been together in 20 years. If i don't answer her calls she will call my inlaws say terrible horrible things that aren't true about me. She thinks I traveller's the world. I always say I wish that was true. But now this past year she started calling me awful names. I wont repeat but it is awful. And says if I dont let her talk to the children she'll call CPS on me and my job and my inlaws and say these hurtful and untrue things about me. I went to her family doctor and tried to get power of attorney but it was her  Psychiatrist is the one who deemed her capable! She lives in a house that is so disgusting filled with food, clothes, cat shit, and is imagining things but says she is capable. He wont even meet with me or our family.... I dont understand how he can deem her capable when he doesn't know the truth. Nor seems to care about the truth. Her family doctor, seniors safety and peoples protections are all involved and agree my mother needs help. But said they can't help people who don't want to be helped.  Unless I get power of attorney.  My father use to pay her Alimony but retired so she has no income except old age pension. She doesn't have enough for food and bills. I try and help with food but everytime I gave her money she would go out and buy stuff not food. \nShe is so mean towards me and I know its her mental health and I tried so hard to help her. But I get so depressed when I talk to her. I feel anxiety when I feel like I should go see her or talk to her. My kids are scared of her. \nEveryone in my family has disowned my mother even her church bc my mother would say the meanest untruthful things. She is alone. Makes me feel guilty she is alone. But she does it to her self. I tried so hard to get her help. Unsure what to do now. \nGrowing up no one asked if I was ever ok. No one talked to me about mental health. I honestly hate talking to her. But she's my mother so I feel guilty not talking to her bc I know she's sick.  I know she was physically abused and emotionally abused by her mother and by my father. I know she is ill. But sometimes I feel alone in knowing what to do and I dont want history to repeat its self. I dont want to be like either one of my parents.. \nI know it must be so hard being mentally ill. Its also so hard living with someone being mentally ill. When she has good days I end up crying. Brings me back to when I was little and how loving and caring she was. It doesn't last tho. No one talks about the kids who live or lived with mentally ill parents and how to cope.\n\nThank you all for the kind messages and hugs 🙂",

    "title": "I kind of want to just... let myself fall into a deep depression.",
    "body": "I don't really understand it. It's heavy and comforting. That sadness that seems to come from within your chest and then wrap itself around you until you become cocooned inside it. You don't want to move, eat, go anywhere, do anything, see anyone. Lay in bed for days. Leave dishes everywhere, stay in the same clothes for days, don't answer your phone. Let your plants die, pile up dirty clothes. It sucks. But it's warm and comforting like a nostalgia from years ago, like a weighted blanket you can't keep off of you.\n\nI used to have these kinds of episodes. On smaller scales, not super long periods of time, but I was dealing with this. Since then I've spend each and every day just clawing my way out of that blanket; forcing open the cocoon. Fight to keep myself functional, as a productive human being.\n\nI can't afford to go into a depression like this. I have a job, a life. But damnit if I'm not inclined to take a week or 2 off of work so I can fall into this again.\n\nDepression sucks. Don't get me wrong. I hate being in the middle of a delicious meal and then getting hit with a pang of deep sadness so strong that I have absolutely zero appetite and have to throw that great food away. At my worst I didn't eat for days. I tried to claw myself from that blanket and I just couldn't. That strength of fight I need to keep myself afloat just wasn't there. I would make myself bowls of top ramen just to take 2 bites of it, almost vomit, and pour it out. These episodes really suck. \n\nBut they're almost addictive. I have a hard time talking about this in therapy. I say that I almost want to be depressed, and they look at me like I'm crazy. Or worse, they'd gently, almost unintelligibly, raise an eyebrow and give a soft \"huh\" before writing something down on their clipboard. I hate the clipboard. \n\nBut I can't be the only one. It reminds me of times when my problems were different. Not better or worse, but different. When I would get joy out of laying in bed at 4 am, watching tim Burton movies and cutting (as edgy as that sounds- i only did it once). It made me incredibly sad, yes, but there's a lingering happiness behind just letting all that fight go and being awash in a thick, dark, warm cloud. And I can't help but wonder if I'm alone in this feeling.",

    "body": "aight so boom....\n\nas of 2017 i've consistently stayed fucked up. and i know what you're thinking \"drugs 🙄\" \n\nno bitch; i'm mentally ill.\n\nif you name it, i've probably got it. ADD, BPD, anxiety, depression and OCD. a four for four happy hormone deficient combo slapped right onto the brain of an 18yr old teen. \n\nwe been knew that i had ADD cuz i can't get a grasp on the ontario learning curriculum for shit. i've spent most of my school years in the \"troubled kids\" rooms doodling on test papers and devouring fantasy books for as long as i can remember. sure i'm smart (don't think for a second i'm not) but taking in mass amounts of information is hard, my brain needs time to sift and sort and organize.\n\nregardless, the ADD was nothing new.\n\nthen i had my first depressive episode. that tore through me like laxative in coffee and i got diagnosed with that as well. (the depression, not cosmic diarrhea) \ntherapy was the only option at the time because i was a youngin' and taking pills was NOTTT the vibe. naturally, as a lower-middle class family, we couldn't afford the long term counselling so i braved it like my ENFP self usually did and decided to battle it head on with fun activities and regular communication with my mum and doctor.\n\nthat lasted a month. i underestimated the disease....a mistake i wish i could go back and fix. fast forward past a few traumatic events and the list just began to grow. i became well aquatinted with OCD and BPD (borderline personality disorder). \n\nfrom there it spiralled.\n\nafter becoming somewhat accustomed to the royal ass fucking the cesspool of diseases had to offer me, i spent the rest of my junior/senior years smoking weed to help ease the crushing weight of the trauma and symptoms. skipping class, coming home late, spending money i didn't have, ignoring every warning sign my body offered me by staying high as a military fighter jet from the second i woke up to when i would eventually pass out from the 6 sometimes 7 bowl hits. even then, in my sleep, i was tormented by nightmares. i never allowed myself to process what i was feeling and how it was affecting me....outside of the few hours at night i'd lay awake silently screaming and crying.\n\nfor help. for release. for an end.\n\ni felt alone. my mind was no longer my kingdom. and my body, which had been recently violated at that time, was peeling away from the fragile bones within them. i was lonely, desperate for a release, hungry for love that would heal me, frantically searching for a way out of the grave i had been digging for myself the moment i decided to i was no longer worthy of anything besides misfortune.\n\nmy mother (god bless her) can read me like a sticky note, but there was only so much she could do and to my fault, only so much of my pain that i would let her see. \n\nat that point i had began to run.\n\nfrom my problems, from my home where the eyes of my loved ones widened with worry any time i'd skip a meal or look up at them with sunken features. i spent days away at my friends house, and when her and i weren't smoking our problems away, i hollowed in my bedroom.....\n\nthe girl i once knew, bright and cheerful, smiling at anyone who would look her way, loving loud, laughing freely, devouring book after book, drawing abstract art and conjuring the most elaborate stories with that stunning imagination of hers, was gone. \n\nin her place, stands me. \n\ni don't know who i am anymore if i'm being honest. only who i used to be....and anytime i try to seek out a new definition for the person i've become and want to be it only adds insult to injury.\n\neach hug, word of praise, \"you're so strong\" \n\n\"we love you\"\n\n\"you'll get through this\"\n\n\"you'll be okay\"\n\nfeels like road salt packed on the giant festering wound in my chest. the back of my skull hangs open, my brain unaccustomed to the fresh air of positive reinforcement and unconditional love. i feel naked now. vulnerable. afraid of myself and what it means to carry this weight any longer. \n\nsince quarantine's started i've then been diagnosed with anxiety after a horrible panic attack that sent me to the hospital.\n\ni sit for hours trembling in blankets, staring at the paint of my living room walls struggling to focus on something....ANYTHING that'll stop the cold pulsing in my head and jaw. my heart skips beats, they say the palpitations are normal but each one is a stinging reminder of my existence and how expendable it is at the hands of these...things. crawling, slithering, groping through the crevasses of my brain. killing me softly. \n\nmy body, unfortunately, answers to their calls.\n\nthe symptoms are normal apparently, and i think that's what scares me the most because i feel like i'm dying every second of the day and i'm expected to live like that. like this.\n\ni stopped smoking and that's been a journey in of it self lmao. but more than the desperation to fling myself into the frozen atlantic ocean, weighted down by my despair and a bag of bricks, i'm eager for peace and fulfillment. for change and a future that i have a say in....not the depression or BPD or anxiety.\n\nsigh.... \ni don't know where i thought i was going with this. i lost the motivation to continue typing a while ago but it feels nice to vent :) i've got a consultation with a therapist in a few days and a call with my doctor after that. i'm hoping i can find excitement in the forward movement....\n\ni want to get better. i want to be better for myself. i don't wanna die but i don't wanna live like this anymore (word to bea miller :p) i'm hoping i can learn about my new self and how to love her the same way i loved younger me.\n\ni'll name this new era of self improvement and discovery \"the age of circes' bloom\" in honour of the firsts book i've read since this whole fiasco started. \n\nCirce by Madeline Miller. \n\nand like the herbs in Circe, daughter of Helios and witch of Aiaia's lush garden; i will bloom. i will flourish. i will grow.",

I forgot to say when he was young his parents abused him and he experienced a lot of bad things living in housing projects in a bad area. \n\n\nEdit 2: I forgot to add my dad has a facisnation with homeless people. He loves to see people struggle and always watches videos on homeless people and skid row, one of his favorite youtube channels is “invisible people” and he forces me to watch that with him and says i’ll be like that if i leave him and he says hes my only protection from that. Also he’ll brag about his house to homeless people if we run into them infront of a store or something. \n\nTl:dr: I think my dad is nuts and i need advice on what to do",

    "body": "TW: Suicide attempt, inpatient treatment\n\nSo I'm diagnosed with Bipolar 1 Disorder, PTSD and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. I'm also an alcoholic but I'm not getting that diagnosed. I work in mental health care because it's my life and my love and my calling. I have for 3 years, it's everything to me. Generally I can deal with very horrible things okay, like I'll get drunk or have a panic attack but I'll be okay in a couple of days. \n\nBut today something new happened. For context, I'm currently working at a psychiatric hospital (which I've done before) but in the adolescent unit for the first time in my career, starting about a month ago. It's been really hard but I love it. I love working with adolescents, I'm 27 and look/act 22 (according to myself and multiple patients) so that probably helps. But I just adore them. \n\nToday a patient, a 14yo girl, was so suicidal she was on 1:1 observation. We had to physically hold her this morning to keep her from bashing her head into the wall during a suicide attempt. Tonight it got worse. She tried every way to hurt herself (I really don't care to describe it all). It took 5 of us women (men trigger her even if they're within 3ft of her) to hold her down. Several women switched out but I stayed on her legs for the full 40 minutes because I had built a good relationship with her and I figured out how to position my body so that even when she pushed and kicked, she wouldn't hit my bones or anything. Unfortunately 2 of the other staff members didn't do the same. She kept screaming, begging to die. I've had those thoughts and screamed those things myself. Word for word. Every time a man came within 3ft of her, she SHRIEKED. And the supervisor/RN during that particular shift was a man, so he had to be at least somewhat nearby. \n\nI don't think I will ever forget this as long as I live. Her screams and shrieks, holding her as gently as I could, knowing that she is fucking FOURTEEN and in this kufh pain. I mean I was too at her age, but I know that's so far beyond normal there are no words for it. \n\nAnd I'm so scared that I'm now going to have a panic attack whenever someone screams. When I got home, a kid in the parking lot of my apartment who was playing catch with another kid screamed and I dropped to the ground and covered my ears. All I could hear was her screams. I can take this for a month. But what if this is another whole cause of ptsd coming on? I'm not leaving this career. I'm not leaving them, ever. But I'm scared that this may do some serious damage to me when I already don't have my own illnesses under control.",

This illness isn’t just wanting things symmetrical or being a tidy person. for a lot of people, my self included, it’s really disabling. It makes me constantly hate myself and tells me all the time that I’m a horrible person, it causes great neurosis and right now I have a huge rash on my arm from over washing, among other symptoms, it has truly destroyed my ability to function like a normal person and seeing it treated like a joke really messes with me because of that.

I wear shorts in my house usually, and he'll make these comments, \"I want to lick you\", \"I'll bite you on your ass\" and it makes me really uncomfortable.

He makes me want to kill myself. I want to live, but I don't want to live with him, I don't want to be near him. It's been going on for about 8 years now. I really hate this. When I was younger, I had written this letter to my mom saying that I was sorry for all she had to go through, he'd fight with her a lot too. I apologized and said that I should've never been born, that it was my fault for being alive. That man made me regret being alive at 9 years. I want help, I really do. But I can't get it.
